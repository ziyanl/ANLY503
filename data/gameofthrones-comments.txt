Highgarden during the Golden Age of Mace the Ace
I'm not a big fan of heat so I can't see myself living in Dorne. I also would not want to living in the empty wasteland which is the north. I hate living in the country so I would want to be closer to one of the more urban centers. In the West I would need to worry about ironborn so that eliminates Lannisport and Oldtown.  I think the Vale would be the place for me, it's untouched by war and economically stable. Gulltown specifically would be a wonderful place to live.
Probably somewhere in the North. I enjoy cold weather. 
Somewhere warm, probs Highgarden. 
dorne without a second thought
Dorne
Oldtown - because its warm, and there's the citadel 
I hate really hot temperatures of a desert during summer so dorne isnout but I'd probably visit in the spring and fall. Maybe go for week to check out the beaches and vineyards

The westerlands are probably really nice but i hate the lannisters so i wouldnt want to live there. 

I understand overthrowing yhe Targaryens when the Mad King was ruling so i wouldn't have sided with The Reach. 

The Stormlands sound to be getting hit with hurricanes all the time like florida. 

Tarth wouldn't actually be bad if it doesn't deal with the storms. You're isolated from the main kingdom so most likely untouched by the rebellion but still loyal to House Baratheon. Lord Selvin Tarth sounds like a cool dude according to Brienne"s stories. And its supposed to have beautiful saphire waters.

The riverlands are always destroyed during anywar. Younhave a couple good houses like the tullies but the riverlands really seem like the trailer park of westeros with the freys and such.

The Vale, mountains are beautiful and a very secure land. Jon Arryn is a good lord even if his son is a bitch and his wife a bit crazy. The Lords of the Vale are some of the most honorable in all the seven kingdoms. Definitely not a bad spot. 

The North is nice right now during the long Summer, but like Lord Stark says, Winter is coming. And the Winter in the north is fierce to be sure. You have one of the best lords in the seven kingdoms if not the best. Their family is known to take care of the north and the people who live there. The land is big enough to never feel like you're taking space from a neighbor. But again winter in the north is fierce. 

The neck while fun to explore is a swamp infested with insects like mosquitos and poisonous animals with not much game to hunt or land to farm. 

Dragonstone: get me away from the crazy red priestess, and stannis' wife is weird. 

Iron islands just nah man

 
Conclusion in think tarth wins

Riverlands would be ideal for me. Lots of rivers for trade and fish, temperatures not in the extremes, nice forests, what more could someone want?

That or Winterfell with it's hot springs and heated walls.
I feel like Highgarden is the obvious choice, but my second pick would probably be the Eyrie. Impregnable!
I'd live nowhere and be no one...
Dorne sounds kinda idlyilc, but also very hot, which I don't like. I'll go with Oldtown, because it has the Citadel, which seems like a cool place.
In peacetime? Riverlands for sure.

Beautiful rivers, forests and farms.


I'm surprised that nobody has responded King's Landing.

Warm climate, bustling city life, lots to do, plenty of room for growth for people who are willing to play the game.

I'd love to give that a shot.
I'd have to go with either the North or the Vale. 
Winterfell probably. Or Ironwrath.
Highgarden because of warn and rich 

If it has to be Westeros, I would be in White Harbor as a silversmith. Good weather, fishing spots, lots of work to do and very peaceful and progressive.   

If I can choose another country, I would love to be a Braavosi or a Qohori.
Wherever the Observatory is. 

"Myrish eyes mounted on tripods could be used to observe the stars.[5] There were also dedicated observatories, including one kept at Winterfell by Luwin" - Wiki of Ice and Fire. 

Well, that answers that.

Roomies with tormund giantsbane 
The Vale. Scenic and secure.
Dorne, good food, good women, good climate
Probably the Vale, mountains are pretty and it's pretty damn safe 
I'd probably say Starfall it's the perfect location. It's right on the water and it's in the most free and open minded place in the seven kingdoms.
Anywhere Daenerys goes. 

that or the Red Keep.  

Qarth and Meereen were also pretty. 
[removed]
Winterfell under Ned Stark. 
I'm a skier, so in the mountains of the Vale. But I also hear Winterfell has great hot tubs.
Dorne, Oldtown, or if I am nobleborn King's Landing cause then I could play the game and cliiiiimb the laddahhh.
I think Highgarden is obviously the most pleasant choice, and the ruling family seem like less horrendous people than most others. Also it's the closest thing to California in GoT. 
Dorne. I'd prefer to live somewhere with a warm climate. And Dorne has better laws than the rest of Westeros.
Highgarden, Old Town, or Show-version Horn Hill -- Anywhere in the Reach so long as it's relatively populated and urbanized. Food is plenty, and by plenty I mean people don't die by the thousands because of famine. Cultural development in the reach is relatively superior to the rest of Westeros. And the climate is far friendlier than the crazy climates or geographies of literally all the other kingdoms and Dorne.
Reach man to my heart! No bullshit going on there, wars aint really much of a thing. Only big worry is getting recruited into the army and that isn't even a huge issue since as far I can tell, they haven't been in a big battle since the Blackwater (At least in the show, in the Books there was also Dragonstone). Also its got the best temperature and good wine (more of an ale man, but doubt I ever want to go to the Riverlands).
Well I would want to live North 
Oldtown or the Arbor. Wine, warmth, women, wisdom and wealth, what's there not to like?
The iron islands
I wanna live in the land beyond the Walls with no white walker and no Wall of course..haha
Is that like a styrofoam egg with coloured pins glued onto it? If not I'd be interested in how you made these
i have one of these i picked up at a craft fair for like 3 or 4 bucks. they made it with one of those cardboard art eggs and silver thumbtacks then lightly went over it with a blowtorch to discolor the tacks to a neat red, copper, and blue hue.
very cute, I love it, and a great gift idea. If someone gave me one of these I'd be happy
I would cover that with matte modpodge
I'm thinking of cutting it open and putting something heavy in the center to give it some weight then super gluing it back together. Great idea.
Ahh this is such a clever and simple idea, love this! 
These are really cool! I wonder if there are larger styrofoam eggs to make them a bit closer to scale though...
Hope those dragon eggs comes out top-first.
I did a few also, it is very therapeutic! Love the colour you chose here! 
Can I be father of dragons ?
I want all three. 

I need a very large army. 
I did the game of thrones gift exchange last year and my secret santa gave me 3 of these!
guide? :)
I. Love. This.
I would love to buy a set of three from ya!
lovely!
I love making these!  I made two small ones and a large one, unfortunately for me my cat really liked them and destroyed them. then I just quit making them. 
dope
Very well done! Neat
That looks awesome. Great idea!
It would make a very cool tree ornament 
But they can't return this back to Walmart tho. That's not fair.
Any instructable or Youtube video on how to do this? 
Be my friend plz
"Noone wants you dumb eggs Jen"
-Some guy probably

Wouldn't the proper plural be, "Mother's of Dragons"?
But why....? It's a beautiful tattoo, but to me it falls into the same category as band names or meme tattoos
A good got tattoo? Wow I'm impressed. 
Unreal tattoo man.  Why do all the good realism artists have to be thousands of miles away from me.
That is a bloody good tattoo, mate.
Hahaha, you want that dumb grimace on your body for the rest of your life?

Congrats...I guess lol
wow. That is hands down the best GoT tattoo that I have ever seen.

I've seen a lot of neat GoT tattoos, but this is another level. It's like a bionic tattoo or something. 
Or a Kit tattoo 
I would rather get a tattoo of that photo of him standing on the beach wearing sunglasses
I am sure there will be no ragrets later in life.
The blood didn't translate well and looks more like a leper. It is one of the best realistic tattoos I have seen though and i am sure was worth the money paid. Not one I would personally get, but I don't even know if I would get a tattoo. I just don't like the idea of something always there that I would have to cover up for events and such where I need to be professional. 
ugh why? a tattoo of an actor playing a fictional character from a book....so odd
How many people got I Love Lucy, Happy Day's, or MASH tattoos 30+ years ago? Honestly, I get that it's a great (AMAZING) show. But in 30 years, he'll always have that tattoo on his arm reminding him of a 2D TV Show that no one remembers.

I'm not bashing the guy, I'm all about people doing whatever makes them happy, I do like learning about decisions people make. I'd like to ask OP (or the guy who got the tattoo) why they did it? I mean, I get the feeling that to do something like this, it has to be more than a cool scene from a show. Did the show help you through a really hard time in your life? I'd like to understand the motivation for making what to others is a simple form of entertainment into such a permanent part of your remaining life.

Thanks, and nice tattoo.
Amazing tattoo, would look better without the comparison pic though I think 
I could see a dope start sigil with winter is coming under it or something, but the actors face ? I dunno i wouldn't do it
That's badass man, looks great. I would not of payed for that dudes shoulder in the background though, probably save a few dineros

Ned.

Just fucking tell Jon already so we can get on with the Jonerys legacy
I know it's awful hard to come back from having your face squished in, but Oberyn Martell. Pascal played him perfectly. Would love to see him join forces with the Queen of Thorns. 
Khal Drogo.
He was supposed to be such a feared warrior and we never got to see him in a real battle scene. It would have dramatically changed the story but man I'd love to see him fight on screen.
Tywin for sure. Say what you want about the guy, but he was the most stable ruler by a country mile.
Ned, if I'm being sentimental.

I know it's cheesy but that old-timey honor thing gets me every time.


Otherwise, Margery. She had so much potential, and had barely begun to use it. She was killed right after it felt like she was beginning to unfold as a character. We were just beginning to see how tough and intelligent she really was. 

And Dany + Margery scenes would have been awesome. 

  
Hodor. 
WUN WUN!!!

Make him captain of the Winterfell castle guard.

Not technically a person I guess, but close enough.
Margaery probably. It would be great if she came back and the remaining Tyrells could rally to form their own inter-Dany faction. Maybe switch sides to Jon if Jon wins a battle or something. Actually Margaery-Jon would be a strong marriage alliance.
I understand a lot of the issues with it, but Robb. He was my favorite character and his weakness was that he was emotional. I feel like that's somewhat forgivable, as that is most people's weakness in real life. I love the dude and would love to have him back  
Rickon, I don't get why he needed to die. Or maybe Margaery, she was one of the better characters in terms of her "character" (for lack of a better word). But I definitely want Rhaegar fucking back. He's got a shitload to explain! 
as much as I hate him, Joffrey.. Just so we can watch him be killed again. This time slower. 
No one. Valar Morghulis 
Barristan Selmy. :(
Summer, the direwolf.
Oberyn
I was gonna say Freddy Mercury but then i realised i was on the GoT section.. 

I'd take the Giant , wanted to see so much more of him. Series finale fistfight vs zombie mountain :D
The Mannis. He shall cleanse Westeros for good of all corruption and mismanagement 
Hodor, he was so loyal that he carried Bran around everywhere after being crippled and sacrificed himself just so Bran and Meera had a chance of escaping the White Walkers, and in return he gets messed up by Bran's warging abilities. He fucking deserves it.
Oberyn
My boy Robert
Stannis the Mannis, he is the one true King. 
Oberin Martell 
Ros! For selfish reasons of course.
Robb
The One True King Stanis the Mannis, duh! 
The one true king
Aeris, because fuck Sephiroth. 

Oh wait...wrong sub. 
Oberyn so he can get Ellaria and the Sand Snakes in line and lead the Martell army into war. It bothered me so much to see the Martell sigil flying in Daenerys' fleet given the fact that there is no Martell to lead them. This would also allow The Hound to go north with the BWB and Oberyn could get a second short at justice from The Mountain.
Barristan the fucking Bold
Now this is a hard question to answer because there are a few dead characters I want to see come back. Perhaps Oberyn it would be awesome to see that character again and also to see how he would react to finding out his lover killed his brother only catch is he has no head. Another person I'd like to see comeback is Stannis maybe Brienne never cut his head off and told him to run away and maybe he died later somewhere else from his wounds and Mel resurrect him it be cool to see how he would react to Jon taking Winterfell maybe he would side with Dany. Only reason I can't see him coming back is at he has no real reason to at this point in the story. However the one dead character I want to see revealed to be still alive is Rhaegar Targaryen it would fit the story there would be no catch to it and he would help make an alliance between Dany and his son Jon and like I said it fits the story
Hard decision. Certain characters i think it would do more harm than good. 

Oberyn so we have a good character from Dorne. 

Wun Wun cause giants are awesome and i want to see him hang out with Tormund more. And see tyrion's face when he see's a giant and realizes that speech he gave Jon about fairytales was arrogant and ignorant. 

Ned would just be cruel like someone else said. It'd be great to have him back. But you bring him back now, his eldest son Robb and wife Cat, brutally murdered, Rickon is dead. Arya not the same girl and all Sansa has been through. He'd be devastated and blame himself. 

Tywin would be interesting but futile as the Lannisters won't matter by the end of S7 in the grand scheme now. 

Doran would be good, another good dornish character. 

Jon Arryn, no real point

Lord Commander Jeor Mormont. He could lead the watch again and convince Jorah to take the Black. 

Robb Stark would complicate things in the north. Would he or wouldnt he just step aside for Jon?

Catlyn Stark love michelle fairley but no reason for her to be back unless she becomes you know who 

Fuck the Boltons

The Blackfish, he would have been a great General for the North and important family member for Arya and Sansa, too bad he didn't see it that way

Rhaegar would be cool and with how vague it was maybe he isnt really dead

Drogo would be legit he could really lead the Dothraki and I wanna see Momoa fight the wights. 

Barristan Selmy would be great but i would say his sacrifice was good eapecially after his speech to Daenerys about Rhaegar and the people of kingslanding

Mance Rayder would be interesting but unnecessary as i believe Jon and Tormund are fullfilling that role now together. 

The one i would really like to see is Ser Arthur Dayne. Maybe he isnt really dead and is in hiding in Dorne somewhere. He would onow who Jon is and having the sword of the morning fighting beside Azor Ahai against the White Walkers would be awesome. Have him give a speech kinda like Barristan gave Daeny in Essos when he first showed up. Like i failed your family before, i will never fail them again.  
Rhaegar
I'd like to see either, Catelyn Stark (Since in the books she's revived as Lady Stoneheart), or Rickon Stark; just because I feel bad for the guy and Melisandre could have jumped into the crypts and brought him back as a way of saying "no hard feelings" to Jon.
Oberyn Martell.
I'm gonna save my resurrection in case The Hound dies.
syrio forel, possibly one of the best swordfighters
Shireen Baratheon. Just because her death was the worst for me.
The legend of gin alley ofcourse!
Ned would fucking win the entire story if he came back.

The only reason he ate shit so early was because at the time of his journey to King's Landing there were still hundreds of moving pieces all about Westeros, and he hadn't witnessed the atrocities that happened in all 6 seasons to understand how carefully he had to posture himself. He wasn't a slouch politically speaking, but he was still in kind of a semi-honeymoon phase upon arrival, so he wasn't ready at all for the crap flying his way.

Revive Ned now and he'll not only be much more prepared to wage a dirty war (while maintaining his values), all the pieces have also pretty much fallen into place.

The North would either welcome him back with open arms as their top dog, or Jon would remain the King of the North and appoint Ned as a second in command. The clout Ned had in his life will more than surely help to rally the people of the North even further than Jon already has, and with that kind of power not even the skeevy rats back in King's Landing could hope to contest them.

Despite having been out of the game for many years now I'd say Ned *still* has way more experience than any of his children at leadership, so the inevitable war with the Lannisters and meeting with Daenerys will go much smoother and with less doubt. His having been dead for so long will also undoubtedly have given him some insight into the supernatural side to the universe, which would prove more than useful in the final battle against the Whitewalkers.

Iygrid 
Catelyn Stark.

Not even as Stoneheart. I just want Cat back.
Ned, always Ned. 2nd choice would be robb. Those are just emotional picks tho.

Story wise i would love to see Tywin react to a new KINGINDANORF formed under Ned's Stark bastard with the vale in his armys, a broken down riverlands with the frey's dead and the Targaryen girl that has been scaring him since season 1 finally moving vs westeros, with the tyrels and dorne at her side. Tywin planning vs Robb is what made season 2 so good to me and i would LOVE to see him plan and scheme vs jon an danny.
Cat.
THE KING IN THE NORTH *Pulls Sword out of sheath and kneels*
Rhaegar. 

Allegedly an amazing swordsman, poet, musician, and quite the looker. 

He would take the White Walkers seriously. He would be King, a Father to Jon, and a big brother to Dany. 
Jeor Mormont. Dude left his own thrown on Bear island for his son who's is now banished from westeros. Joined the knights watch, rose ranks and promoted to Lord Commander only to be stabbed in the back by his own men. Kinda wish they gave him a bit more screen time at his death. Or at least to pass on the message to Sam that he wanted Jorah to join the nightswatch. 
What about Jon arryn? This whole thing really took off when Lysa poisoned him. The Vale is one of the most militaristically functional regions in westeros right now. He had a hand in raising both Ned and Bobby Baratheon, for calming impulsive powers, for making objectively analytical decisions. I can only imagine what kind of pieces he could move if alive. If anyone could foster relations between Jon and Dany for the benefit of westeros, I bet he could and would  do it. The amount he's seen, what he knows,  so valuable.


Catelyn Stark. And i want her as Stoneheart, whispering throw a cut windpipe and hanging Freys!

I also want her to see Jon Targarien as KINGINDANORF
Margaret Tyrell gets my vote.  She had the most promise out of all the characters to seriously compete against and undermine Cersei.  I really wish she had lasted longer and rose to be the Queen of Thorns.  
Ygritte 
Tesla 
Doran Martell.  Had so much potential
Robb 
Old Nan, just because I want to hear more of her stories.
Rhaegar Targaryen, RIP sweet Prince!
Season 3 Daario 
Either Ros or Margaery because I'm a guy.
Has to be hodor, that poor poor soul
Robert Baratheon! Back in shape montage, followed by meeting and legitimizing Gendry, final scene of the episode is both suited up in Baratheon armor on horseback with war hammers slung over their backs, looking down on King's Landing from that hill everyone looks at it from. 
Oberon
The Sword of the Morning.
the boar
Meryn Trant, i loved the dude.

No, seriously, i want Stannis. His death just made no sense.
Ned 100% 
Gendry

RIP
I might bring book Robb Stark back. But not TV Robb Stark.
ned fucking stark what the fuck kind of a question is this
Why no votes for Ramsey Bolton?
[deleted]
Nora Allen. So that Barry can finally stop putting his dick in the timeline. 
This looks amazing think would make a great tattoo.. 
That's really great - thanks for sharing! 

Also - you do tattoo design I saw - is this something you actively do for profit, or just for friends/family? I'm curious, because I'm looking for a tattoo design, and would love to give a starving artist my money, rather than the local shop that's overpriced (though talented). 
have seen this picture/drawing/art so many times I only just realized the falling swords
Just to be clear I don't want to confuse anyone. There'a a popular image already created digitally with this concept. (I wish I could find the name to credit) I took the concept and did it in ink. Below is the season 4 poster with the same concept. 

https://cdn.suwalls.com/wallpapers/tv-shows/the-three-eyed-raven-game-of-thrones-31615-1920x1080.jpg


Just to clear things up. I'm not trying to claim the idea. I just thought it would be awesome to draw in ink :)

This is basically just copied from the original artist and is a very popular image. You should certainly have mentioned that in the title of this post.. I don't think it was your intention but this really seems like stealing. It's a nice piece but I can't help but feel like the 3k upvotes you've received are largely from people who believe that your work is truly original, because you've implied that quite clearly. 
Great work. 
Damn man this is awesome! It would make a great wallpaper. 
Looks great!
Hey that's pretty good
It's really well done, and i like your concept- mimicking the iron throne by having it be made out of swords...but- i have to add that i find the thick dark blades under the left wing, that kind of make a dark "z", to be rather distracting(and to a lesser extent, the one in the background, beneath the feathers of the right wing). perhaps it's just because they seem to be going in different directions than the ones around them...? are they supposed to be, or representative of, something other than just the same kinds of blades that make up the rest of the crow, or something else that i'm missing?

I'm not trying to piss on your work- i find it very good overall...i'm just trying to give an honest critique as i see it, rather than just more of the  mindless and mostly meaningless fawning these kinds of things often attract.

/u/Krausor Do you happen to work in Charleston? My friend got a tat that looks exactly like that one before coming up to college this year
LOVE this! You did an amazing job.

No joke, I would get this tattooed.
It's fine. I guess. 
This is fucking awesome man, nice one! 
I love this. 
Naw, this guy takes you to the Firelink Shrine.
Perfect! Bran would be proud. 
The Lannisters pressuring a Stark to hand over Winterfell

>Oh, and everyday he doesn't, people will die. Starting tonight. I'm a man of my woooooord. **MUYAHHHAHAHAHAHAHA!**
Duuuuuude
Any chance of getting the file? Looks awesome man great work! 
Three eyes crow 😢
Just browsed your Insta page, love all that work you do. I may steal a picture for a tattoo ;)
I love the transition from feathers to swords. This is brilliant.
Have you thought of adding a signature/initials to this somewhere, so that if/when people get tattoos of this, there's a little nudge of artist credit?
You should definitely make this to be able to be used as wallpapers 
The trailing swords...brilliant.  Awesome work!
The swords-feathers thing is a great idea. Never seen it before. Amazing work!
The Bran and Night King one makes me happy.
I looked forward to these almost as much as I did the actual episodes throughout this season

Never seen the Sandor chopping one. Good stuff!
JON AND DAENERYS MEET OH MY GOD. let's hope Jon knows he is a targ before hand so we do not get accidental incest
I love the outfits so much! It shows a real progression from the first season to now. I also love how they're representing the three leaders fighting for the throne. They're all also wearing black, a power color. 
god damn why is S7 so far away....I gotta get threw 2 round of finals before we get there FUCK.

My guess is Jon is there on a secret mission with Davos and he left Sansa and Tormund/manderlys or glover in charge of the north, while he treats with her. That is if it's early in the season.

If it's late then i guess the North could be with him, but that looks like Dorne so i guess the actual host of the forces would be in the riverlands or something
This is kinda old. Many photos and videos of this and other scenes have been around for months.
One thing I am noticing here is that Jon is leading Dany. Might be some hint that Dany will join Jon's cause instead of Jon joining Dany's.
i really wish i didnt click the link :( can never be unseen 
So leaping to loads of conclusions I speculate they are walking on Dornish sand on the way to Starfall to pick up Dawn.

Even if they are not this is still awesome.
Saw pics of them last month. Exciting stuff.
BY THE GODS!!!!
I wish i didn't see this
Those costumes tho! <3 
Nice armor Jon got on himself. I wonder if it's just a random armor or a special one.
Mance Rayder. The show significantly reduced his role. In the books he's still alive and plays an important role in the north
Ser Barristan Selmy.  While I love the character in the show, I feel like they have not conveyed what a badass he actually is.   
Dorian martell

Tywin is my favourite character brought to life though

Yeah, but that's one of the few changes I liked, I think it's fit her to not be as attractive as described.  I know it would have been hard to do, but I would have liked it if Tyrion lost his nose.
Doran Martell. In fact I ended up disappointed with much of the Dorne storyline in the show. The lack of Arianne didn't help.

I think I preferred book Sansa too. I'd say she garnered more sympathy from me.


The biggest dissapontment for me was Euron Greyjoy. Right now in the books it seems like he's gonna be a major player in the final arc and has warlocks and magic, meanwhile in the show the only magic he seems to have is his ability to tame dragons with his huge cock. 
Yeah pretty much him and his second sons.
The people of Meereen are holding elections.  Daario and the Second Sons are remaining behind as a standing military to keep the peace.
Haha cue the 'sad Daario' memes.
Once Mereen has a stable government of the people Daario and Second Sons will move on. Basically Daeny asked him for one last thing(to make sure the elections were carried out peacefully) with the masters and the harpies essentially wiped out everything will.run smooth there for the most part. Once he's fullfilled her last request of him i would assume they go back to being mercenaries unless Daario has more ambition after being around her for so long. But like he says who comes after Daenerys Stormborn? He will go back to being a drunk merc who sleeps around for the rest of his life always dreaming of his Queen. 
Unless Euron shows up at Meereen, I think that storyline is over for the most part.
He's left with the second sons to oversee the changes in Meereen
Yes, AKA the meereen plotline is fully abandoned, and I don't expect to see anything related to it in the future. 
No.  But the quick resolution of Daario "ruling" Meereen either means he is going to fail miserably and quickly.  Or, Meereen isn't important anymore and its the last we'll hear about it.
Yeah if I had to take a guess, I'm betting Dario is gonna be like "fuck it" and go look for work in the Free Cities. Def not the stationary, ruling type
I've been binging these. They provide a lot of backstory I wouldn't have known otherwise.

So... you're saying that there are actually two fates for humanity; one that ended in fire, and one that ended in ice. 

And that the story we are currently watching is actually a mashup between the two fates, and that Bran is simultaneously orchestrating them from the moment we are introduced to the story? to ensure that neither fate happens and humanity survives? 

That is some heavy stuff right there. 
So is he saying that the WW's and the dragons are existing in alternate timelines and only brought together for their own survival?
Kind of interesting. But way too tinfoil for my tastes. 
That is an interesting theory. And it would make for a cool story.

But there are scenes where Tyrion talks about both White Walkers and about Dragons. He has been to the wall though has not seen WW, and he definitely seen Dragons.

There are a few other incidents like that as well that debunk it.

But I like it because as far as I know dragons and white walkers have never been spoken about at the same time. But most of Dany's persona comes from the fact that she has dragons and that why she echoes in Westeros. And people in Westeros deal with people in the North which deals with wildlings as well as the WW.

Sound like a cool theory, but wait, how would have Yara Greyjoy in this case met Daenerys in 6x09?

If I understood correctly, your friend suggests that North and South stories are in parallel universes, but too many characters from both "worlds" have met.
People theorize that the hounds in that episode were merely tracking hounds that weren't bred for combat like the other ones Ramsay's known for (otherwise they would have torn Sansa and Theon apart when they found them)

Jamie is one of the characters in the books who seems to be flexible with his personal code of ethics. He is not so black and white about good and evil and honor and disgrace as Ned Stark was, for example. Early in the books he seems like a character completely without morals... But as the books go on, it turns out he does have a personal code of ethics albeit a nuanced one. I think being called Kingslayer bothers him because it removes all context from what happened and how evil The Mad King was... I also think it bothers him because that title overshadows all other accomplishments and titles he has, which would offend his rather large ego. 
People use it as an insult against him on the basis that, as a member of the Kingsguard, he "betrayed" his oath of protecting his king. Jaime thought it was the right thing to do, and objectively, it directly saved innocent lives, but people see his act as dishonorable and cowardly. So he doesn't like the nickname because it's basically name calling

Honestly I don't think he hates it so much. Maybe in the same way that Jon Snow hates being called bastard or Tyrian hates being called imp. I think he has learned to wear it like armor the same way those 2 have. And in a weird way it actually brings him closer to his brother. Both are labeled and neither really deserve the ridicule they get. Tyrion was born that way and Jaime saved the city from a fiery death.
I think it's because it comes from a place of ignorance. Most people don't know the exact details of the murder, and I don't think your average commoner knows that Aerys had a very real plan in place to blow up the entire city. Without that knowledge, Jaime killing Aerys just seems like a cowardly act to save his own hide.  Haven't read the books in a while but I think Jaime rarely actually asks people to call him Jaime instead of Kinglsayer, and the one time I do remember is right after he's explained the murder to Brienne. To me that kinda implies he would expect people not to use the name if they actually understood why he did it. 

I might be wrong there but that's my two cents. 
Considering how much the whole Walk of Atonement cost to produce, imagine how much a Myrish Swamp would drain the budget
Book wankers will know why you want that character in there with Cersei

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Might be a bit late for that now I reckon! Especially now that Margery is dead too. 
I have said this before, but I don't see them introducing any more major characters in the next two season, except for possibly Howland Reed. 
Preferred:
If Dany survives, and King's Landing is destroyed as in her House of the Undying vision, I'd like the last shot be her walking among the smoking ruins of Old Valyria. And then as everything is starting to fade, a faint scream of a dragon is heard from a distance. Cue the ending credits.

Realistic:
This is a harder one. Maybe it could be this epilogue type of thing with Tyrion drinking his wine, the Imp's Delight, with someone else that has survived it all, in some peaceful-looking place as the sun is setting, or something like that. 
I like your realistic ending, and I think it would fit the whole series pretty well. I am concerned we will get a "happy" ending where Dany lives and ends up on the throne. It would be a pretty big disappointing to have such a straightforward ending considering how complicated and deceitful the rest of the story has been.
Its going to be an old Maester Samwell finishing writing the great history of the war of the 5 kings and the return of the white walkers and closing the book before putting it on a shelf in the Citadel. 
Preferred: Jon marries Sansa after finding out that he's actually her cousin, becomes King of Westeros and chooses Winterfell as his castle. Davos moves his house closer to Winterfell and serves as Hand to the King. Bran becomes Lord of Harrenhal (because it's close to The God's Eye where there's a shitload of Heart Trees) so he can keep up his duties as The Three Eyed Raven. Edmure takes back his seat as Lord of the Riverlands. Jaime takes the black and becomes Lord Commander. The Night's Watch becomes a force that enforces Jon's rule beyond where the Wall was. Cersei dies. Dany's dragons are dead so takes what's left of her army and sails west to conquer whatever is out there. Kings Landing is in ruin and the Kingsland is absorbed into the Stormlands. 



Realistic: A lot of people die (including Jon) die in the final fight with the White Walkers and whatever's left are ruled over by Dany whose pregnant with Jon's kid. Bran goes back beyond the Wall with Meera, Sansa becomes Wardeness of Winterfell, Arya sails west and Tyrion takes his place as The Hand of the Queen with Davos Master of Ships. 
It's threads like these that make me so thankful for GRRM.

The final confrontation with the white walkers takes place in a blizzard.
Many heroes are lost. Who and how doesn't matter.
Some of the dragons die too.
Only one of the dire wolves remains.
The Night King is defeated, what remains of the WW/Others flee. All the wights drop dead once the Night King has fallen.
A couple scenes with the remaining heroes sheltered somewhere from the blizzard. They're preparing for the long night.
The camera pans towards the horizon... We get a tiny glimpse of the sun rising and then an immediate cut to black.


As for what type of ending we get... These moments in Westeros history have to mean something, something has to be different than the hundreds and thousands of years before. So in that regard I think the ending should be "happier" in the least that it is definitive progress towards a better world. Cause if it just ends sad and with no progress towards a better world then why tell us this story and not of Aegon the Conqueror? Or of Robert's Rebellion? 
This would be the ultimate dick-tease ending but:

The War for the Dawn is lost and The Others have slaughtered almost all of the living (including Jon and everyone else we ever knew) except for Daenerys but all of her dragons are dead, she retreats to the ruins of Old Valyria in her grief. However once there she walks amongst the volcano's that may or may not have brought the doom. There in a cave she finds a large amount of dragon eggs (about 100 lets say) resting amongst smouldering coals. One of them shakes timidly and then cut to black.
Preferred: Grand Maester Samwell has just finished telling the story of The Game of Thrones to a group of small children and they shouting at him "Tell us about King Jon" or "Please give us the story of the Mother of Dragons again" 

Realistic: Jon Snow is King and is sitting on the Iron Throne with Ghost by his side and you can hear Ghost howling as the credits begin to roll
Any "turn" at the ending scene will cheapen the whole story and GRRM is not a cheap writer.  He actually is very good at storytelling and weaves complexity into the plots (few holes) and has well-built characters.  So...I do not think Jaqen ends up on the throne.  

Preferred: Jon dies.  He wants to die and is willing if need be.  He has become a great Stark and there's nothing left after (if) he defeats the WW.  That leaves Dany on the throne and a good and great Queen with Tyrion as Hand.  Camera shot of Dany on a dragon flying away from the wreckage of the Ice Wall with the morning sun coming up.

Preferred: Daenerys is sitting on the Iron Throne with her dragons guarding the city, while her husband (Jon Snow) is the warden of the north to unify all of Westeros by having the king desired and the queen needed. (Plus I really hope Daenerys gets knocked up by Jon).
Realistic: Daenerys is probably going to die, most likely after she sees Kings Landing completely destroyed. I feel like she'll either die by the hands of someone she loves (Daario maybe?) or by her own hands after seeing that she really has nothing left to live for. However, Tyrion with the help of Sam and Bran learns that he is the remaining male Targaryen, with Jon not wanting the throne, and he becomes the King of Westeros and all those other titles.

$1 dollar bills? What kinda madness.
> travel a continent roughly the size of South America with ease?

It's pretty rare for one to go from Castle Black to Sunspear or vice versa. Most messages go much shorter distances.

> How do they know such precise locations, from the huge castles to the smallest holds?

Each generally only knows one home location. Then they're taken in cages along with other supplies in caravans, so that when they're released with a message elsewhere, they just fly that message home.

So you can only send a raven to the extent you have the right ones in your rookery for the destination. And I imagine ravens going to the smallest holds are mostly only kept at the castle directly above them in the hierarchy.

> How do they never seen to get lost, waylaid, or deterred?

They do. And in the story sometimes important messages are sent with multiple ravens or methods to make sure it gets through. There have also been mentions of archers shooting down outgoing ravens during a siege to prevent or intercept communications.

Though it hasn't really disrupted the story because that would just be an annoyance to the audience.

> Carrier pigeons couldn't pull this off

They work on the same principle. Definitely shorter range, though.

Its just something that we're supposed to sorta suspend out disbelief in. The birds in ASOIAF and GoT are more intelligent and learn quicker than most if not all birds in our real world.
The show does a bad job showing the Maester's jobs. The crows don't just fly from one place to the other. They stop at any castle or hold on their way and the Maester in charge there just check out where it's headed to and sends it on its way. Also they don't just send one bird. They send any where up to 5-100 depending on how many places they are sending a message to. And the crows are smart. It's a common thing in Westeros that crows talk. 
Not much opinions so far, it seems!? I'm a huge fan, but I'd say that roleplaying in Crowfall will be like roleplaying in EVE Online, unless one wants to focus on Eternal Kingdoms and build his own world - but then the question of resources and maintaining emerges.

The plan is laid out better in the books.  There he's also backing Aegon, and there is some evidence to suggest Aegon is actually the real person that Varys wants on the throne.  The plan was to use Dany as a backup and possibly a marriage option for Aegon.  The show appears to have cut out Aegon completely, so the way Varys handles Dany makes less sense on the screen.  Varys' role on the council is also meant to be playing both sides to keep his position of influence there secure.  He was informing in a way that didn't directly endanger Dany, and his reports of her helped to spread the word that she was coming, that a Targ was still alive. It allowed him to test the waters with that info to see how people responded, and how they might feel about Aegon too.  

The show also has Varys just up and abandon Kings Landing, with Qyburn taking control of Varys' Little Birds.  The books are quite different.  Varys just steps into the shadows and never loses contact with anyone.  He's still clearly in control of his network, and it's a surprise in the ADWD epilogue when Varys and his Birds appear and kill Kevan.  The show version is greatly simplified, which is probably helpful since the show runners want to shorten the ending, but it does make Varys look weak when he should be completely in control of everything.  It's similar how show Varys is a lot more likable and nice, but book Varys is all calculating mastermind, and if anything Varys appears to be in a much better position by the end of ADWD than Littlefinger for having his plans come together.

The assassin was sent out when Viserys was still alive. 
I like to think that Varys sent a clumsy assassin (you saw how the wine seller was way too eager and jumpy) on purpose who would fail anyway
Daenerys wasn't the heir during that conversation. Viserys was and was still alive when the assassin was sent. Daenerys's assassination would've spurred Drogo to help Viserys invade, he otherwise wasn't moving. 

It's weird how often people forget that Viserys existed. Like all the threads about Targaryens being fireproof that disregard that Viserys burned. Poor Harry Lloyd.
You have to take into account that there is discarded story lines now.In the books the plan looks to have been to marry Viserys to arriane martell who is not in the show to get the dornish to back house targ.Marry dany to drogo for 20k dothraki,and for aegon to land with the golden company backing him.Plus any other houses still loyal to house targ.
I really can't notice the wig everybody's talking about, maybe it's because I'm just waking up. 

On the other hand, seeing Arya surrounded by snow is amazing. I really hope we have another family reunion this season. 
I came here looking for a complete dissection of these stills.  Can we please get to work?  I need colored arrows and theory crafting.
Seriously, I don't understand the negative comments for Sophie's wig. HBO is getting really good in teasing us GOT fans.
I think that's Arya outside of Winterfell and I want to cry just thinking about it   
that site is experiencing some pretty heavy hug of death
Can we get an imgur mirror for these photos? This site has been hugged to death
Sansaaaa ♥♥
In these screencaps Sansa reminds me of Catelyn while Arya reminds me of Ned :( 
Sansa looks so off... I don't know what it is.
Anyone got video for this?
[The video](https://twitter.com/sansaerysnow/status/803282823847219204/video/1)
My girl Arya looking good. Hope she gets to the family reunion before everyone gets beheaded or sth
Calling it, Arya frees her Uncle and goes on to the North. Jon gets his sister's (cousins) uncle as a guest and presses his claim on a river lands divided by a Frey family so fucking big everyone is coming out of the woodwork to claim a piece. 
I feel like the Arya picture is from either late in the season when she returns to Winterfell, or she is actually with the Brotherhood Without Banners, following them as they head north to prepare for The Long Night/War for Dawn. Nothing to do with these pictures, but I think Melisandre will end up with the BwB, too. The storylines are all converging as the end game begins, and most places have multiple major characters in them. The only exceptions are Sam at Oldtown, Arya in the Riverlands, and Bran North of the wall. By the end of season seven, these characters will have to be set up for their end game and their final allegiances in place; it would seem a Stark reunion has to happen soon. I mean, the original title for the last book was "A Time for Wolves"....
Was Sophies braid from S6 her real hair?

That braid was the shit.
Arya shot looks sick. Leaving as a kid, comming home a badass.
I can't tell she's wearing a wig, I guess I'm lucky.   What's throwing you guys off, the color?  Or it doesn't look like a real head of hair to you?

Hmm teasers already. I wonder how close it is to releasing.
That has to be Arya within sight of Winterfell. 

Oh, the feels. 
Are these images (or whatever it is) hosted anywhere on a site that will actually load?
woo, do you think its some early Superbowl trailer? 
Sansa in front of a weirwood, maybe went north to find bran?
I am not looking forward to S7. S6 had so many good 'payoffs' as someone put it, S7 is going to go right back to tragedy. Cant they bring the story together without killing off any more protagonists?  Is that why grrm made so many starks? Sword fodder? 
Boy i hope that is Arya riding in Winterfell
[removed]
Got to put it out there since Westworld has one episode left...
Oh god the sansa wig is completely off putting. :/
why is the sansa picture the only one in HD???? the arya and jon pics are the ones we all want to see XD
Was that explosion from GoT? Because I'm thinking Ice Dragon if so.
She wouldn't have known he was alive, and does she even care that much?

Old Nan looks like Gollum.
Why does old nan look like [Sebulba](http://imgur.com/O25J7Kn)?

I love the addition of Varys being very shiny.
These are great!

It's refreshing to see some GoT illustration that is less 'high-fantasy'ish - I really like the style of these. Reminds me of Quentin Blake, maybe a touch of *The Edge Chronicles* too.

What a great idea! Keep it up!
Who's Moreo Tumitis?  Did you mean Ilyrio Mopatis?
I'm sorry but l laughed so hard at old nan 
These are wonderful!
This is the first that I've seen Tommen look how he is described in the books.  Fat, soft, curly haired child.  Awesome work.  Seems like a good way to keep track of all the characters as you go through as well

Damn.. season 7 really needs to start
There is a reason Gilly of Craster's Keep is part of the story other than a plot device for Sam. It kind of seems like she's just along for the ride but it always seemed like she had a further purpose as well. And the baby has something to do with it too. Some crucial moment will involve her and it will be a big one. I think. personally.
You had me at first because your bit about Craster being the White Walker father actually makes sense.

And, as we all know of course, every single wight is actually Arya using a faceless man disguise. She's also going to be a secret Blackfyre, it is known.
Jon's dad is targaryen? 
Wait wait wait..... Sam's mom is Stannis' wife's sister? 

SAM IS STANNIS' NEPHEW BY LAW? 

When was this mentioned?
Bran is the Night King 

I think a lot of us already assume that the Night King is a Stark though.
Well to be fair GRRM hasn't killed Hodor...yet. 
I bet Hodor and Samwell would have been best buddies if fate had not torn Hodor asunder before the meeting.
The thing that made it hard for me was that Hodor, was the one of the only characters that didn't have an agender. 

His only point in his life was to protect Bran and ofc "hold the door" 
Not only didn't GRRM kill him yet, but I didn't think he was a great character in the books.  He didn't stand out to me.  The show made him more memorable mostly because TV/Movies are a different medium than books.  Characters get developed differently.

That said, even in the show I wasn't a big fan.  Maybe I've just seen waaaaay too many shows/movies and the big lug character was meant for me.

Hodor!
> Hodor was probably the most lovable, good natured character ever. 

Perfect reason to kill him off. No one is safe, not even the guys who can only say one word.
Hello, welcome to Game of Thrones. 
Wasn't that one of the reasons he was able to become the new king? I'm pretty sure he was well-aware...
It is known.
**THANK THE GODS FOR RHAELLE TARGARYEN AND HER TITS!!I**
That's why he could usurp the throne

Kind of a oxymoron, the whole idea.
Why would the brotherhood without banners have a banner? Do a forked lightning bolt purple on black.

Figuring out a gift for a friend who also loves GoT. I've had some sneaky discussions and if she lived in Westeres she would either be with House Martell or the Brotherhood Without Banners.
The Brotherhood has a nice emblem which I could make, however I cannot find any references in the series (which makes sense, considering the name). Pictured emblem is from the wiki. 

So I'm looking for any reference for the emblem, any help?
You know the banner of their leader, depending on how advanced you are in the show or books
Context: Badminton is the main winter sport where I am from. We basically play it only during the winter. 
Nice art

And then those enemies reveal they are running away from 
I know you're probably joking, but can you imagine it being true? it'd be like DBZ with the way the threat is forced to escalate,  

"But the last villain could destroy cities in the blink of an eye! how can this one be stronger?" 

"They can blow up planets!"  

"FUCK!" 



"Okay. we beat Mr 'fuck your planet in particular'  we're done!" 

"This next one can destroy Solar Systems!"

"Fuck this, I'm out."
If the Others/WW were "designed" to wipe out mankind, thats what they're gonna do. But they can only do so with winter, and the long night is coming.

The real question is why are they waiting till now. Simply because there is a long night of winter coming?

But I doubt there is a bigger badder enemy the WW are running from. The better theory is that they are actually the good guys some how. lol
As the final credits roll, the first name on screen will be M. Night 
This is unlikely. If you're referring to the event that destroyed Valyria, it is rumored that the Valyrians destroyed themselves. The doom that befell them was of their own making and a long time coming for the atrocities they committed in the name of their civilization. The others are merely a killing and assimilation machine created by the first children to defeat men. 
Kit Harrington wakes up in bed with Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams and says " I just had the craziest dream". 
The other Others?
The grumkins and snarks.
Theyre looking for the center of the maze... L+R=MiB confirmed, White Walkers = Maeve's army, Logan = Hand of the King... or something like that
The Deep Ones 
The White Walkers are running from Westerosis who are running from White Walkers who are running from Westerosis who are
What greater unnamed enemy?

I'd say that he'd swear himself to House Stark and take on the role he had with Joffrey except with the Starks. I mean Bran's gonna need a new big fucker to carry him around now and he already served as a protector for Sansa (kinda) and Arya. 

If CleganeBowl does happen it's not gonna end well for him. The Mountain doesn't feel any thing and Sandor's got a limp now. 
My theory is that he, along with some other conflicted characters (my money's on Jorah or Brienne) will join the Brotherhood, who will then join up with Jon to create a defense against the White Walkers
I definitely think he's gonna join the brotherhood, and meet up with the stark crew again in S7. That could lead to conflict with arya cause she hates them, but I hope they get along cause he's my favourite character too (along with jon) and I loved their little duo, going around and fuckin shit up. 

And of course, 
Get Hype.
Part of me believes that he could end up being Azor Ahai/Prince that was promised. The emphasis on his fear of fire seems like a foreshadow that he has to overcome said fear. Wielding Lightbringer would be poetic in that context, and with all of the different people telling him that the gods still have a plan for him, it's possible he can be the one to defeat the walkers. While I'm skeptical that GRRM would make the Hound the hero of the whole series, I feel like it's still a possibility and one that I would very much enjoy.
In my opinion I think that any carrier of Valyrian Steel will have a part in slaying a white walker, with Widow's Wail and Heartsbane not currently being used I believe he will acquire either one of them or his own sword or even Dragon-Glass.

i hope he will somehow end up helping sansa, but i fear they will waste him in a useless fanservice aka cleganebowl...
Cleganebowl will happen, Cersei will think he's the Valonqar but he will die fighting his brother or in wildfire with him. Cersei will think she is victorious, then Jaime will kill her as he is really the Valonqar/younger brother.
I know I'm late to the party but I really think (hope) that he's gonna kill littlefinger. I agree with alot of you that he'll end up serving the starks, or at least interact with them a lot as a BWB. But I really think he's a contender for Baelishslayer. We know that he's always been protective over Sansa, also he's spent enough time in Kings Landing to know that he's a scumbag. If Jon wants Littlefinger to die he'll do it himself, so maybe The Hound will find out what he's done not just to Sansa, but all of Westeros and just straight up murder that fool. Fingers crossed.

Edit: also Littlefinger is a talker, and we all know how Sandor feels about talkers
I'm just putting this here for the "sansan" fans that in the second season in one of the commentaries that David and Dan said they will explore that story in a later season. I doubt they would even mention it unless it had some truth to it so who knows. (Btw I absolutely hate the term sansan)
The Hound joins the Brotherhood without Banners. They head north to the Wall lead by Dendric and Thoras. They run into Melisandre coming south. Arya runs into Nymeria and they run into the rest. Then Brienne and Pod, escaped from Riverrun show up. The Hound is still a little upset about being abandoned to die and about being beaten by Brienne. Arya has Dendric, Thoras, Melisandre and the Hound on her list. Brienne is still insistent about taking Arya back to Winterfell. They work things out with some shouting and maybe a few blows, then Arya, Nymeria, Thoras, Dendric, Brienne and Pod head for Winterfell. They all meet Sansa, who's in charge, while Jon is in the South with Davos at Dragonstone meeting the Mother of Dragons. Melisandre heads south to King's Landing, where she runs into Davos, Tyrion and Gendry. Thoras, Dendric and the Hound head for Castle Black to reinforce the Night's Watch. They fight the wights and WWs when the Wall comes down. Dendric and the Hound die, but Thoras brings the Hound back, only to die from the effort. Delorous Ed also gets killed and the Hound, Ser Sandor Clegane, becomes the Lord Commander.
Perhaps to differentiate him from the Nights Watch as they're called Crows.

Apparently though, theories with strong evidence support that the 3ER was from the Night's Watch and therefore was a "crow". The third eye representing "omniscient abilities" yet still fighting for what the Night's Watch stands for and therefore a crow. That's just a maybe that I wrote up on the spot.

From what I can tell from our world's cultures, ravens are generally more "respected" or "admired" than crows as well as considered more exotic than crows. Not to mention Poe's The Raven.
They did it to distinguish between book character and show character. Book TEC is Brynden Rivers, around 150 years old, a targ great bastard, banished hand of the king, valerian steel sword carrying badass.

TER is sort of a mashup of him, allegedly 1k years old if we take him literally, and likely without any of the aforementioned backstory that would be too cumbersome to tell on television, and would distract from Bran's plot line moving along. Also, the crow/Raven confusion was mentioned by D&D at some point.

I would consider it a similar move to them calling show coldhands "benjen coldhands" to differentiate from book coldhands which according to GRRMs manuscript, is not benjen. 

Edit: my phone autocorrected Brynden to Brunson lmao

That is just a toga party with wigs.
Is that a Qartheen dress on the left I see?
None of you are dressed as 'Khaleesi'. You're dressed as Daenerys of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals(, the Rhoynar) and the First Men, Lady Regnant of the Seven Kingdoms, **Khaleesi** of the Great Grass Sea, Mhysa, Breaker of Chains, the Unburnt, Mother of Dragons.

Or Dany for short. 


Her name isn't Khaleesi you fucking gremlin. 
Khaleesi is basically "queen" in dothraki. Her name is Daenerys and she is a Khaleesi
stuffed animal dragons in the straps?!
"All the freshman dressed as Khaleesi..."

Eagerly click on link....only to be disappointed.  
What school/team? 
That nip slip, front right O_O
Her name is Daenerys

There's no solid evidence in the shows (yet) but I have a feeling he knows but can't say anything because that would reveal how he knew Lyanna wasn't kidnapped because he started that rumor to get back at Brandon Stark for nearly killing him and stealing Cat.
He certainly doesn't believe that Rhaegar kidnapped and raped Lyanna.  It is speculation that he doesn't believe Ned betrayed Cat, but his reaction in [this scene](https://youtu.be/Bfnl9owFc84?t=132) evidences that Petyr knows more than he admits.
It's all inferences and knowing looks. I think he knows that the Baratheon story isn't the whole story and is too clever to simply believe that Ned "lost his honor" while in the south.
I think LF knows the "official" story of Rhaegar and Lyanna isn't true. I doubt if he knows about Jon. I mean the inferences are certainly there to those that know. But if Robert didn't suspect and Varys didn't know, I doubt LF knows. Certainly the only people left alive that know the WHOLE truth are the two maids that served Lyanna in the ToJ. Yet after fifteen years, not a whisper. Ned went to the crypt with his secret intact. 
No, he or Varys don't know
Littlefinger is bright. I imagine he at least suspects Lyanna wasn't kidnapped. It's hard to say if he has put the pieces together on Jon. He's smart enough to know Ned was too honorable to be unfaithful to his wife, but his hatred of the Starks could make him believe Ned wasn't as honorable as he seemed. 
No
I don't think he "knows" but out of everyone in Westeros I think he's the one most likely to reckon (correctly) that Robert's story of Lyanna's kidnap and rape is not actually true. 

He probably has suspicions but there would be no way to prove them, and what would he, personally, gain if he did?

Even if he knew, even if he had undeniable proof, he's not likely to share that information with anyone unless it puts him on the throne or in some other way grants him a major boon.

I doubt it LF knows. If he knew that information he would have used it to put a wedge between Ned and King Robert. 
I think he knows nature of Rhagar and Lyanna relationship - it wasn't kidnapping or rape but mutual love or at least affection. She was known to be tough she-Wolf. Tourney of Harrenhal and LF was there. Might have saw them.

Beyond that? Don't think so but people speculate about about it because it is LF sneaky creepy guy.
Most probably.
I think it is entirely possible that Petyr or Varys could figure it out. More so Petyr since he was "closer" to the Stark family.
[deleted]
No. Unless he is also Howland Reed, which is impossible as he died in S6E10
It was said that Cersei made up the story of her firstborn black haired child just in order to comfort Catelyn. He never existed
I get that she had a child to Robert, but isn't part of the prophecy "gold will be their crowns" meaning golden hair.. The three children Joff, Myrcella and Tommen with golden crowns all die.

Wildlings only really become a true threat when they unite under a King which has happened 6 times. Other than that they're just a nuisance. I suppose as evidence of "The Others" existance dwindled down to pretty much no more than stories and the Wildlings were actually tangeable threats people just started to view the Wall as having a different purpose. This is summed up perfectly by Sam though:

> We didn't build a wall 600 feet high to keep men out
Presumably sometime after the Andal invasion, when the Children of the Forest were eradicated, so couldn't remind men, where the First Men were looked upon now with disdain (largely, it settled after the war but Andal-First Men tension was still there), so the wildlings could be viewed as savages, and long enough so that the Long Night was far removed from memory, and the horrors of the Andal Invasion supplanting it. Now you have massive wall manned by foreigners who've never seen it, so they're initial explanation must be that it is these violent savages who cross the Wall to raid and steal who we must fight. After a while, no one really thinks about it, and it is presumed as fact. Keep in mind a lot of records about the Others and the Long Night were presumably lost when the Old Tongue of the First Men was supplanted by the Common Tongue of the Andals as the dominant language of Westeros 
Well after many years most of Westeros began to believe the The Wall was built to keep the wildlings out. Even though The nights watch knew that it was built to keep the Others out, they haven't been seen in thousands of years. So they also began to focuse on keeping wildlings out. 
No one south of The Wall has seen The Others for a long time so they just faded into myth. The northmen fight the wildlings because they keep coming from the other side for raids and stuff.

It has been 8000 years the White Walkers/Others were last seen. 

That is about twice as long as Judaism has been around, four times as long as Christianity has been around, and almost five times as long as Islam has been around. 

Just to put it in perspective as to how it might have lost its original meaning.
Keep in mind the Nights Watch has their own histories.  There were thousands of books at Castle Black.

One of the parts of lore that they no doubt knew well was the 13th Lord Commander known only as The Night's King.  This would've been soon after the Wall was erected.  The Lord Commander found a woman with blue eyes and skin white as the moon but cold as ice.  He took her to the Nightfort (then the base of the Nights Watch) and for 13 years ruled over the Wall and the Brotherhood, making sacrifices to the White Walkers.  Joramun, the King Beyond the Wall, and the Stark King of the North banded together to overthrow him (it was then that Joramun sounded the Horn of Winter and raised the giants).  After they found evidence of his sacrifices, his name was stricken from all records, and the tradition of Nights Watch castles not having southern walls and eschewing all crowns or politics was born.

So the Nights Watch definitely knows this story, and they know the wildlings were definitely not why the Wall was created.  The free folk were likely just people who lived past the Wall in the beginning (and were still actively fighting White Walkers and other remnants), and people like Mance Rayder who didn't like the kings South of the Wall.  However, the Nights Watch is a pale shadow of what it once was.  Through time, worse recruits, and the conquest of the Andals, likely the rank and file became more worried about the murderous thieves that attack them and raid the Gift.  Likely there was some knowledge of what was happening that rested in people like Benjen Stark, Jeor Mormont, Maester Aemon, ex-Watch like Mance, or people related to the Watch like Craster.  But the general policy was much more practical in light of the thousands of years that the supernatural threats had been hidden away.

That looks nothing like Casterly Rock is described. [This is Casterly Rock](http://i.picpar.com/To9.jpg)
Too pretty and tropical, should be a great standalone work rather than associated with casterly Rock 
Nothing about this says Casterly Rock. Sorry to the artist, but covering it in clouds is a bit of a cop out as well. It's just a castle and some tropical forest and water. You could tell me this is a castle from any generic fantasy. 
I hope we get to thoroughly see it at some point in the show!
I think the rock is actually described to be much less luxurious, more practical for defence etc.
Thats so pretty! But I think I little too ornate for Casterly rock, It's supposed to be carved stone I believe
[removed]
Looks tropical almost

Ehhh... I guess its sorta cute. I'd buy it for a girlfriend or girl friend.


Most people in Westeros still don't believe the walkers are real. Only the northerners, NW and some followers of the Lord of Light know what's coming.
Dany doesn't control anywhere close to most of Essos.  She really only has the three cities and a bunch of grasslands and wastelands.  There are still the free cities like Bravos as well as the cities in the east like Qarth, Asshai, etc. 

Plus, moving everyone from Westeros to Essos is not physically possible.  There would be nowhere near enough ships.  That's like if we tried to move the population of the US to Europe.  It isn't feasible at all. 
IIRC, Essos too suffers from generations long winters and fortifications (the Five Forts) were built on the far side of the Grass Sea to the north-east across from the Grey Waste to block the "demons of the Lion of the Night" and are now manned by troops from the "Golden" Empire of the Yi Ti to guard against raiders (sound familiar?).
Property is wealth. If you own land in Westeros, why would you want to give that up for a place you have no attachment to? You'd have no land, no real estate, and no control over natural resources. 

If you're poor, you wouldn't be able to afford it. Or rather, you'd be taking a gamble that you could improve your standard of living in a foreign land among strange people with vastly different customs--if you managed to avoid being sold into slavery. 

You would need a significant incentive to uproot your entire way of life. Avoiding the zombie apocalypse would qualify in my book, but nobody believes the White Walkers are anything more than a myth.

so many people trying to make a break for some ports and limited amount of ships, would likely cause a higher causality rate
With much of Essos being barren deserts it would seem that resources are already mostly depleted.  It's pretty obvious to me Essos is meant to be a lot like Africa, if millions or even hundreds of thousands moved there from Westeros it would seem that they couldn't sustain life very long.
And how would they get there? Do you understand the large logistics challenge that it requires?
Because then we wouldn't have a plot line 
I'm sorry but this is a stupid question... Is it a joke?

Why don't the Mexico just move to the US?

If the cartels and corrupt government get out of hand they'll just kill everyone south of border. Even if we have Mexican/Latin politicians here, doesn't mean there is room for everyone to come immediately or at all.

For perspective.
Who?

If you are outnumbered and also face a ruthless enemy that will rain arrows on you all the time no matter whether his own soldiers could be hit, you don't really want to fight on an open field like they did. That i guess is the reason they were standing on the border to a (small) forest. The best thing that could happen is the Boltons charging at them and while doing so, retreat to the trees. You are protected from the arrows and it takes some speed out of charging cavalry as they have to manouver around the trees. 

Inbetween the trees, it is also much easier to deny certain formations like they did with the big shields and spears. They have to adjust the formation everytime they pass a tree and this can give you a momentum to break them. 

If that wasn't their plan, there is pretty much no big difference to what happened in the episode. If you are highly outnumbered, there is not much you can do on an open field. 
The show strategy for Jon was horrendous though.And it was obvious by the layout that it would never happen.The smartest thing would of been to use Guerrilla war tactics,or if they were absolutely going to have 1 single battle then they should of incorporated the frozen lake trick from the books.
He was fucked as soon as he left the gates due to the Vale showing up.
I've [previously](http://imgur.com/a/1iOMi) given my analysis of the battle and the reasons why it had to happen and why both sides had terrible strategies. What I never got around to was a suggestion for an alternative strategy that could have been used. I'm planning on doing so in detail in the near future, so here's a summary of what I think Jon should have done.

1) Jon should have pushed his lines forward so that his archers were on top of the two rises and his infantry in the gap between them. This not only allows his archers to see the enemy, but gives them a range advantage, which they'll likely need due to how many of them have non-military bows. 

2) in front and to the sides of his position, Jon should have erected some kind of barricade. Perhaps this would take the form of a series of stakes or, if the ground was too hard, perhaps three of those stakes lashed together to form a barricade. If possible, hidden trenches or potholes forward of the barricade.

3) the men in the front of his ranks should have large wicker shields covered in leather, layers of linen or rawhide in order to protect them from Ramsay's arrows. The soldiers behind should have been armed with long stakes, preferably pikes.

4) Jon's cavalry and Wun Wun (who has a club) should have been in the woods on either side of his position, ready to spring an ambush. Reading through both medieval and 19th century accounts, it becomes clear that surprise charges routinely rout much larger forces, if only temporarily.

**How the battle plays out**

Due to his defences, Jon never manages to charge out to save Rickon. Davos and Sansa have time to catch him and bring him back into line, but only after Jon nearly kills Davos and threatens his men in an attempt to get through them more quickly. Ramsay is disappointed and kills Rickon in front of the whole army.

Impatient, Ramsey sends his cavalry in next, but they're brought up short by Jon's defences and begin to lose men and horses to his archers. At a signal from Davos, Jon still being worked up, a hundred and fifty cavalry riding knee to knee come from the right and fifty cavalry and Wun Wun come in close formation from the right. The Bolton cavalry, disorganised because of their failed charge and the large number of them compared to Jon's force and having formed a roiling sea of men and horses, are unable to react in time and, after the first shock, rout. They're brought back under control eventually, but Ramsay sends his archers and infantry into battle out of disgust.

The archers advance forward of the Bolton heavy infantry. Smalljon and Lord Karstark have yet to be seen, and Ramsay gives a little smirk.

Ramsay's archers enter into a duel with Jon's and take a disproportionate number of casualties due to Jon's use of shields and the elevation of his archers. They do, however, cause a large number of casualties on Jon's side before they retreat and the pikemen advance.

Under cover of a line of brave shield bearers and a few archers, the ditch is filled with corpses and the infantry advances, the shield bearers tearing down the barricades and begining to engage with Jon's pikemen, who are not particularly good.

A Wildling suddenly runs up to Jon and tells him that there are enemies behind him. Jon manages to form the dismounted cavalry, who rejoined him after their charge, into a defensive line just before Lord Karstark and Smalljon bring their light infantry into play, attacking from the woods. Jon finds himself pressed from front and rear and his situation appears hopeless. He realises that he can't see Sansa and panics.

A sound like thunder has been in the background for a while now, but it's only just now fully audible to us and to Jon, who gets clear of the battle line and looks towards where the Bolton cavalry should be, irrationally fearing a charge. Instead, he is in time to see the Knights of the Vale hit Ramsay's barely formed cavalry, lances lowered. Another detachment of Littlefinger's cavalry comes into view around the rise to Jon's left and, trumpets sounding, hit Ramsay's heavy infantry in the rear. The infantry has tried to reform to meet the charge, but are unable to fully meet it, and the KotV have peytrals, which largely protect their horses. The Bolton heavy infantry rout from their left, free up Jon's remaining infantry to focus on Smalljon and Karstark.

Jon, meanwhile, mounts one of the few surviving horses, with a combination of archers and men at arms and has Wun Wun clear a path for them. Someone hands him Stark banner and he charges towards Winterfell, Wun Wun in the lead.

Now, through all this, Wun Wun has had a massive shield on his back, made from split saplings and covered in leather or rawhide. He unslings it now as he charges Winterfell. It stops the first springald bolt, which penetrates a foot. The second nearly penetrates all the way through and the third actually manages to injure Wun Wun. The Bolton archers are shooting at him now. The fourth and final bolt pins Wun Wun's shield to his body, but in one last effort he shoulder charges the gate, which breaks open, and stumbles into the courtyard beyond, still being shot at by archers.

Things then proceed much the same as they did in the show, only with a small but reasonable sized group of archers and men at arms following Jon into Winterfell, followed by a large group of KotV, lead by Sansa and Littlefinger.

Both Ramsay and Jon are thus competent generals, both make mistakes true to their character, and a minimal suspension of disbelief is required.
Jon should have sent 50-100 archers through the secret winterfell tunnel maester lewin told theon about. The archers could mount winterfell's battlements and shoot Ramsay's forces from behind
Step 1. Give Wun-Wun a bow and have him shoot from outside of the range of the defending archers. 

Step 2. ???

Step 3. Profit! 
I suppose in theory holding back, letting Jon die and allowing Ramsay to chase them down would have led to likely less overall casualties since Sansa and the Vale still would've been able to surprise them. In reality watching your commander be pathetically slain by a charging cavalry probably would've been a devastating hit to morale because just like that the wildling insurance policy is gone. I mean I guess at this point they're *technically* fighting for Sansa's claim but Jon had proven a regard towards them and inspired them in ways that she never could.
I love that episode but I hate that battle. For the life of me, I cannot understand how everyone forgot the Stark army had a giant... Jon, Tormund and every wildling there saw Mance use Giants with huge bows and wooly mammoths!

They should've been building defensive/offensive weaponry for a Giant the moment he walked through the doors at Castle Black. 

Jon and his army could've attacked at night instead of waiting for the morning. With a broad shield of sorts, a giant could approach the gates of Winterfell at night and bust the door down. Even if you fought in the morning, in an open field the Giant could be launching bolts all the way across the battle field to force the Boltons to charge.

Not fucking besiege a castle that's known for it's good defenses (500 men can defend Winterfell against 10,000) and has twice as many men as you in the first place.
Ok lemme just talk about Ramsay's plan.

Step 1: Kill Rickon, Get Jon's forces to charge him.

Step 2: Cavalry charge.

Step 3: Kill enough men with archers to create giant walls of bodies.

Step 4: Surround with Phalanx formation to kill survivors. 

Ramsay should have been able to completely wipe the floor before the Knights of the Vale even showed up if he was  at all a competent military leader. He managed to get Jon to leave his defensive, advantageous position. However, instead of capitalizing on this, he instead wastes nearly half his army. After Jon's idiotic charge all Ramsay would have to do is move up a line of pikeman and slaughter the inferior, weak loyalist cavalry. Jon's infantry would meet a similar fate by charging at the Bolton lines.

Ramsay should have been able to win this losing maybe a thousand soldiers if that. Jon may have been a dumbass in this battle, but Ramsay blew his huge lead. 
They should've stayed put. Rally around Sansa who is the trueborn Stark and their rallying point going forward after Jon would've died. They played into the trap. Obvi it worked out but realistically what they did would've killed them all without the Vale
Honestly, Jon should have put his pride down. Sansa was right, Ramsey was better at games. Jon should have never ran for his brother. Jon should have walked away. Ramsey might still have killed his brother, but he might have just taken him back inside. Jon rushing in to save him is what really screwed them over. Realistically, they should not have chased after Jon either. The problem is with those battles most people were lost with out the guy in charge.
What are you smoking??? It is one thing to argue Ned is the father while Lyanna is the mother. But evidence in the final episode of season 6 tells us who the father was without saying his name. Re-watch the scene again. Also, there are evidence when Lyanna whispers to Ned "if Robert finds out" he will kill Jon....who is a targ....Robert wants to kill every living targ, so they can't claim the thorn again. Season 6, was about Lyanna. Season 7, we will get Rheagar a little bit. Also, we will see a flashback of them both. Jon is the most important character in this story. He is The Prince That was Promised and Azor Ahai Reborn. 
A+ for creativity but lets not wander too far into the Godswood

I'm not sure what you're getting at.

FTFY. Nothing in the show about Raeghar being Jon Snow's dad. Ned Stark is the father as per S1E1. Lyanna was confirmed as the mother last season. Ned + Lyanna = Jon Snow. You're welcome.

The white wolf. It's badass, references ghost, fits with the fact that he has felt like an outcast his whole life, and it reflects the fact that he is half stark and half targaryen. So much meaning in such a simple nickname
Jon Snow, the Reborn, King of the North and the Freefolk, The White Wolf, Saver of the Freefolk, Slayer of Ice Demons, 998th Commander of the Nights Watch, True Protector of His Friends and the Outcast, and Knower of Nothing.
White Wolf is so badass I wish it was my nickname 
If none of the Wildlings call him King Crow I will call the banners and lay siege to D&D's mansions. 
Kinda like how Daenerys has her long title I'd like to see Davos do something similiar in response to say when Misande introduces Daenerys.

 "Hero to the free folk, The undying, 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, The Commander we turned to when the night was darkest, The White Wolf, The Prince that was Promised, The King in the North"
I personally like:

Jon Stark Lord of Winterfell and King in the North.  I love the nickname "The White Wolf" but don't think it should be in his list of titles.
He is the 'Song of Ice and Fire'
People mentioned **"The White Wolf"** and other cool nicknames or titles. I like **"King Crow."** I might have deeper meaning than some people might think. 

Who read the books and knows about Mormont's raven (likely saying things on Bloodraven's orders as theory says.) He called Jon *"King",* *"Corn Corn King Snow Jon Snow."* When Jeor offered Jon his ancestrial sword Longclaw for saving him from a wight, and Jon hesitated, for a sec raven yelled *"Take it, take it."*  When wight attacks them, he said *"Burn, burn, burn."* 

Show went a different route in these scenes. If he acted on Bloodraven's orders, as we know he's a warg. Also, that Blodraven send them direwolves to the Stark kids and took especially interest in Jon and Bran because of their destiny. Jon being a half Stark, Targ, a prophetic hero, Bran is his replacement and powerful greenseer, warg. Bloodraven also known as Brynden Rivers was a Targ bastard, and LC of Night's Watch at some point. Some parallels with Jon as a character.

I'd like to think, it might be a nod from the show to these things from the books. Raven telling us who Jon is or will be. 
Jahaerys Targaryen
Joe Crow
" king crow" from hardhome episode.

Jaehaerys Targaryan? /s well "Wildling lover" is my favorite!
King Crow is the best
When he finally rides a dragon he will become Stringfellow Hawke.
Jon Snow, the Black Dragon

Not really my favorite but I do like it... But its gonna get shat on if R+L was a "legal" marriage.
Jon Snow - "The White Wolf" 
Ptobably Lord Commander or White Wolf.
Other then the official ones like white wolf, lord snow and off course DAKINDINDANORF, i really like King crow. 
Now that we know he's a Targaryen and a Stark I think "The Dragon Wolf" would be a so badass name for him.
The bastard. It has always been my favorite curse word.
Cornelius. 
YOU'LL REFER TO HIM AS YER GRASE!
Lord Snow as it was originally used by Ser Alliser to mock Jon. Then he took that name and made it his own.
Jon has some cool titles and nicknames, but contrary to some people who are excited about him having a long official style, I think Jon would prefer to keep things simple and avoid flair.  

It's part of the appeal of his character, especially having been raised as a bastard and an outsider, that he doesn't "look in" to established Westerosi politics with longing. Tyrion told him to embrace his outsider status because it will give him strength, and he's done that, and he'll continue to do that.  

If he gets an official Davos red-carpet introduction at all, I suspect it will be something to the tune of "Jon Snow, King in the North."

If you think your mom has never had semen dripping down her chin you're very mistaken.
I don't think you're being elitist about people who can't stomach the show, but you are being a bit patronising about moms.  If she liked season 1 she knows what to expect. 
If she enjoyed season one im sure she will like all the others
She wouldn't have asked if she didn't want to see it, so go ahead. She's surely capable of making up her own mind, and the series isn't bad enough to give nightmares even though it's a bit stomach-churning in parts.
Dude, in the very first episode of season 1 there were two creepy brother/sister incest scenes. If that didn't throw her off, Craster's implied father/daughter thing won't either. Besides, it sounds like she's already invested anyways, so I'd say just go with it.

Well my Mom loves the books after I convinced her to read them and they're just as bad, if not worse, than the show so I'd say lend her season 2. If not she'll likely go and waste money on buying the blu-ray herself so...
Your mom is a grown adult woman.  I think she can decide what she wants to watch, she tells you she wants to see it then take her at her word and hand over season 2.  She can figure it out from there.
Benjen sacrificed his life to serve. Jon hadn't even taken his vows yet, how could he reasonably be mad at Benjen. His uncle had repeatedly told him not to join. Stark men don't complain. I doubt benjen said the watch was amazing but he wouldn't complain either. 

He was more angry with Ned. However, he also feels neglected by Benjen. He is too busy to interact with him much, until he says goodbye to range North of the Wall. 

> No one had told him the Night's Watch would be like this; no one except Tyrion Lannister. The dwarf had given him the truth on the road north, but by then it had been too late. **Jon wondered if his father had known what the Wall would be like. He must have, he thought; that only made it hurt the worse.**
**Even his uncle had abandoned him in this cold place at the end of the world.** Up here, the genial Benjen Stark he had known became a different person. He was First Ranger, and he spent his days and nights with Lord Commander Mormont and Maester Aemon and the other high officers, while Jon was given over to the less than tender charge of Ser Alliser Thorne.


What I always wondered, if he hated it so much, why didn't he left before he took his vows? Honor and things or what?

i think he disapeard at that time, so he was more worry than upset about him

Pretty good, but I think the Smith has to be Tyrion. Besides the Hephaestus in Greek Myth parallels (he's deformed, beautiful and cheating love interests), he also builds or commands others to build things when he rules over Kings Landing. Most importantly though, his personality is wanting to fix things and set things right, like a blacksmith.
This is pretty good thinking. So far every religion has shown some sort of magical aspect of existing in the real-world except for the faith of the seven. 

The Many Faced God, the Red God, the Old Gods, etc all have followers capable of magic. 

Your theory would explain why the faith of the seven doesn't have any. 

To the best of my recollection, the faith of the seven was brought to Westeros from Andalos in Essos. You just need to find a reason for Bran to influence the Andals before they came to Westeros and your theory will be complete. 

> the stranger represents death and depicted in a number of different forms, **sometimes having no face at all**, I’m not even gonna say it.

Oberyn is the stranger? 
That's quite an interesting and nice idea. Maybe you could present it to /r/pureasoiaf, if there is anything wrong with it they'll tell you, here people didn't have necessarily read the books. There, they'll tell you why it is or not possible :).

Edit : typo++.
I've read a similar post about this on this sub and they say that the "Seven" are the Starks. Think about it: Ned, Tully, Sansa, Robb, Bran, Rickon, Arya, And Jon. 

The Stark Children similar personalities in The Light Of The Seven. Not sure about this too but the idea that it could be someone messing with their religion is plausible. It may or may not be them but it's certainly someone real and someone we've known in the series. 

Edit: Jon is half-Stark so that makes them 7. For all we know he could be the one helping Sam write the story in the future. 
im assuming that you mean arya is the stranger
Danerarys fertility and childbirth? that doesnt seem to add up.

bur aside from that, cool theory.
I think I have seen a very similar theory here before and I am a pretty big fan of it actually. I don't think we'll ever get it confirmed or busted by the show, but it's fun thinking about the characters in this way.
It's an interesting possibility. I think some of the characters clearly embody aspects of the seven. I wrote a post about it a few months back:

I think one of the things GRRM is doing is lining characters up to represent the Seven gods - the Father, the Mother, the Maiden, the Crone, the Warrior, the Smith, and the Stranger. Some of these have strong alignments to characters that I think have been strongly suggested, others I am not so sure. The match does not need to be perfect, Daenerys isn't all that merciful but then nor is the Mother's Mercy.

The Mother - mercy, peace, fertility, and childbirth. Daenerys. She is the Mother of Dragons and her followers call her mother. Her character arc has been concerned with child birth, her own child and her dragons, which is one of the domains of the Mother. Her fertility is a major part of her story.

The Maiden - purity, innocence, love, and beauty. Brienne of Tarth. She is a maiden and her lack of beauty is constantly referred to, beauty is listed as a trait of the Maiden. Not sure how this will be fulfilled but it's a theme that ties the two.

The Warrior - courage and strength - Jon Snow. He is likely the One who was Promised, known as the Warrior of Light.

The Stranger - death and the unknown. This is Arya. She has become a stranger, she is the agent of death and through changing her face is unknown.

Less sure
The Father - divine justice, and judges the souls of the dead. Samwell Tarly. This one is vaguer but think of his story- he was cast out by his father, this defines him, and he has adopted a child, becoming a better father than his own. He also spoke for Aemon in the manner of the watch at his funeral I think, linking him to speaking for the dead. Additionally he is the first to slay a white walker, possibly this is also judging the soul of the dead.

The Crone - wisdom and foresight. She is represented carrying a lantern. This is Melisandre. She sees the future in the flames, she's certainly a crone behind the glamour and torches seem to be strongly visually associated with her from memory.

The Smith - creation and craftsmanship. Gendry is all I've got for this, this is the weakest as the character seems to have had very little impact. Keep on rowing, rowing, rowing. His father Robert carried a hammer in battle and he used one as a smith.

"I was only a 'prentice, but my master said my hand was made to hold a hammer."
Sam the mother. Dany the father
I think it's Bran as the three eyed raven that brought Jon back from the dead
"Mercy, peace, fertility, and childbirth" are all sort of the opposite of what I associate with Dany. "Justice, fire & blood, barren,  and miscarriage" is more like it.  
Bran. CANNOT. Change. The past.

Think about it: They've all already survived. Why would Bran go back in time to ensure that they do something they are already doing? It's the same argument I make to anyone that says Bran is Bran the Builder. The Wall, etc., already exist. Why would he need to go back in time to "ensure". . .they exist?
the crone could possibly be male. Does that open up our options any further?
Hm. The description of the stranger made me think of Varys with his different disguises and general craftiness. 
I agree with most of this, but I'd say Davos is more The Father, and Tyrion the Smith. Davos' fatherly demeanor has helped out so many characters in the story (and his judgement is impecable, something the Father excels at), and Tyrion 'forges' together so many different houses and former enemies. 
Quoting /u/g0_west 

> "Mercy, peace, fertility, and childbirth" are all sort of the opposite of what I associate with Dany. "Justice, fire & blood, barren, and miscarriage" is more like it.

I think g0_west might be on to something. Maybe Daenerys actually represents the [Father](http://www.whats-your-sign.com/father-symbols.html), as fathers are often represented as strong, determinate and assertive characters, traits that describe Daenerys quite well. Meanwhile Sam is a wise, caring and compassionate person, traits that are often attributed to [mothers](http://www.whats-your-sign.com/symbol-for-mother.html), even back to ancient times. 

Daenerys represents the Father and Sam represents the mother, sounds like a proper, classical GRRM plot twist to me.
Sam would only be the father in a TV show. In the books (if you want to believe that any solid theory must be derived from source material) the baby is actually Mance Rayder's. Gilly's own baby is kept at Castle Black, whom is the son of Craster.

I think the aspects of the seven are some thing many characters aspire to , but never achieve.

None of the Starks (except Cat) follow the Seven so no use making comparisons there.  
This is a very good theory. I like it. 

Except for the part about Bran being responsible for creating them as gods in the past. Its not a bad idea but just one that I don't like. 

Can't it be attributed to ANY 3ER if that is the case? Or all the 3ERs, including Bran. For all we know the 3ER before Bran was a Stark too.

Bran or Tyrion could also be the Smith I feel like if you interpret it less literally as a iron smith/blacksmith.
Or this:

Father - Davos
Mother - Gilly
Crone - Olenna Tyrell
Warrior - Jorah
Smith - Samwell
Maiden - Brienne
Stranger - Jaqen H'agar

EDIT: spelling and removed link to Shitty Fan Theory. 
The Stranger is Littlefinger?
[deleted]
[removed]
Someone literally wrote this exact thing on here yesterday, at least give the person some credit.
Perhaps Arya is the maiden, and the Hound is the Stranger. Just musings, though!
Surely Mel would be the crone?
How is Cersei going to save Westeros?

I like the links between the Seven and some of the main characters but I don't think we should be dependent on those links. They don't see as developed as say TPTWP or AAR.
Honestly, it's hard to judge what the mods will call a repost. This is a years old theory, circulated hundreds of times, but I suppose in the down season this passes. 

I personally just wish people would google their theories before assuming they are new 
Naw Jon Was Resurrected And Not By The Faith Of The Seven

Just noticed the 8 "Gods" portrayed in the back. How cool would it have been if it were Seven instead?
Would also like to give a hearty recommendation of a visit to Girona for any Thrones fans in the Barcelona area. Only a 30 minute train journey and plenty of good sights which they used for filming!
Shame they couldn't find somewhere with 7 sides like its supposed to be, but I suppose 7 sided buildings are pretty rare in the real world 
Fake picture, everyone knows it was blown up. Stop editing pictures op!

/s
How many handbell rings did you get in before security escorted you away?
I wonder why they changed shooting locations. That building really looks nothing like [the original Sept](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/7e/501_steps_to_the_Great_Sept.png/revision/latest?cb=20150417100834).
It looks like they've done a very good job of restoring it since that whole wildfire incident. Kudos to them.
I'll bet there is at least a 300% increase in streaking complaints in that area now...
Man they rebuilt that sept really fast.
Where is it?  Spain?

#Shame!!!
Rule #1: Explosives of any kind are expressly prohibited. Violators subject to the walk of shame.
Every time I see the updated sept used for later seasons, I'm a little disappointed that Ned Stark got executed on top of a temporary stage.
Wow, they rebuilt that pretty quickly
What an incredible photo. Thank you for sharing it.
Considering there's eight statues, it's more of an Oct.
I heard that place is the BOMB!

Well that's a SHAME
Jaime is the Lord of the Westerlands now after his dismissal from the Kingsguard. Now that Jaime has completely fallen out with Cercei (the look they exchanged in S06E10 was meant to set up them completely falling away from each other in season 7) he will likely lead the armies of the Westerlands away from Cercei to someone else, or just themselves.
This is assuming that the western lords feelings towards Cersei will ever mentioned, which i doubt. 
I doubt Casterly Rock would abandon Cercei, she has enough enemies as it is, if the showrunners let's her lose her own House then who will be the Westerosi villain for S7? With Dorne and Highgarden against her, without Lannister support Cercei will be a goner real quick. (I assume Dany will be at sea for most of the season, perhaps chill at Dragonstone for a while and only land in Westeros mainland by end of S7). GoT needs a large "hey look at me!" villain to focus on and since Littlefinger is a behind-the-scenes schemer, Cercei it must be.

I agree that I think Euron will try to ally with Cersei. She does currently have fear on her side though. There are sure to be some houses still loyal to the Lannisters.

Though ultimately I can't see Cersei or Euron posing a threat unless they band together. And that is to the Jon and co. or to Dany and company. 

It could work inadvertently in that Euron will wage war primarily against Dany and co. while Cersei fights Jon. 
  cersei will not go quietly. She has a kingdom and lots of flamepower.
I think it would be really cool if the western lords came to support Tyrion, and through him, Daenerys. Imagine a scene similar to Jon's "coronation" where the western lords swear fealty to Tyrion. Would be neato. As for the Crownlands, hard to say. They could rally behind Daenerys... but we have to give Cersei some allies, right...?

But yeah, as others have pointed out, they probably won't even be mentioned.
Even if she has the Crownlands they're in a similar, if not the same state as the Riverlands (that is, butchered and burned to the ground with few or no towns/villages in conditions whatsoever.).
Considering the prophecy I think it's safe to say that she'll hold onto some semblance of power long enough for it to be taken away by the time Dany gets there; after which it's only a matter of time before the Valonquar gets her
At this point who else is left to support? The West just fought a brutal war with the Northmen, so there's no way they support Jon Snow or Robin Arryn. The Riverlands are de jure allied with the throne, but in practice the Freys would be lucky to maintain an uneasy peace. The Stormlands, the Reach and the Dorne have no true ruler at this point. Despite the fact that she just killed the throne's biggest ally, the Tyrells, it resulted in complicated succession (presumably if Olenna is the de facto ruler) in House Tyrell and they appear very weak to their vassals. I doubt it's really been mentioned in the show but the loyalty of House Tyrell's vassals are fairly tenuous when compared to the loyalty that other Great Houses command from their vassals due to other houses having superior claims to Highgarden (imagine if House Poole took over for House Stark). You can bet that the throne has been making the Targaryens look awful since the rebellion, so it practically leaves them with two options support Cersei and hope for the best or choose to not support Cersei, hope she loses and then hope Daenerys isn't the woman they expect her to be. They also remember what happened to the Reynes and Tarbecks after they rebelled against a seemingly weak House Lannister.

To paraphrase Littlefinger: perhaps it is better to align with the crazy you know rather than the crazy you don't.
That is assuming, that all the westerland's lords think it was actually her, who blew up the sept. There is no evidence.
does anyone know cersei did that though?
For those commenting on what Jamie will do, I wouldn't rule out the possibility that Cersei will threaten to blow the city sky high if he doesn't stay in line and back her up.  She knows that Jamie will forsake a lot to save that many people.
I having a feeling that she is just completely fucked. The real question is what will Jaime do, considering he will do whats best to save the masses, assumingly. I see Cersei yelling "burn them all" as Dany marches on KL and Jaime killing her, but prior to that, I am not sure. Like you said I highly doubt the Casterly Rock will support as she killed Kevan but I guess that's up to Jaime. I'm thinking season 7 first several episodes is just taking KL and then moving North
> All they know is that she blew up the Sept—  

Actually, no, they don't know this. We know this, because we're viewers, but most characters don't know this. Many characters suspect it, but they don't know it, especially outside of the capital. No one really even has any conception of how the Sept could have exploded. Wildfire? That's crazy! The last person who was known to use Wildfire was Tyrion, the convicted assassin of the previous king, who just so happens to be the Hand in a foreign invader's army.
1. Jaimie is Lord Lannister, head of House Lannister and Lord of Casterly Rock since Tommen dismissed him from the Guard.
2. The lesser Houses of the Westerlands now owe loyalty to Jaimie, though we don't know if any have done fealty personally for their lands. As such Jaimie can call on the levy of bannermen, their followers and the free commoners for military service. He also becomes commander of what's left of the Lannister standing army which was paid from the revenues of the mines that are now empty. 
3. As long as Jaimie accepts Cersei as Queen, the lesser Houses should support him. In Robert's Rebellion, however, some lesser Houses refused the support the position of their liege lords, both in the Vale and the Storm Lands. 
4. Cersei has the Crown Lands and the lesser Houses there who owe fealty directly to the Throne. Again, the lesser Houses could refuse to support her and her call on the levies. 
5. Tommen received at least one report from his Court about the Sept without the Frankenmountain present, so while rumors she killed Tommen can obviously come out, it would be outside the Court.
6. While Tywin created the Lannister and Tyrell alliance, it was already unraveling, thanks to Cersei allowing the Faith Militant to resurface and giving the Faith power to throw Marjorie and Loras into a dungeon and manufacturing the evidence to make that happen, which Ohlenna soon discovered. Cersei moved to keep control of Tommen, knowing she had already lost the Tyrells. 
7. Euron is going to raid the western and southern coasts of Westeros, perhaps even Oldtown. He certainly didn't build a thousand ships, but even 500 require 10,000 sailors and can carry 50,000 marines that need food, water and firewood, not to mention plunder to keep them happy. Unless Cersei negotiates an alliance, the Lannisters are going to get hit hard. Lannisport would make a great target, and the Lannisters only have 100-200 ships left. But an alliance makes sense as Euron wants Yara and Theon dead and they're supporting Danerys and Cersei need troops. 
8. The other possible alliance, if LF is smart and keep control of Lord Robyn and the Council, is with the Vale, which would give Cersei the cavalry force to oppose the Dothraki (no, there aren't 100,000 Dothraki, it would take 800 ships just to carry their horses, there are probably 15,000 Dothraki max). She could offer LF a place on the Great Council, confirm his Lord Protectorship of the Vale and make him Warden of the East. He could then promise to add the River Lands. 
She definitely didn't have Tommen killed. If she wanted Tommen killed, she would have had the Mountain do it, then blamed it on 'suicide', rather than leave Tommen in a room expecting him to jump.



Cersei's #1 motivation even ahead of personal power is keeping her children alive. After hearing that prophecy about all her future kids dying, she dedicated her life to preventing that from happening. Especially show Cersei, they have made it a point to emphasize how much she cares about her children since early in season 1. She'd NEVER purposefully do anything that would lead Tommen to harm.
**Daenerys**

**Targaryen**

Daenerys is Jon's aunt
Rhaegar Targaryen is Jon Snow's father. He was Daenerys' and Viserys' eldest brother. Therefore, Jon would be her nephew, and Daenerys his aunt.

welp cant complain we've already seen Cersei & Jamie go at it. The best GRRM can do now is some Dragon on Dragon action, i mean if they're the last of their kind you would think Daenerys would get them to mate.
The North - Season 3 because I love seeing the conclusion to Robb and Catelynns archs. Honourable mention to Season 6.

The Wall - Season 4 because it was the payoff of all the buildup to a Nights Watch vs Wildling battle.

Kings Landing - Season 4 because Tywin, Tyrion, Jaime, and Oberyn are all top notch in that season.

Across the sea - Season 1, really enjoyed Daenerys's adventures with the dothraki and seeing her get some solid character development. 
The North - I agree that season 2 had the strongest plots in the north. Between Bran/Lewin, Theon, Robb/Catelyn, there was a ton of diverse stories and great acting. Watching Robb make mistakes along the path of being king in the north foreshadowed his eventual downfall in S3.

The Wall - Season 4. Watchers on the wall is my personal favorite episode of the whole series. But the impact of Jon's return at castle black and watching the NW prep for the inevitable invasion by the Wildlings was amazing to watch. It also reintroduced Thorne as an adversary to John, and even added Janos Slynt as an additional "bad guy" in castle black. I feel like it also showed the best camaraderie between the NW brothers.

King's Landing - Season 1. Ned's story revealed the nature of KL from the get go. S1 showed all the scheming by different characters, controversy and scandals that are revealed, and watching the truth unravel in front of Ned's eyes set the pace for the entire series. There were a few conversations between Littlefinger and Varys that show incredible dialogue, and overall S1 had the clearest narrative of them all in my opinion.

Across the sea - Season 5 does it for me, mostly the Tyrion/Jorah story. Dany's plot was sort of boring to be honest until the end, but Tyrion's story was the strongest narrative of the entire season. Beginning as an exile who just murdered his father, it seems like all hope is lost for Tyrion. After gaining a sense of purpose thanks to Varys, he ends S5 as acting ruler of Mereen. Tyrion's rise was an incredibly clear and sensible narrative, and his dialogue along the way with Varys, Jorah, the masters and eventually Dany exemplified his cleverness.

The North - Definitely Season 6, it may seem cheesy but the moment Jon and Sansa saw each other was great and seeing the Stark banners flying over Winterfell again was touching. After 5 seasons of torture it was great to see the Starks catch a break.


The Wall - Season 4, Watchers on the Wall is possibly one of the best episodes of the series. Not to mention some great scenes by Tormund and Alliser Thorne.


King’s Landing: Season 1, I know a lot of people will say Season 2 but for me Season 1 set the standard of what to expect for the show only watchers. For book readers it was great to see images you imagined come to life visually.


Across the Sea - Dany’s Season 3 was outstanding she finally stopped being a victim and began to show her strength as a conquerer.

The North - Season 2. The Ironborn occupation of Winterfell was the most interesting part of it.

The Wall - Season 4. Night's Watch vs. Wildlings at long last. It culminated in a great battle, the death of Ygritte adding so much to Jon Snow's tragic character. Sam and Bran also had their respective storylines.

King's Landing - Season 2. There was nothing quite as enjoyable in King's Landing as watching Tyrion manoeuvre his way through the KL politics. His goal to not end up like the past 2 hands, his brilliant plan to lock up Pycelle, the great dialogue with Varys and Bronn, and the planning and actual defence of the city at Blackwater Bay. 7/7

Across the Narrow Sea - Season 3. Daenerys at her most badass, conquering Slaver's Bay, and the (re-)introduction of a few key characters; Barristan, Grey Worm, Missandei, and the creepier version of Daario Naharis.  
Gendry is nobody. 

The only way he could be somebody is if him and Sam discover the secrets to forging Valyrian steel. 

Or if he is the true born child of Robert and Cersei. 

But it is likely the former.
I don't think Dany would want to marry Gendry simply to end the rivalry between there two houses. Gendry isn't legitimised and doesn't have an army or any support. Their isn't even a war between the Baratheons and Targs anymore since the rest are dead. As for your second idea, it's more likely then the first but I think Arya would probably end up killing Cersei by herself ( If at all ) 
I think Davos will play a role in the reunion between Arya and Gendry. After all, he's the only one that really knows Gendry, and they even bonded over their origins from Flea Bottom. His background as a smith has been emphasized multiple times, so maybe he'll play a role in the forging of Valyrian steel if the method to create it is discovered. Davos would probably vouch for him, and with Jon being king in the north, he could legitimize him as a Baratheon. With Arya seemingly returning to Winterfell and Gendry traveling north via Davos/Jon, the north seems like the most likely place for a reunion.

Cool ideas but for your first idea I would've said he was legitimized by Dany and he has to marry her in order to keep his title
I never really understood why it was necessary to burn her. Especially because it wasn't even like Melisandre came up to Stannis being like "listen I need to tell you this, there is ONLY one way for you to win this thing." In fact, if I remember correctly, Melisandre is standing there silently, and Stannis is saying something about how the weather is shitty, and then she pipes up with "well there is a way..." And then from then on, somehow it's absolutely crucial to burn Shireen in order to win the battle. I thought it sort of came out of nowhere. I understand why it's helpful to the plot (pushes Stannis further towards defeat by his men deserting him, Davos discovers the burnt stag and gets Mel exiled, etc). But it doesn't really seem like Mel has a rhyme or reason to get her king's blood the way she does. I mean hell, if Shireen knew a bit of her blood would help dad win a war, I'm sure she would have been happy to get leeched for a minute. Gendry was fine wasn't he?
It actually doesn't make any sense at all. Melisandre's magic has done much greater things than melting snow without any human sacrifice at all - she didn't sacrifice anyone to resurrect Jon Snow, give birth to a shadow demon, curse the lives (or at least foretell the deaths) of Stannis' rivals. It didn't make sense for her to decide that her king's only child needs to burn in order to do something as trivial as change the climate.

One could argue that, maybe burning people alive is what sustains her unnaturally-long life (400 years old, apparently), but even then it didn't make any sense for her to target Stannis' daughter specifically at that time and place.

This isn't Melisandre being a fanatic, it's just poor writing, right on par with Ramsey Snow's twenty good men destroying half of Stannis' provisions somehow.
Melisandre obviously thought a greater sacrifice would have a greater chance of earning the Lord of Light's favor.  This is consistent with Gendry, whom she wanted to burn also even after leeching him.  She obviously thought more than just leeches was needed in his case, so it's not hard to believe she'd feel the same way about Shireen.  
I think [& this is my pet theory idk if anyone feels this way or it's been posted] Mel saw a vision of Shireen cooking a while ago, and had told Stannis... just offscreen. Stannis was like "*fuck that*, she is my *DAWTAH*, never gonna happen." BUT Stannis saw how he was at such a major disadvantage against the Boltons... especially after 20 Good Men. He gave in to what he thought was the inevitable, and... toasted his own daughter in order to overcome such odds... 

I feel like certain scenes implied that Stannis and Mel had argued about it in the past.

But I also think the Lord of Light kind of manipulated Melisandre. 

In order to get a sacrifice to *power-up* Mel.... so she has can resurrect a certain homeboy.





I thought Mel just really wanted to burn Shireen because of her disease. Mel thought Shireen was a curse and bad luck for the campaign. For whatever reason she was convinced that sacrificing the cursed diseased child would save the campaign. Ultimately it lead her to Jon Snow, so Mel probably still feels justified in her actions.

It's lazy writing to just use the same trick over and over. From a thematic point that' s probably the answer. (SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS WITH LEECHES!!!)
They would've, but Roose would've felt insulted that he wasn't invited to the leeching party and he'd have just marched on Stannis's camp himself. In all seriousness though idk. (Sorry for not coming up with a serious answer.)
Isn't the Wall based on Adrian's Wall and not the Great Wall? 
wall was not built to keep wildings out

BECAUSE HE PROMISED LYANNA HE WOULDN'T 
Because he didn't know Catelyn. She was supposed to marry Ned's brother, Brandon, who died in the hands of the Mad King. So basically they married, had sex, and Ned left for a whole year to go to war. Then suddenly he comes back with a Targaryen baby, and he's supposed to tell A STRANGER that secret? Of course not, it'd be too dangerous.
You may be asking youself "but why didn't he tell her later, when he started trusting her?". Because it would seem too odd if suddenly Catelyn, who hated Jon, suddenly started loving him. It was safer for everyone to keep it completely secret.
Because if she blabbed or it got out the north would of been at war with the other 6 kingdoms.It was safer for jon to be known as his bastard and for ned to never speak of it 
I wonder if Ned worried immensely until Jon grew hair. If he's blonde and purple eyed that's pretty hard to cover for

Telling Catelyn could have meant that she would have treated Jon differently, not as the reminder of Ned's infidelity that he supposedly was. Even the slightest change and attitude towards Jon could have been a giveaway that Ned's story didn't add up, on top of the fact that Ned was super-honorable.
Because if anyone knew Jon was a Targ, mainly Robert, and especially the son of Rhaegar he would have had a death sentence. Ned would have had to rebel against his best friend to save his family. This isn't a hard concept and its been covered a thousand and one times
Doubt it. He killed the Karstark dude for killing two Lannister kids, he would have killed Theon for killing two orphans, Ser Rodrick and indirectly Maester Luwin. Even though he wasn't as honorable as his father (he broke the oath to marry a Frey), it still meant a lot to him.
I think he would have forgiven him and then executed him. And in a way that would be Theon's happiest moment, to be forgiven and released by the person he cares for most 
Well I certainly will never forgive Theon so I doubt Robb would.  Theon's regret doesn't absolve him of what he did.  
nah robb would have killed him without as much as a second thought.
Well Robb believed that Theon killed Bran and Rickon, which he didn't. he just wanted people to think that. If Robb found out that Theon didn't actually kill Bran and Rickon I think he would still have Theon killed.
Do we forgive Theon for what he did? He did suffer plenty though. I think if Robb took into account the torture Theon went though, he would have let him join the Night's Watch.
Hell no! He was Robb's close friend and he betrayed him.

If I were in Robb's position and got my hands on Theon I'd probably do the same thing Ramsey did... more or less. 
Hello no.

/thread
I don't think he would. Theon weakened the position of the northerners at a critical time. He was directly responsible for the deaths of Luwin and two of Robb's innocent young subjects, and indirectly responsible for the sack of winterfell which resulted in far more death.

Maybe, maybe not. I'm more interested in what Jon is going to do when he see's Theon though.
Nah, Robb would have put him down. Even if he confessed that he didn't kill Bran and Rickon (and instead two innocent farmer boys) - he still killed two kids. And he also killed Sir Rodrick and I think the Measter as well? Not to mention the betrayal itself - he just helped himself to Winterfell (while being played by own his father). 

Robb would have executed him for treason, murder, betrayal, and for being a thorough dumbass.

Jon OTOH.. not sure. Doubtful Jon will execute him, although I can't imagine he will be best buds with him. Even Tyrion looked down on him for his behavior.

I think he would have killed him regardless. He would have asked him "Why Theon?? Why would you do this to your family??" Theon would probably cry and apologize many times over and beg for forgivness, most likely telling him through all the blubbering he didn't kill Bran and Rickon. Robb would then raise him to his feet, say he forgave him, then have him taken to the ol' chopping block and do his duty to The North. 
No it is completely non canon and is made up only for the game. GRRM himself says that the game is just that, a game. The families aren't part of the real story, the events that take place don't happen in the real story. 
Does anyone else get heavy fan fiction vibes from the Telltale Games? Like cannon or not, I'm just talking about the quality of the story verses the books/show? I dunno, what do you guys think?

Anywhere that i can get the other episodes for free? I was just looking this up an hour ago so this post must be fate haha
House forrester is mentioned once IIRC as an ally of the starks but the game does not interfere with the series/books storyline.
I've always thought that the North Grove will play into the story in some way. Other than that it's just a story about a squabble between some minor northern houses.
Sounds like a lot of screen time for someone that isn't Carice van Houten. Pretty sure she'll keep the magic necklace on and just meet up with thoros and co

Please just leave these forums!! 

How you have not seen spoilers beyond where you're at I'm not sure. But, you must go...unless you want to see details of things to come. 

Even posts marked as 'spoilers' still spoil because they can often mention characters names - allowing you to figure out who's still alive / relevant / dead / whatever.

Save yourself!

Hey /r/trees is that way
And he is a secret Targaryen. And he's a blackfrye too. And he is actually  sir Arthur Dwayne and his trusty knife is Dawn. And he is the Blood raven too. In fact he is the Night King.
biggest stretch of a theory 
I like the idea, but if just doesn't fit. Daario isn't even much of a major character at this point, GRRM wouldn't make the prince who was promised be such a minor character. Not trying to shoot you down, just wouldn't add up. Also, practically every character has been around salt and smoke for the majority of their lives...

This sounds pretty awesome i'm not going to lie
He was a dick to Daenerys and sold slaves.
i would say because 1) he was an asshole and 2) he fell under her edict to the unsullied to kill the masters, the soldiers, and any man who holds a whip. she planned from the beginning to overthrow the city and as master of the unsullied he was a principal target. there was no version of her plan that left him alive, i expect.
He constantly insulted Daenerys in Valyrian, thinking she doesn't speak the language. And he was also a slaver, and Daenerys wants to free all the slaves, starting with the Unsullied.
He would have created more Unsullied, something that Daenerys obviously wanted to avoid. He was also a dickhead. 
Lots of good points mentioned already but also she looked pretty upset about the 3000 dead babies.  Every unsullied soldier had to rip one from their mother and kill it to show they had no weakness.

Not to mention it's the only way to get Drogon back after trading. .
She needed to show that she wasn't weak in the face of a disrectful asshat, plus by killing this guy, she kept her Unsullied purchase potentially secret (for awhile anyways) from Westeros/King's Landing.
End of spring at the earliest... I think considering production was delayed. First teaser might come sooner though... Maybe as soon as "winter as ended" and a "dream of spring" comes into fruition...  ***Dont hate me.***
I just saw some pictures from an HBO preview on the front page, but I'd hardly call that a trailer.
I'll say the first week of May
Pretty confident that we'll see at least a teaser by March. 
March, considering production is delayed 2 months and we usually get the first trailer in January
I'd say may
March or april
2017
I believe there was a teaser for s6 in January. So that was around four months before it started so I'll go with four months before the projected date of s7. February/march.

I love the little details, especially the ghost at Harrenhal and the fact that Storm's End is a mushroom castle. Yoshi Dragonstone is also great. 

Oldtown is a major omission but I'll forgive it.
Dude, those squid things for Pyke...could you make this anymore fun and amazing? Can I be your brother in law too or something?

Best hope he doesn't come on here and see it.

Also I read this as "I just framed my brother in law"... It sounded Game of Thronesy.
Have you considered selling prints of this? I'd definitely buy one
Brother in law's wife: "You can hang it up when he comes over, otherwise it's staying in the closet". 
Absolutely amazing. Great work! :)

But, yeah, as others have pointed out, that "Nesteros" is like a fucking nail in my eye! :( It was so close to absolute perfection.
The mushroom tower under kings landing looks like a dick. But this thing is still amazing

Everytime I see this image, I can't help but marvel at the amount of detail that was put into it.

People aren't just good or bad, we're all a mix.
I had that moment too when out of the blue the series started portraying him in an overly sympathetic light. When he was imprisoned in Robb Stark's camp, he did nothing but mock and insult the woman whose child he threw off a tower to hide his affairs with his sister, literally the second Brienne got him out I started getting a sympathetic vibe from the cinematography that clashed with my perception of the character. I was like, "Nope, I'm not warming up to an incestuous child-killer, fuck that".

It got better after a while. Now Jaime's one of my favorite characters.
> Is he good or bad. 

A central theme in both the themes and the show is that people are not good or bad.

Personally I dislike Jaime. He's a pompous, arrogant prick. The only reason he's remotely decent now is because... (this thread is no spoilers)
Jaime is my favorite character on the show because of his complexity. Personally, I don't see him as particularly vile. Yes, he does engage in one of the most forbidden of taboos, but we have to consider his development. I can't really go into it because of the no spoiler thread, but he grows, suffers, and goes through moral conflict. He isn't a bad man or a great man. He's Jaime.
Let's put it like this S6 Jamie would not like S1 Jamie very much.  Even as a young man though I would not characterize Jamie as "bad," but he definitely does have a redemption character arch.  


Another thing, while I do think that there are a handful of "bad" characters on GOT, most do not cleanly fall into one category or the other.  For instance, I would even say that Tywin is not really a *bad* character.

I could go through and break down almost everything he says or does aside from tossing bran from the tower as ok and honorable in his way if you understood him. 
The creator of this series said he favorite characters are the "grey" area ones.  Characters where you have to make your own decisions and wonder. He said those are the realest characters because they are like everyday people  
All of the above.
He was never really *bad.*

He was definitely cocky and bored though. We see him early on from the viewpoint of the Starks which makes him "bad" but he's usually doing things for his family.

As everything starts to fall apart, Jaime can no longer be cocky and carefree.

Tywin points this out as well in the show. I'm not sure if he says the same thing in the books. 

Tywin Lannister: [sneers] Clean? You spend too much time worrying what other people think of you. 

Jaime Lannister: I could care less what anyone thinks of me. 

Tywin Lannister: That's what you want people to think of you. 

Jaime Lannister: It's the truth. 

Tywin Lannister: And you hear them whispering "Kingslayer" behind your back, doesn't it bother you? 

Jaime Lannister: [reluctantly] Of course it bothers me. 

[Spoilz](#s "It's a good way to describe Jaime's character then and now. Except that he is no longer cocky because he has no hand and Tywin is dead.")

No she didn't know. She thinks some pretty hateful things about Jon and says some pretty nasty things towards him too 
Cat was a proud woman, if someone gave her crap for being the wife to "someone who has fathered a bastard" then there's no way she would keep the 'secret' to herself
I feel the books kind of make this theory extremely unlikely. The character had POV chapters and she didn't know. She specifically asks Ned if Ashara Dayne is Jon's mother, which was something she heard people gossip about. He becomes extremely angry and tells her to never ask again. She remembers that is the only time that she had been scared of her husband. She then lets the subject go but continues to stew in her own bitterness. In the books, Jon's mother is a mystery to her as well.  It's pretty clear. 
I wouldn't say so. Her and Sansa are the only ones in the Stark household who have kept Jon at an arm's length, and she would have treated him not as badly as she does, which was what Ned would have wanted. And while she said hateful things about Jon, the things she said probably wouldn't have been as bad had she known that Jon was her nephew-in-law (him being Lyanna's child should outweigh him being Rhaegar's). Catelyn is smarter than a number of women on the show, but she still trusted Baelish and Walder Frey despite knowing some of their more unscrupulous traits
She could've known and been in on the "act" but I doubt it... Like others have said, her "thoughts" are still negative regarding Jon. It doesn't really change the story either which way, except that she could love Ned knowing he was always loyal.
*Catelyn btw
Although its not nice to think so, i think she died thinking Jon was Ned's bastard.
I don't think Catalyn knew, but I do think Ned had full intentions to tell at least Cat and Jon (if not all the Starks) the truth when it was safe (Bobby B died)
I mean I guess it's possible but I really don't think that's the case.

>Robb DIDN'T oppose Stannis

Robb supported an independent North, which stands in the way of Stannis becoming King of the Seven Kingdoms. 
Not unless you believe the whole leech thing 


>1.) The Red Wedding isn't mentioned and us (the audience) don't get to see any plotting of the red wedding. I know it was MEANT TO be a shock, but I'm suprised. It just happens 

We don't get the actual plotting but it's made obvious what happened in the aftermath. Tywin was getting worried about Robb's growing campaign so he plotted against him with Roose and Walder. It "just happens" because they needed to strike fast and by surprise since Robb was usually surrounded by alert bodyguards not drunk friends who think they're protected by guest rights. If Roose were actually loyal to Robb he wouldn't have returned Jaime to King's Landing. 

2.) Melisandre hates anyone who opposes Stannis, Robb DIDN'T oppose Stannis. I never got this

He didn't oppose him but he didn't support him. Robb wanted a free north Stannis didn't.

When Stannis learned of Robb's death, Melisandre credited the Lord of Light for it (via her leech ritual).  And while Stannis and Robb never fought one another, Stannis claims kingship over all of Westeros including the North and explicitly rejects the idea of allowing the North to have its own king.  

Anyway, all Melisandre did was the leech thing which she believes caused Robb's death.  She didn't conspire with anyone; that was all the Lannisters, Freys and Boltons.  
No. The Lord of Light caused it. 
She saw something of Robbs death in the flames and arranged things so that she/R'hollor could take credit for it in Stannis' camp.
Tywin Lannister caused the red wedding to end the norths independene war. 

The red priestess would probably frown at killing people without fire. Maybe if they just locked everyone in the hall and burned it down.

"And you shall have it"
Eddard Stark was a class act.
Absolutely love the History & Lore that comes with the Blu Rays.
"After Robbert's coronation, I returned the sword to Starfall" so after the Tower of Joy, he went to Kingslanding with Jon, then back to Starfall and then to winterfell, all with Jon?
His two sword stance was awesome, but I wish the show made a point of him using Dawn. 
Ned Stark is the true hero.

Of course, hopefully Jorah gets wind of the fact that Jon Snow *also* was killed in a mutiny by his own men, and was actually the beloved and trusted steward of Jeor ~~fookin~~ Mormont.


As King in Da Norf, Jorah still might dislike Jon because of his presumed parentage and more pressingly because Jon might pose a threat to Danery's rule over the 7 Kingdoms... A threat dealt with through marriage, I assume. 


Which, you know, is just more reason for Jorah to hate Jon, if Jon is going to steal the dragon Jorah wants to mount. 
Does Jorah actually dislike Ned?  
He always seems very honest and remorseful about his past actions, and I remember one line where he talked about how Ned spared his life, in order to convince Dany to do the same for other slavers.  

It would seem very out of character for someone who acknowledges that his past actions were wrong and who acknowledges that Ned's punishment was merciful, to then turn around and be pissed off at Ned for banishing him.  
Regarding the sword: Jorah had the sword when he was condemned by Ned, but he voluntary surrendered it back to Jeor.  So I doubt that he thinks he's entitled to the sword now (unless he feels like he's redeemed himself enough that it's his by right, by I think that would be out of character for him).  
First of all, *if* Jorah ever meets Jon we'll see what happens. He has contracted greyscale after all and is currently scouring Essos for a cure. Secondly, if Jorah makes it back to Westeros I imagine he would hear the tale about the bastard son of Ned Stark who became Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, was a victim of mutiny himself, left the Night's Watch, fought the Boltons and won, retook Winterfell, and became the King in the North. In short, Jon is famous now. His story will be well known. Even if they don't waste time showing us this conversation it's safe to assume Jorah will hear it. Thirdly, he won't want Longclaw back at all. He could still have Longclaw if he wanted it. He left it behind when he was exiled. He's been an honorable character since we met him. I don't think he'd be a punk about his sword at this point.

I am curious to see how Jorah will feel regarding Longclaw. Lyanna doesn't seem to mind. In fact I don't remember if it came up with her during Season 6 at all.

I think Jon will give Longclaw to Jorah if he is able to forge or find another valyrian sword/weapon. 

Then again, there are theories that Longclaw isn't even a Mormont heirloom. So it might not ever come up. Plus Jon switched the pommel from a bear to a white wolf didn't he?

Jon doesn't want the throne except for the influence it will grant in gathering forces to fight the WW. So I think he will be willing to give it up to Auntie Dany if she lets him babysit his cousins Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion for a day of mass slaughter.
If Jorah goes to Old Town and runs into Sam, I wouldn't be shocked if Sam gives Jorah the run down on what happened at, and beyond the wall.
When Jorah meets Sam at the Citadel, he will be filled in about his father.  He will most likely have respect for Jon knowing that Jon sent a party to kill the people that killed his father.
They viewed Jon Snow is a defector from the Watch, and the bastard son of a disgraced and nearly-extinct House Stark to boot.
The Boltons are monsters.

Roose Bolton was made Warden because of his house's reputation as being sadistic and of course his betrayal of Robb. I myself think Roose wasn't THAT bad. But Ramsay was an absolute monster. He was smart, relentlessness, and proves it several times from when we meet him onward. 

He had the north scared shitless. To them it wasn't a matter of "Yah we'll probably win under if we band together like we should" it was a matter of "If we lose... even if its a small chance, Ramsay will do worse than have our families skinned alive."
Show wise my first thoughts go to making it a more dramatic experience. Would the BoTB have been any fun if it were a complete stomp of the Boltons when the entire North banded together against them? No.

As for Cerywn, his logic was that he was afraid. In the show I believe it is stated that Ramasay flays his father; there's a line I barely remember where Ramsay claims to have Killed young Cerwyns father after he refused to pay his taxes, then "the new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes."

I suppose Cley Cerwyn would've been to frightened of Ramsay to try and do anything. His father, mother and uncle were flayed alive. As for Manderly he says that "he did not want more Manderlys dying for nothing."

Sometimes the logic that show show follows might not seems like the right choice but it certainly makes for an entertaining viewing which is what it is meant to be about anyway.
Just one reason: Fear of The Boltons. I think it's in s6e5 (please correct me if I'm wrong) Sansa argues that Northeners are more loyal but Davos said to Sansa: "The Northeners may be loyal but how many rolls up against The Boltons when they betrayed your family? I may not know the north but I know men. The more or less the same in any corner of the world. And even the bravest of them don't want to see their wives and children's killed for a lost cause." What Davos said couldn't be more eloquent and succinct in explaining why the Northern Lords is afraid of retribution from Ramsay Bolton.
They needed a good underdog story. But yeah, united they could have defeated the boltons fairly easily. 
plot.
As far as they could see, it was a suicide mission. Jon would definitely lose, and the families of those that supported him would get tortured by Ramsay.
Mainly Robb. Robb pretty much ruined the North for them. Also the Boltons had Winterfell, it would have seemed like dying for a lost cause which they didn't really care about. Until Jon proved everyone wrong and in response they declared him as King almost as a sort of apology.
None of them want to throw any more men into the grinder for a House that is effectively dead in a fight against the three most powerful houses of the North. Mormont was the only house to join out of loyalty, thanks to Davos's moving speech. 

It makes perfect sense in my opinion. Sansa's marriage to the Boltons mattered in gaining support to have an heir with Stark blood, because that would be better than nothing at all. 

Legitimizing Jon would have made him an official Stark male, and with him following King Stannis to crush the Boltons, they would have likely rallied the rest of the North behind them. 
Look at the perspective of the North: You supported the Starks for thousands of years. Eddard Stark was the most beloved of them all. He was executed unjustly and in rage, the North rose up against King's Landing with Robb as their leader. 

Robb marches South taking all of the fighting men with him. Many of those men will never return home to see their families, plant crops, etc because of Robb's decision to break his oath to Walder Frey and marry a "foreign whore". 

While Robb is in the South with the army the North is raided and occupied by the ironborn. Long standing castles fall to their reavers and they kill and rape and pillage all the way across the land. While that is going on their King does nothing. 

The Red Wedding happens - most of that army is slaughtered because of Robb's oath breaking. House Bolton now rules the North, having a large and massive army at its back. Those that stand up to Roose and his bastard - look at Lord Cerwyn - are skinned alive and displayed for all to see. 

They retake the castles lost to the Ironborn and give them back, with the implicit warning of "we helped you, we can take it away". 

What's more is that you hear that Ned Stark's bastard is letting wildlings by the thousands into the North - the wildlings who have raided, raped and pillaged for thousands of years when they were able to get beyond the Wall. 

Why would the North remember when there's nothing left for them? 

From a show perspective it makes sense as well; you can't have House Bolton Versus Every Other Northern House because it would literally be a curbstomp roflmao easy battle and that kind of thing doesn't make for good television. 
It was so the knights of the vale could ride to the rescue,and that sansa could be seen as a alternative leader to jon.


They were bitter towards the Starks and fearful of the Boltons, I imagine.  Lord Glover also hesitated in part because the Boltons helped kick out the Ironborn, so other houses may have felt the same.  
When Robb married Talisa instead of a Frey the North lost the war. The Stark bannermen made sacrifices but it was all for nothing since their king couldn't keep his word. The Stark name was mud.

Edit: I just realised you pretty much covered that in your op...
1. He is a bastard, not a Stark.    
   
2. No one would believe he had died and been resurrected, so they considered him an oathbreaker.    
   
3. Many suffered great loses in the War of the Five Kings

Well said. I suppose it wasn't pretty but here we are with Arya back in Westeros.
One thing that seems to have been brought up multiple times during the show, but never fully solved, is the problem of the Iron throne's debt to the iron bank.  The bank is probably extremely rich... definitely enough so to pay the faceless men to take care of their problematic customers in westeros.  When Arya is leaving the city, Jaqen seems pleased with himself.  Is it possible that Jaqen has specifically trained Arya to give those on her list to the many faced god?
The biggest problem with the Arya storyline was how poorly it was handled,so you double cross the most powerful organisation of assassins who can change there face and then u go about in public without a care in the world?Then you get stabbed in the gut,which was a horrendous way to die in them times,but that big long blade somehow doesnt nick your intestines or anything.

But the main problem for me was how she just randomly showed up at the twins with 0 set up.
The show decided not to show more faceless men for convienance. This lack of people does not exist in the book, and they're shown in much more detail. With even how targets are chosen and which faceless man will make the kill. 
I don't get why jaqen has such a soft spot for arya. 
I think perhaps to become No One you have to take that away from another No One


So when Arya surpassed and overcame her mentor (and tormentor) she proved herself and acquired the title


The origin story of The Faceless Men was all about rising up from despair and overpowering those who put you in it the first place.. and that's what Arya did .. her "rulers" wanted to abuse her (by making her do something she didn't want to do and thought was wrong). She took a stand and fought back and she won.


**Waif allowed herself to be enslaved by the Faceless Men while Arya fought back and broke her chains** and that's what really created the House of Black and White in the first place.. not the assassinations nor the gift of Mercy but breaking from your chains.. the ones put on you as much as the ones you put on yourselves

Sounds like a cool theory so what you are saying is wall Jaqen did fail in having her become no one because arya reclaimed the identity of arya he did succeed in having her become a killer by atleast brutally teaching her the skills of he faceless men and arya is using these skills to kill her targets but has rejected the faceless men culture even though Jaqen still in a sense got what he wanted which is why he let her go
Arya has been my favorite character from the beginning, I believe she will have a massive impact on the story. I'm halfway threw the first book and just finished the tv series. Maybe even some how align with daenerys, or assassinate her. Either way it will be huge  
I dont see many people noticing but there is a huge difference between Jaqen ordering her (Arya) death, and acepting Waif permission to kill her, he just did the second. If Jaqen wanted Arya dead, he would easily done it, all he did was giving permission for someone else to try to kill her, wich he may had considered a good test for Arya. 
However, I think Jaqen agreeing with the statement "She could never be one of us," was literal. He is wise, so a snark remark would be logical. 
Guys, let's stop trying to rationalize the Arya storyline. It was a poorly written rendition of a very vague outline given to them by GRRM. The fact of the matter is, Season Six is by far the weakest season of "Game of Thrones" so far, and I don't think it's a coincidence that it is the first season that has had to operate 90% without book material. 

In fact, it isn't just Arya's storyline where the bad writing shows up. I could go on for days bitching about the King's Moot, Jon Snow being declared "King of the North" after deserting the Night's Watch, Dany's rushed rise to power amongst the Dothraki, the horrible plodding filler scenes with Tyrion and Myssandei/Greyworm, the chronological dysphoria the show seems to suffer from (where it takes Sam and Gilly months to reach Horn Hill, but Arya somehow gets back to the Twins from Braavos in a matter of days). 

But I won't. This isn't the thread for that. Suffice to say, there's only one explanation to the Arya plotline that doesn't require any mental gymnastics to try and justify: It's just bad writing!
I wrote this on another post but this is how I see this exact same episode you mentioned. I also believe the episode the door has all the answers but I come up with a different ending. "Arya" looked sadistic for a reason. It was not Arya. I know those continue to say "oh the tinfoil" but it's not if you let go of precious Arya. In season 6 the episode The Door subtlety (not well enough it seems) how Arya will never become them and they only want her FACE as a GIFT. The viewer should recall Arya being beaten for two seasons now on her own past. Who is this person? What did you do with them? How do you feel about them? Etc etc. Anytime she lied she was smacked. Not for her gain.. because the waif who needed this information needed ALL of the correct information and not lies. 

In the episode we see Arya and the waif battling with sticks and Arya knocked down. The waif then says "you will never be one of us" in to which Jaqen appears and says "a girl has a point". Next scene shows Arya walking with Jaqen and he goes on to tell the history of the faceless men saying none were ever born from Lords or ladies and that they were offered a GIFT..a FACE. He then proceeds to give Arya her task in killing lady Crane and says either way a face will be added to the hall. 

When Arya asks Jaqen why lady Crane and that she seems nice Jaqen responds with "does death only come for the wicked?" Arya says no and the scene ends. 

We then see Arya purposely fail at her target lady Crane. Next scene is the waif and Jaqen (carving a face off just so viewers can connect the waif knows this technical part of how to do so) and he tells her (the waif) she can go through with her target. 

Once the waif stabs Arya and we see her in the home of lady Crane does the waifs true journey begin. We see the waif kill lady Crane, essentially taking out the initial intended target (remember a debt was paid whether it be to someone undeserving or not)as well as chase after Arya in "terminator" mode with the same sadistic stare. In Fact we've come quite accustomed to that sadistic smirk and stare that when you see it acted out through another actress most miss it. 

Final scene shows "Arya" giving her famous lines of "a girl is Arya stark" with Jaqen giving his approval that she is now no one and then her walking off not with injury but same stride and upright pose as the waif. 

We then finally get to see "Arya" kill Walder and show the same sadistic smile to imply it's the waif.  Arya on her deathbed of lady Crane never mentioned going home or having unfinished business. In fact it was the opposite. Writers even tried to show the viewer she was more concerned with what was west of westeros. Not revenge.  Walder Frey was killed by the faceless men who have a bigger play in the works. 

Most telling this is most likely correct. Maisie wrote that when she received her scripts for season 7 that she had to go and reread her story in season 6 due to a MAJOR character twist. Hmmm? Its all there. Whether the die hard fans choose to believe it or not


i kinda wonder if this is a whole Tyler Durden kinda thing.
Remember that Arya drank from the well and didn't die and Jaqen said she was finally no one so maybe she died and didn't notice because of the stuff she drank, could be one of the effects of that stuff and the faces. Also notice at the end when Arya pokes Jaquen with Needle and he pushes against the sword with no pain whatsoever. Plus faces are as good as poison unless she is no one and she did wear a face to cook for Walder without problems so she is no one now :) I suspect Arya will die next season and then come back like Jaquen did.
In that faceless room, when Arya snuck up on Jaqen.. What was Jaqen talking about?  He said "you're finally no one"  But he knows what Arya had done..Was he just saying that to save his own life? 

Also, if Arya walked away from the faceless organization (burned bridges)  How is she able to still change her face?  Do they bring and carry extra faces with them or is it some kind of magic.? 
  She survived the stabbing because the wounds were not fatal.   just that simple.
As long as we enjoy talking about it, it doesn't matter. The show is great, The book is great. GRRM made a f*cking brilliant piece.
Every time i try to talk about GoT with my brothers, my cousins, my friends, they always give me this blank fucking stare, like "What are you on about mate?" When i try to discuss a character with them, it always goes like this, 

"Me: So, what did you think about Daenerys this season?

They: Who?

Me: Daenerys? Daenerys Targaryen? The fucking Mother of Dragons? 

They:.......Oh, you mean Khalessi!

Me: (Deep breaths) I love you, but you're a fucking idiot sometimes."
On the flip side, there's no better feeling than realizing the person you're talking to about the series is just as educated as you are.
I have to reign in my geekdom constantly. Sometimes it still gets away from me and my friends and family get to peek behind the curtain of me trying to keep it cool. I read the books, watch the show, listen to Bald Move podcasts analyzing the crap out of it, watch YouTube tributes people put up AND come on here to babble about this show. My husband loves the show too but on a MUCH more superficial level, and that's okay too.
No, because I just push through and explain anyways, if you're my friend/boyfriend/family member then you know I'm gonna talk anyways and I'd listen to you about something I'd like, so I see no problem there
Yes, so much. Most of my friends only watch the show apparently as background noise or something. Some of them are in season 3 and don't know anyones names or what happened in the previous seasons.
Someone didn't get the reference when I said hold the door and I cried a little
Yes, but not for reasons given here.  I have a friend who read all the books and I had talked about it when I was going through the show for the first time.  Well, it turns out he stopped watching in season 2 and read the books years ago, and he doesn't really "get into" his fiction the same way I do, so I know a lot of stuff from the books that he's forgotten or never really pieced together because I've read about it on the ASOIAF wiki.  So sometimes i feign ignorance so that I'm not like, upstaging him on his book knowledge (not that he would probably care, it just feels rude to be like "ACTUALLY" when I haven't even read them)

Yeah I definitely relate... My knowledge/passion of the show has taken off much more than my other friends who watch. :\ #feelsbadman
I've been rewatching the series with my mother. Luckily we have the recaps, but she does tend to forget a few things. The names mainly. She can keep up with the story fine, but when secondary characters take the spotlight like Theon in Season 2, she has a tough time remembering who he was in Season 1. 
Basically everyone I talk to pronounces peoples names wrong and it happens so much that I have to let it go. I've heard "eye-ya" (Arya), "little fingers", Petey Baelish, "Whore-door" (Hodor), and "Die-Narys" to name a few

The Petyr Baelish ones are always funny though
Wow!  You are an ass!

Maybe those who are "too stupid" have a life and care more about other topics than GOT!
I feel like over the last decade, people are turned off when someone knows too much about a subject. Any subject. When talking to someone you don't know well enough, stick to the "lite" dumbed down version. When you're with friends or people you KNOW are high off of GoT, ASOIAF, GRRM, etc, go all out.
WHERE did u get this?????????????????????

How good is the t-shirt quality? I have been wanting to buy some stuff there but its kinda expensive for me, is it worth?
A girl has no age.
I don't think the show has a solid timeline. It's really vague about passage of time, often just saying "years". Some people estimate about two seasons per year, some estimate as much as a season per year.
[removed]
LOL Margaery is supposed to be like 18 and Tommen 14 or something but the actors were 34 and 17 respectively. One reason we didn't get to see more *boobs* during Tommen's wedding night 😒 
Depends on if its the show or books. Everyone is aged on the show. Cat says 17 years ago you came back with another woman's child which indicates Jon is atleast 17 when leaving for the Wall which would make him atleast 23 after 6 years if each season is a year. 

When the king visits winterfell in the pilot the Stark Children are arranged in order according to age aside from Rickon who is at Cat's side. Arya is ahead of a 10 year old bran in this line, she could be 11 in the pilot and then 17 upon her return to Westeros. 

From this the other's ages can be estimated to be Robb being conceived before Ned left for the war so Robb is most likely 17 or at the oldest 18 as Cat and Ned didn't spend much time together before Ned left for Robert's Rebellion which was about a year. 

As for sansa she is said to be 13 at the feast in the pilot so at the end of s6 she'd be 19. 
The book starts 14 years after the end of Roberts rebellion, making John and Dani about 14. The show starts 2 years later, making them about 16. Aria is 5 years younger then John, meaning she starts the show at 11.

I have no estimate for their age as of season 6. Im guessing 2 or 3 years older. 
16?
She's 9 at the start of the books and the show scaled everything up by 2 years so she would have been 11 when it all started.
The wiki says she's 16.
I believe they only aged everyone up slightly was because of the whole Dany and Drogo scenes on the show

I've thought a lot about that, I think it would make more sense if Jon was a non Valeryan version of his true name, but whatever it is we'll have to wait and see since there isn't any evidence and even then it would just be speculation until grrm tells that tale.
his name is hank 
1) If Ned came back with a child that had even a remotely Targ name, people may suspect something.
2) Ned admired Jon Arryn and naming him after someone that it is clear Ned loved wouldn't raise any suspicion.
3) Here's the poetic answer: Jon Arryn rebelled against the crown to protect his two wards that he raised like sons. So he started a rebellion to protect two kids he raised that weren't his. Sort of poetic, because if Robert would have discovered Jon's parentage, there is no way Ned would have gave him up to be killed either. So every time he said Jon's name, he remembered the same loyalty he was once shown and it reminded him of his oath and what he had to do to keep his nephew safe.
Wel, there is no Aejon in the Targaryen family tree. We know that Jon is a name given by Ned in honor of Jon Arryn to Jon(Snow).

Jae will have been weird for a nothern lord to call his child like that, even a bastard.

Gon and Mon, will you call your child like that? Don't forget, you're the Warden of the North, a Stark one of the oldest family in the North with a lot of traditions.
"Yes, this is my bastard son, Mon, from the faroff lands of South America"

I've always toyed with the thought of his name being Jacaerys or Jaehaerys. Jacaerys Velaryon rode his dragon to the north to acquire allies through the Pact of Ice and Fire (which a Targaryen princess would marry into the line of Cregan Stark, but it never happened). Also rumored is that his dragon, Vermax laid eggs in the crypts at Winterfell, but was disregarded by the maester. Would be cool to see a Targaryen princess (Dany) marry into the line of Cregan Stark (Lyanna is Jon's mother). *adjusts tinfoil*
It is Aegon Targaryen. I know people don't wanna believe it. But it is what it is :P
  
Lyanna is definitely not saying Jaehaerys or Aemon in that scene.

Cersei running a 2 minute kilometre, smashing the current record of 2:28. 

A diet of wine and incest, that's the secret to great athleticism hey.. 
Well the author should get their facts checked.  Cersei doesn't give anyone a head start, especially not Tyrion. 
Bonus Question:

f) Where do whores go?
>Cersei and her brother Tyrion decide to drink an entire jug of wine in one sitting. Cersei and Tyrion are both alcoholics, but Cersei is in a bad mood and has prepared a monologue, giving Tyrion a head start. Their drinking averages are shown in the graph below." 

>A) How much of a head start did Tyrion get?
>B) How much does Cersei usually drink?
>C) How much does Tyrion usually drink? 
>D) For what length of time will each alcoholic lead? For what length of time will they tie? 
>E) Explain the significance of being victorious in this contest of drinking and insults. 

FTFY; A foot race isn't the kind of competition Lannister siblings compete in. 
a) 100m  
b) 8m/s  
c) 6m/s  
d) Tyrion wins for t<50s (d<400m). Cersei wins for t>50s (d>400m).  
e) The answer to (a) is Tyrion's constant coefficient (minus Cersei's constant coefficient, which is zero). The answer to (b) is the slope (linear coefficient) of Tyrion's equation. The answer to (c) is the slope of Cersei's equation. The answer to (d) is the intersection of the two equations.
It's annoying me that Tyrion starts at 100m at t=0 rather than Cersei staying at d=0 for a short period. Perhaps my definition of head start is wrong?
Just to be clear: are these actual names in America? (I'm German) 
She would never give tyrion a head start
This is common with some textbook publishers. They use names from pop culture in an attempt to make the question more interesting to the reader. 
Tyrion came up a little short. 
Rickon in question 10
That was in my grade nine math textbook. I did that exact question last year. Good ol' Canadian math 
I wonder if there's an equation in there where R+L=J.
Ah some good ole grade 9 slopes.
No fair, he's only got little legs. 
Ontario grade 9 ?
I had a textbook in my recent college experience that had Kate Austen and Jack Shephard from Lost in it. 
I don´t feel like Cersei is the kind of person to give someone a headstart.... especially not Tyrion.
I've seen this before too. It was in the Principles of Mathematics 9 textbook published by McGrawHill 
The Great Lannister Footrace is now canon.
Tyrion has shorter legs. I'm  sure she gave him a head start just to humiliate him even more.
I originally thought you were saying no  spoilers in the textbook. Couldn't help but wonder how the hell you'd do that.
I'm just assuming there's an extra credit question that asks: What is the complete jackass and honeycomb joke?
Plot twist, OP is the teacher and did this to get Karma on Reddit.
Haha, when I was a programming teacher I used GoT names all the time in my examples.
Ahaha wow
It makes me slightly uncomfortable when my lecturers do this. Maybe it's because my mind tends to wander, I'd prefer generic names.
This question just brings me back to the days..when I would blankly stare at questions like this, barley comprehending or trying. At least I now know 95 % of what is actually taught and tested translates to zero in real life anyway. 
You were assigned a math textbook from 2006? My profs liked to pull the shit where textbooks were always current so they weren't free online yet. 
Nah.. i dont think so.   Anyone who knows anything about GOT knows Cersei would never give Tyrion a head start..
This bothers me that the 0 time is when cersei starts and not when Tyrion starts


Edit, also it bothers me that the logic completely breaks the graph. Tyrion, as fantastic as it would be, did not simply teleport 100 meters 
f) Does Tyrion run the race himself, or does he use a proxy?
I don't think Cersei would give Tyrion a head start 
I see what he did with tyrion 'head'. Ha!
TIL The lannisters are olympic medalists 
Varys will outrun everyone at lightspeed
this obviously doesn't take into account the speed of Little Finger's teleporter
F) Cercei allows Tyrion to waddle ahead while she has the Queens Guard rain death from the heavens and sip wine with a chilling smirk
Tyrion would know the answer,  because you know,  he drinks,  and knows things.  
a) 100m

b) 8m/s

c) 6m/s

d) Tyrion wins for t < 50 Cersei wins for t > 50 tie at t = 50

e) The solution is of the system is at what time they tie.
Actually I know a few of science fiction and fantasy fans. Yet they are probably more on the casual side, like myself (Mostly reading, watching and playing the more popular things).

Well everything is part of some (sub) culture. 
I hate math (sort of) but I am suddenly super interested in this problem.

The one flaw? Cersei would never give Tyrion a head start...
no, this is clearly a random chance, Cersei and Tyrion are really common names you know ^^^^/s
Sounds fake as fuck. Cersei would never give Tyrion a head start. Obviously the writer of this problem is a fake fan. Shame!
Please do not call them that.
Must be a coincidence. GoT came out in 2011. 
When I started reading these books in the early 2000s, about a decade since the first one was published, nobody would talk to me about them. Then all of a sudden it's a show and NOBODY WILL SHUT UP ABOUT THEM!?!!
This might explain it:
http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Fosterage
Not sure but Jon Arryn was probalay seen as a good and honorable man. Also a good tactician.  Its pretty common in Westeros as a sign on friendship to send your son to another ruler. It also teaches them about another part of Westeros and can be a good part of their education.
Fostering is like medieval ambassadors, they represent a country or house and are there to strenghten relationships with the other house

>Why did Rickard send his middle child away from Winterfell to be raised by another man?

Look up Southern Ambitions. Preston Jacobs did a series about it and the theory pops up from time to time around reddit. 

Basically, Rickard had plans outside of Northern politics.  
In a feudal society, noble families often sent sons to foster with allies, friends or families to which they owed fealty. The purpose was to remove the child from a family environment where love or concern could negatively effect his training and upbringing. The child started as a page to the foster mother learning manners and social and cultural skills and then as a squire to the foster father, who taught him leadership, management and weapons skills.
A ward was an orphan from a noble family. The family to which the ward's family owed fealty or a higher Lord (like a Duke) or even the King, would take charge of their security and raise them while they were minors, during which time, any lands or wealth of the orphan's family would be managed and any income generated enjoyed by the ward's protectors. Once the ward reached their majority, they would inherit full control of their family's wealth and lands. One important power held over a female ward was the authority to negotiate a marriage, which would be done to secure the loyalty of another family owing fealty to the ward's lord or to make an alliance.

I love it.
You're right, it does sound silly but it is also a great idea and will probably be done sooner or later.  I think the only issue would be what kind of tone would it have, i.e. funny like the Monty Python shows or serious like a Phantom of the Opera.  If they could get a more modern Hamilton vibe going that could be pretty, pretty, pretty good.

On a side note, (fair warning:  once you start doing this you can't stop) every time you turn on the radio, try to picture what GoT character would be singing it.  A while back the Hello song by Adele came on and I thought, "I could see this song being called 'Kat and Ned.'"  Well shiat.  Now I do it with every song.  "Sucker for Pain?"  Ramsay or Baelish.  "Dream On by Aerosmith?"  Bran.  For what it's worth, there are quite a few songs that fit one of Robert's scorned lovers or Littlefinger's whorehouse.  Again, once you start you can't stop.

Its an interesting theory. But some if not all of the evidence used is almost always in relation to Lyanna and Jon...

For it to be a literal God being poisoned beneath the crypts, I feel would be too big of a addition to the story this late on for the show. Potentially still an option for the books but not by a whole lot more.

A dragon could be possible though.

Though overall, I think the crypt scenes were almost always used in relation to Lyanna and Jon's parentage. And acted as a hiding place for some of the younger Starks.

Was there an event concerning The Others that took place while there were no Starks in Winterfell? It was so long ago that I can't keep track of the timeline, but did the Wight attack at Castle Black happen after Bran and Rickon fled?
Draken? Kragon?
I didn't know Cthulhu fans were a thing.

I'd watch the ever loving shit out of it. Can you imagine the battles between the different Emperors currently fighting for control over Yi Ti
To make this possible GRRM would probably have to put a lot of time into the production of it to really feel like it belongs in the world of ASOIAF, because if they let D&D write for it, I really don't feel like it'd have the same feel to it. That doesn't sound like good plan either, as I'd rather have the next two books before he dies than a mini-series about a place of which we know very little of compared to the rest of the known world.



EDIT: Don't get me wrong, I would totally be up for watching this if it ever were to be made.

Yi To spin-off? Nah. Dune.
yeah it's really interesting because we don't know a lot about what happens in the far east; particularly asshai.

Wont happen. Other storylines surrounding his have been given to oher characters.

Jon Conolly is now Mormont.

Young Griff himself, seems to be rolled into Dany. This can be reinforced by Varis interesr in Dany, when in the books it was interest in Young Griff.
I always found that storyline even in the books to be way out of left field so no.

It's not a mistake. The show shortened the line so within show lore Jahaerys II was skipped.
I believe the show doesnt include Jahaerys
The show cut out a big part of the Targaryen family tree, for simplification purposes I think. They do that with a lot of the stuff from the books. 

They also cut out a lot of the  Umbers, the Karstarks, the Mormonts, they love shrinking family trees.

"followed", but not "immediately followed". still fits.

Because of the ages of the actors and the fact that we can have 13-15 year old mothers (sexually active characters) in the book and not the show it needed to be condensed to make it more believable, morally suitable to a general audience.

Aemon would appear old... impossibly old if he was Dany's great great great uncle and not just her great great uncle.

Or imagine it this way. In the story from time to time Aemon acts as a mentor to Jon, his great great great nephew on the show. But if it was in the books in which all characters are having kids at a younger age, going off to the wall or to war at a younger age, he is Aemon's great great great great Nephew... Which is hard to believe by a general audience where 99% of people do NOT meet their great great great great uncle.

Well I honestly think jon is more wolf than he is dragon despite his targaryan father. The man is more like Ned stark than any of Ned's other children. 
He is called half targ maybe because targs have a history of going full targs.
Like targ+targ.
He is not that and also is raised by Starks.
Full targaryens are born from two targaryen parents since they were all inbreeding / incest and stuff.

therefore jon is only half targaryen.

also his hair is black and not white. 
He is half stark half targaryen, not full targ. First mistake. Second mistake is that you didn't took into account that he grew up as a stark with the other children. He is a wolf himself. 
So without a secret wedding reveal he is still just Jon Snow, full bastard and not targ or stark.
Ummm.
He is a BASTARD. and you know this word is not an insult anymore. Its more like compliment. At least for me. 
Just the thing that Ramsey is a bastard makes me sick
Same, the guys a Targaryen, can we please stop this people it's starting to get to me.

Robb Stark is half Stark but it never comes up because he is a Stark by birth and is given his father's family name.

The comparison doesn't work. Jon is "half" Stark, and literally half Targaryen but he was raised as a bastard to Ned and so his parentage is always of question.

And as for looks, that doesn't really matter. Rhaegar and Elia's Aegon looks more Targaryan but Rhaenys looks more Dornish but they WERE both Targaryens by name.

Jon was raised by Starks and so follows their culture and customs. Whether he is more Stark than Targaryen doesn't matter because of the environment he was raised in.

Jon Snow, the White Wolf - the Black Dragon
They weren't married..
The Dragons are with you, young Snow. But you are not a Targaryen yet. *heavy breathing*
...He's not full anything. He's a bastard.
well it's probably because most targaryens are full incest blood of the dragons while jon is the result of two people with genetics that are actually different
Oh, I understand what you're saying. But what you're talking about is in a legitimate birth, for a true born son. If he is not a true born son of Rhaegar then he remains a bastard. 
We call Robb Stark a Stark cause both hes mother and father are Starks. Cate was Tully but she married Ned so she got a Stark title while Lyanna wasnt married to Rhaegar so Jon cant be called as a full Targaryen.
My house's sigil would be a chicken on a checkered green and white background like this: http://i.imgur.com/cQDrMvH.jpg. 
House Giantsbane. Technically sworn to the Starks but we kind of keep to ourselves. Sigil is a burly man ripping another man's throat out with his teeth. House words, idk, maybe "Happy Shitting".
House 208327 would be sworn to House Manderly in the North, somewhere between White Harbor and Moat Cailin. We would be loyal to both Manderly and Stark, but nowhere near as earnest as our liege lords. Our sigil would be a leafless white tree (not a weirwood) on a navy field. 

I don't know what our words would be. 
Id just use my actual family crestand our apparent motto: (not 100% sure it actually translates, gaelic is a bitch)

"First Into The Fight"
I'm torn because I really love the targaryens but I've always identified more with the northern houses. Probably somewhere in the north near Winterfell.

For house words I'd probably pick "the pack survives" from Ned, to emphasize the importance of reliance on one another and the pack mentality. 

For a sigil I would pick 4 or 5 black wolves in a circle on a white field, in relation to the ties to the Starks. 

No clue what I would pick for a name
House Veridian of the Lonely Light would be a small noble house sworn to House Farwynd. Based on one of the smaller, less prominent islands under control of the Iron Islands, they're way, WAY behind when it comes to current news, as information doesn't travel as fast to their House. Hell, they probably still thing the Targaryens are in charge. 
They'd have an odd tradition where they'd pick a single member of every family to send off into the Sunset Sea, believing that there's someplace unexplored far west of Westeros. No sailors return, and those that did never reached any land beyond the Lonely Light, or at least didn't come back to talk about it. 


I really like the Ironborn. 
My house name would be my last name,sigil would be a yellow two headed eagle on blue background,our words would be " Into the fray " and we would be sworn to House Stark.
Mine would be a powerful Vassal house to the Tyrells.

Perhaps a failed rebellion by the Hightowers, a new house is named the Lord of Oldtown.

The lands entitled to Oldtown are immensely powerful.
House goodman , the purple Cobras and we will ROCK you
A modified version of House Dondarrion. I made a cool storyline and everything. Sigil would look a little different (yellow lightning bolt - so the house colors are black and yellow to show loyalty to House Baratheon). My nickname would be the Lightning Lord. Family sword is a Valyrian steel sword named "Bolt."
House Seilg, located in the North and loyal to the Starks. Our sigil would be a field of grey with a sleeping shadowcat in a snowstorm. "From the calm comes a storm" is our motto. We are a quiet house, experts in mediation. That of course puts us at great risk in this world, so we make up for it with our network of spies and assassins. Our enemies, for the most part, wouldn't know we were adversaries. And if we reveal that fact, it is only if we are prepared to bring the full might of House Seilg.  The Lord of the house is referred to as the Shadow Lord.

My house Sigil would be a Cobra on a sand dune. We would be a minor house sworn to the Martels. Our lands are In the desert Northeast of Sunspear. We had been loyal to the Targaryans during Roberts rebellion.  
House Flood of the Riverlands. My family name is Flood so I like that and our sigil is a wolf just like our real life sigil. Except the wolf would be blue on a red background.
My last name already has a crest but it's way too complicated to be a GoT sigil. Plus my last name is too similar to an actual house in the series so I'll just make a new one. My house would be House Keegan( a variation of my actual last name) and it's sigil would be black eagle facing forward in a swooping motion with its wings spread out on a green background, and our motto would be "Flying Higher". We would be sworn to House Arryn. 
My family on both sides have served the military. Dads side my father, grandfather, and his father all served as well as my grandmother's brother. Believe it goes farther back but not certain. Mother's side my aunt and uncle were both in the service. 

My father and grandfather taught me archery and fishing as a boy.

We'd probably be hunters in the north and be bannermen for our liege lord. 

For a sigil a group of flying arrows on a green background. Words be something like, "Our honor flies like arrows, straight and true"
House: Vargort.

Banner/Sigil: a black Beast (mix between lion and wolf) over a yellowish background with three thick lines symbolising a plowed field.

Words: With ferocity we succeed, with might we triumph

Liegelord: Ser Edmure Tully of Riverrun.

Lord: Lord Jehred Vargort, the scarred wolf. 
Have always associated with the Starks. All the extended family is in Florida while we're in New York so I'm always around telling them how they don't know real cold. Honor and love for family are big in hispanic families. The surname Lopez (my last name) even means from the wolves so the sigils would match
That was a different walker.
They die if struck by dragon glass/obsidian/Valyrian steel. Sam kills one with a shard of dragon glass in an earlier season. I've never seen the same one come back. I know which WW Jon kills in Hardhome, but what do you mean by the WW killing the savages? Do you mean the wildlings at Hardhome during the same episode? I can probably find images of both of them if you could be more specific about the second one you're referring to. 
Ian Whyte portrayed the white walkers in that episode I believe. 

Other than the Night King, they probably change few visual aesthetic items when the actor is switching from White Walker to White Walke. It was a different white walker but they probably didn't change their looks enough to make it obvious it was a different white walker.
Twins
those are actually different individual white walkers. i could understand confusing them for being the same because they basically are. most of them are the result of the infant sons of craster being turned into walkers through children of the forest magic. they have a lot of the same genetics too because of all the inbreeding craster had with his daughters through the generations which means all the walkers are uncles, cousins, and brothers with eachother at the same time. so yeah i'd say the only one of the white walkers with a distinguished look is the original night king himself....(thats the guy who reanimated all the dead bodies and made eye contact with jon as he was sailing away)
Many white walkers. Not the same one

I would say that while it is better in the books, the arc isnt completely diferent, just better written. Also qeep in mind that in the books Arya didnt leave the faceless man yet.
I enjoyed Arya with the Faceless Men much more in the books. It goes more in depth and is better written. The TV show is ahead of the books so her time with the Faceless Men could end differently in the books.
It's more of the same: meandering. 

Just with less action.

Most of the problems with Aray's S6 storyline come from D&D sacrificing logic and common sense for the sake of making it look more "cinematic". The books don't have this problem, so you shouldn't see any significant difference in quality between Arya's storyline and the rest of the book(s).
My guess is he aligns with cersei. Seems like at the end of season 6 she became queen but had no real allies. So I think they set up Randyl in season 6 to join up with cersei. Probably euron to 
I don't think he is going to get his own story arc. In the show I believe they end up putting him on the small council during Cersei's imprisonment. He is a very capable military commander and is simply dissapointed that his son is a wimp. I don't think he is a bad guy in the sense that he is evil, he is more like the drill seargeant in Full Metal Jacket. He has dedicated his life to military matters and resents his son for being a coward. Honestly it does not make much sense that Sam turned out to be such a pussy with a father like Randyl. Cant really blame the guy for wanting to entrust the house to somebody more worthy.He is sworn to house Tyrel so my guess is that he withdraws along with the rest of the Tyrel vassals when and if the Lannisters and Tyrels are no longer allied. In the book I think he is going to be dealing with Connington and the Golden Company.  
In my opinion Randyll is a minor antagonist and will be killed by the Hound. And here is why: 
Sam and the Hound share huge similarities in their family histories, which led me to the conclusion that Heartsbane is destined for the Hound. 

I guess that Sam will leave Oldtown soon and head north to reunite with Jon. By ship would be faster, but since he is extremly seasick he'd probably rather travel on horseback. He'll bring Heartsbane, too, because Jon will need every single valyrian steel sword. But Randyll will be after him, and I imagine a scenario in which Sam is hunted down in the woods by Randyll, and run into Sandor and the Brotherhood. Sandor saves his life (atonement for killing Mycah and a story circle about "hunting accidents" for both characters). 
Sam convinces the brotherhood to follow him north (or at least convinces the Hound) and leaves Heartsbane to the Hound because he is one of the very few who can wield it, and after saving Sam's life he'd truly deserve it.

I think there's a good chance that Randyll will eventually confront Sam at the citadel. The way he had put so much emphasis on how important the family sword is to him, it would seem a bit naive to think he wouldn't go to any lengths in order to get it back. 

So, that being said, I'm imagining a scene when where he shows up and threatens to kill Gilly if Sam does hand over the sword. A struggle ensues and Sam is nearly killed by his father until Gilly uses the sword to kill Randyll. This leads to Sam being forced to leave the citadel before he can complete his training.

I dont see him joining with cersei as others have said.

If you have seen the got lore videos,it really gives a different spin on why he made sam join the nights watch.As for what the show does with him i suspect he will control the high garden forces and keep a bit role 
One thing I consider when we see a new house is, "how are those castle walls going to fare against a prolonged zombie attack."  I remember thinking that the Tarlys had a  pretty good set-up, though nothing beats Old Town.  Between their fortification and archery skills, their story might be how well they hold up?  I also found it interesting that Gilly talked about the ladies of Umber being hunters, but that will probably be something we only see play out up north.  On a side note, wasn't Gilly a good hunter?  I remember her having a rabbit once and just being generally resourceful.  I like the idea that she will end up back at the Tarlys and be some kind of useful hero (and Randyll eating his words), but that's probably wishful thinking.

I'd like for him to serve as high commander of Targarean forces. Basically be Eisenhower.

Robert's paternal grandmother was a Targaryen (who was Daenerys's great aunt), giving him a blood claim to the throne
Even if you don't consider the bloodline argument at all, Robert was the best option even if you don't consider the fact that he was next in line to the throne through blood. The three options were Robert, Ned, and Jon Arryn. Jon Arryn was an old man with no heir who wouldn't live long enough to see another son to maturity to ensure a peaceful transition once he died, and the other option was Ned who has the complete wrong personality, heritage, and religion to be the king. Robert was the most acceptable candidate 

Edit: another targaryen wasn't put on the throne because Rhaegar was already dead, Aegon was "killed", leaving only Viserys who was I think only eight years old at the time and preparing to run to essos. 
He had targaryen blood + Aegon gave the stormlands to the baratheons. But yea its a stretch and he no true claim. But it have people and him an "official" and "technical" reason to support him. 
Robert had Targaryen blood
There was no one else really suitable by bloodline and supporting the Rebels. It couldn't have been Ned, because he's a northerner and a worshipper of the Old Gods. It couldn't have been Jon Arryn, he's quite old, and although he, I assume, is probably quite intelligent, his low fertility rate would almost end the Royal House of Arryn, like in the canon. Also, Robert himself is related to Targaryen blood, his ancestor, Ormund Baratheon, Lord Paramount of the Stormlands and Hand of the King (before his death in the War of the Ninepenny Kings.) married Rhaelle Targaryen and before the rebellion, he was already sixth in line for the throne. So Robert, although a drunkard and a quite terrible king, had bloodright and old enough to be king. It didn't matter anyways, Robert wouldn't even rule, as stated many times, it was the Small Council, mainly Jon Arryn and sometimes, Stannis Baratheon, ruling the Kingdoms. Like how Tywin Lannister was 'ruling' the Kingdoms during the Mad King's period.
Actually according to actual inheritance law he is the rightful heir of you consider dany and viserys disinherited by way of exile. With the entire Baratheon line dead, the crown should pass to the child Lord Monterys Velaryon, whose father died serving stannis on the black water, who I believe are the next closest family with Targ ancestry.

Well it comes down to there is 4 choices at the end.Jon Arynn,Hoster Tully,Ned stark,Robert Baratheon,it would only be  one of the leaders of the great 4 houses who rose in rebellion.It has nothing to do with Targaryen blood or else Viserys would of been crowned with someone being his regent.

The best choice for the realm would of been Tywin but he came to late to the rebellion.But of the 4 choices i guess it becomes Roberts rebellion because he slew Rhagear at the trident and was a great knight,but in reality its Jon Arynns rebellion,it was him who had 2 of the great lords within his power,the rebellion lived or died on his decision of whether to call his banners or do as Aerys ordered.
In the books when cersei is talking to Ned she says it would have been called Eddards rebellion had he just sat upon the iron throne because Robert was not able to ride to Kings Landing after the Trident
Can you imagine Lysa Tully as Queen?
That's good! To me Nikolaj coster-walda is particularly spot on . And always Charles dance. 

Sophie turner and Kit Harrington have gotten noticeably better since the first season. 
Mance Rayder felt miscast to me. I pictured someone more charming and roguish. 
Who do you think are the worst actors?
They're all good but the ones that nailed their roles to perfection are:  
  
- Tywin  
- Joffrey  
- Tyrion  
- Drogo  
  
(Funny thing is I hat the lannisters as well but my god they were perfect).  
  
Viserys was pretty good as well.
Sorry for the semi tl:dr, I was going to post a similar topic but you beat me to it so I'll rant here.

David Bradley (Walder Frey) was amazing, particularly in the Red Wedding. There was a scene where he was watching the carnage while gulping wine that only lasted a few seconds but everything you needed to know about his character you could see on his face and his expression - greedy, murderous, cunning. It was PERFECT but he doesn't get enough love.

Alfie Allen for playing multiple roles and pulling them all off and making you feel sympathy for a very unlikeable character, Charles Dance, Lena Headey, Aidan Gillen, Sophie Turner, Donald Sumpter, Sean Bean, Conleth Hill, Liam Cunningham for much-appreciated subtlety, and Iwan Rheon for his The Joker/Hannibal Lecter Ramsay. Even for small roles there have been really great performances ie Amrita Acharia (Irri) and Ben Hawkey (Hot Pie), Esme Bianco (Ros).

For such a huge cast they pretty much nailed it with most of their decisions. Even most of the actors who don't particularly stand out only don't because they aren't playing very meaty characters (I are Serious Jon, this is my serious face).

The weakest link is Emilia Clarkeson. There isn't one scene she's in where she isn't obviously acting and it's so distracting I have to fight to not skip over her scenes. (one hand raised, crazy eyes).The casting directors have done an amazing job with everyone except her and it's one of the biggest roles! Pisses me off.


I really like the casting choices for just about everyone! One choice that really bugged me, was that they changed Daario Naharis..obviously he is a bit toned down from the description of him in the books, but I thought Ed Skrein, who played him when he first shows up, was pretty awesome. He just had a very unique face and way of speaking, and stood out as an intriguing character right away. I'm assuming he was just busy filming Deadpool and couldn't sign a contract. The current actor, Michiel Huisman, is a great actor, but to me he looks like such an average guy, he just doesn't sell that character nearly as well for me.

The guy who plays the Hound is incredible and absolutely love him. I just don't like how the actors age caused plot lines to get cut in the show. They really tried their best to keep the complicated relationship of Sansa and The Hound in the beginning of the show. But sadly they had to cut several key scenes between the two because it would have just been too *much*. (Sophie was maybe 15-16 and he was pushing 40.) They even cut out a scene after they shot it because they didn't want to ruffle any feathers. 

I won't lie I'm a bit biased because I am a bitter Sansan shipper. I wanted the unkiss, singing, Hound tears, and pinning onto the bed.. But yeah... I completely understand why they cut that out in the show. 
The whole Lannister family was so spot on for me, they honestly couldn't have picked any better. Also Petyr Baelish was exactly how I imagined him to be.
Michael Shannon is a waste.
The sexiest man in Westeros.

Shut up, you all know it's true.

He makes the best videos. His Jon Snow White Wolf video is the best tribute video I've ever seen.

Zurik23M >>>> TheGaroStudios
Damn you found the cure for Jorah's greyscale. He's going to become the perfect destruction machine.
The Stonemen appear to keep their muscle and strength, so I feel like they might have an advantage over the frail and bone-like army of the dead. Then again, wights tend to work together to do things so who knows.
Greyscale is a disease. Wights and White Walkers are immortal, with some being thousands of years old, so its safe to say that they are immune to disease, greyscale included.

Stonemen are infected humans. Any human can be turned into a wight, no matter what diseases they have, and any wight has a weakness to fire.

Therefore, a stoneman should be able to turn into a wight and catch fire like any other wight. Wights shouldn't be able to get greyscale.
Stonemen feel pain, the dead don't and can fight on even after losing a limb
A white walker with grayscale is a fucking terrifying thought.

A wight could take on a thousand stonemen, a walker could take on maybe half a stoneman. 
It's possible that Jon simply hanged the ringleaders and spared the others. The three he hanged were officers, and Olly was simply personal.
Maybe he forgot

he was just reseurrected, geez give him a break
I rewatched that scene twice to see. Only six people stabbed him so he definitely only hanged the ones who actually stabbed him.
I'm pretty sure it was only 6 people

Edit: just went and checked, only 6 guys stab him

I'd surmise it goes to a Lion with Quyburn proclaiming Cersei of House Lannister first of her name titles titles... Queen.
It will change to the Lion. We saw this with Winterfell changing from Bolton to Stark in S6E10.
It'll change to a lion
Yea it will change to a lion since Cersei has no baratheon blood. Also she was proclaim Cersei Lannister Queen of the seven kingdoms :D 
It should change to Lion if the show producers won't forget about it ([like the fact that jamie had long hair when he killed the mad king](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=201Meq_-M2c))

I think this has been brought up multiple times, and I am terrified of it! if EVERYTHING boils down to "lol Bran went back in time and did it" it will be a MASSIVE let down, awful story telling and just an overall SHITTY way to end a series that is already 25 years in the making.

It is a decent theory and I like it for several reasons but also dislike it for several reasons.

One thing we know is that Bran CANNOT change the course of the past/present/future.

Bran being Bran the Builder is a little far fetched.  
I do like the idea that either 3ER or Bran may of had some hand in making Aerys lose his shit.

But to what degree is the question. Bran was able to warg into Hodor at a young age to help keep Hodor at the door at the present. 
So with enough focus Bran CAN warg into people.

And though Bran is a main character, he is not one of the big three leading characters (Jon, Tyrion, Dany), and this might prove to be underwhelming for their story arcs.

But overall I would like it if they DIDN'T try to pass everything off as Bran's time warg abilities.
It would be cool if we found out that Bran really was manipulating situations the whole time but I wouldn't want that to be the main conclusion of the show. 
I am more convinced that Eddard Stark is the god of death 
I hate it to bits .
Ygrette, Grenn and Pyp?
Grenn was pretty important. And wun-wun also I'd say Ramsey counts as battle. Stannis was left for dead during the battle that has to count. I'd also argue Jeor was during a battle even though it was a rebellion. I understand what you mean but I think we'll get our Rhaegar soon enough 
Maybe not in the show, but quiet a few get killed while in battle.     
   
Rodrick Cassel gets killed in battle against Ramsey instead of being beheaded by Theon.   
Jon doesn't even seem Ygritte until she's pretty much dead when she attacks the wall.    
A few of Davos' sons get killed in Blackwater Bay Battle and in the show the single son dies.   

Well a lot of the source material  (English history) has important people not dying in battle.

The son of Stephen of Blois died not in battle and that led to his opponent's son to become King after him. Henry V and Edward IV died of disease and Henry VI died in prison, and all three of those kings were in massive wars with either France or opponents to the throne.

The  again some important people did die in battle. Like others have said, Grenm, Ygritte, and Pyp died in battle. Stannis did also.
Oberyn Martell died in a pretty epic battle.
You can't really give an important character a send off during a large scale battle though. 
If you think about it, it makes sense that none of the great warriors would die in normal battles.  They are great warriors after all and trying to kill them using the skill they are best at is a really dumb way to go about it.  Why would you attack your opponents strengths?  You go for their weaknesses because that gives you better odds of success.  And warriors weakness tend to be family, honor and lack of political savvy and an unsuspecting nature when it comes to treachery from their own allies.  
*Are you calling Hodor a minor character?*
hmmm, Stannis died in a battle. Ygritte also died in a battle. You could call Hodors death for a battle, but its a stretch. But i can see your point, think Tormund should had died in the botb. 
In the show Ser Barristan dies in a battle, he takes out like 16 sons of the harpy by himself before being overwhelmed. Pretty badass actually! But still super disappointed that's the route they chose for him. He should still be alive IMO. I haven't read all the books but I'm pretty sure he's still alive if I remember correctly. I would have loved to see him lead Daenerys' army to retake Westoros! 
is anyone else pissed off about how they took out the blackfish this season. 
I was so excited to see him come back and see that his badass ways got him to retake Riverrun but damn they cheated him our of an epic death. he realizes he's gonna die, takes out his sword to fight and we hear later in a status update that the blackfish died fighting instead of seeing it.

I haven't been that disappointed about a death being cheated since Barristans wimpy death.

I think the reason for this is that battle is very hectic, and most characters deserve more screen time and a "better death" I guess than a quick stab in the gut. Is that realistic? No, but I guess I like it that way.
That wordplay is insane

I think it was more Oberyn's poison that disfigured Gregor so badly (given that he somewhat resembles Joffrey's corpse) and Qyburn was simply unable to reverse the effects completely. Qyburn in the books is described as a necromancer and is associated with blood magic as well as anatomical science, so it seems that he either resurrected Gregor or brought him back from the brink of death.
Its intentionally left very vague. Whatever it was, it worked. In the books Qyburn takes many victims down to his lab and screaming can be heard for weeks on end. Gregor's, the Victims, any and all. Some believe Gregor is actually composed of different body parts a la Frankenstein, including the mind and/or head of Joffery.

EDIT: [Here](https://youtu.be/v9IO1_Qkjc0) is a great summery of it.
I think he is a Frankenstein type creature. The Martells were rather insistent on having the actual physical head delivered to them. It would be difficult to fake a head that size so I think his actual head has been removed and replaced with the head of another. It would make sense for him to have his head replaced with Joffreys given Joff's natural cruelty and likely devotion to his mother as Cersei's protector. Although decapitating a former King and taking his head probably would meet with some resistance from Cersei. All in all though it is clear he is the product of blood magic/ alchemy that Qyburn has been studying for many years.

Crossover episode with Walking Dead.
Dany. The frequent flier miles alone...
Gendry
It's Tyrion. He's like the glue to connect everyone in the series. He's been with Jon at Castle Black. Lannisters at KL, Arryns at Eyrie, Dany at Essos, Tywin at Harrenhal, etc. 
Maybe Jorah?
We're fogetting a big one, Melissandre and Euron have traveled very, very far east and west.
I think someone actually tracked this before. I know there's a website somewhere that shows where each character is at over the course of the series and I think it's Tyrion. From kings landing to Winterfell to Castle black to KL to Pentos to Mereen. Closest would probably be Arya or Yara. 

Actually now that I think about it, in the show Yara went from Pyke all around Westeros through the river by White Harbor, all the way back, then all the way to Mereen. 
My guess would be Euron, but with some characters it's hard to tell because we don't know where they have been.
Melisandre for sure, shes 400 years old and came from Asshai to Westeros, its literally a cross to almost all know world.
Littlefinger makes his way around too. Eerie to the capital to the Riverlands to the North. 
Dany, arya and varys 
People have forgotten about Yara, she's sailed from Pyke, all the way around Westeros, all the way back and then all the way to Mereen.

Glumshanks
Varys did not go back to Mereen after Dorne. This has been discussed quite a bit on this sub- there are Martell and Tyrell sigils on the ships we see at the end, showing that the fleet met up with Dany on her way to Westeros. No need for Varys to go all the way back east by himself.

Anywhere Varys has gone, Tyrion has gone too with the exception of Dorne. However, Tyrion has also gone to all the places you mentioned like the Wall, Winterfell, and the Eyrie. I'd say Tyrion wins this one hands down.
Dany, from Pentos across the Dothraki Seas, through The Red Waste to Quath to Slavers bay back to The Dothraki Sea and back to Merren again.
Technically speaking, the CotF or White Walkers. Thousands of years creates tons of mileage.
Tyrion - Winterfell to The Wall to Kings Landing to Eastos to Westeros
It's littlefinger. He's gone everywhere and back maybe 3 times. In season 6 he went from the wall to the vale to winterfell in like 3 episodes.
Let's see, Arya is one to consider, down from Winterfell to Kings Landing, from KL to Harrenhal, then Harrenhal roundabout to the twins, then back across her own path to the Eyrie. then back south a little bit to Saltpans, then straight across the Narrow Sea, then back, then north to the Twins.

Danaerys is worth some consideration, from Volantis (or was it Pentos in episode 1?), to Vaes Dothrak then to Qarth, then to Astapor, then Meereen, then back to Vaes Dothrak, then back to Meereen then all the way across to Westeros.

but yeah, Tyrion and Varys seem like a good bet too.


Bran, he not only traveled way north of the wall but also traveled in time. I think he has traveled most and he is crippled. 
Euron Greyjoy. Guy traveled the entire world before he returned to Pyke.
I guess it depends on whether these are events that happen during the story of the show/books or before.

Euron, Tyrion, Varys, Dany, Jorah. Even Jaime has traveled quite a bit, sometimes as a prisoner.
arya did a bit of travel going from winterfell to kings landing then back toward winterfell but then yoren died and she went in circles around the riverlands and a bit of the eyrie. after that she sailed to braavos and back to the twins
Drogon. Or Tyrion if we're talking strictly human...
Danaerys
The historic bits always come across as almost high-fantasy, while the present day events in the show are much more grounded. Things are going to end up being embellished quite a bit with unreliable record-keeping, [S6] (#s "the Citadel thought fucking Jeor Mormont was still Lord Commander"). I'm sure the reality of what happened is much different from what they consider historic fact. 
Real history was recorded the same way for a long time.
And why is their technology still at basically the same level?
The impact of the seasonal cycle probably has something to do with the "slow" development of technology and society compared to Earth. Where Europe, the primary fountain of "modern" society and technology goes through three months of winter that effectively put a stop to most outdoor activities in a pre-Modern society, Westeros and Essos go through a winter lasting years, even a generation. To them, 8,000 years would be seasonally comparable to 800 years for us.
Also,  a society can atrophy and reach a state of equilibrium that maintains accepted customs and traditions. Egyptian society remained essentially unchanged for 1,500 years and that of China, for as much as 2,000. Ancient Egyptian society eventually collapsed and disappeared after multiple invasions and occupations. China's society only began to change from the external stimuli of multiple defeats by European incursions. 

Still, GRRM is writing fantasy, not history or anthropology, so you just have to expect and accept plot gaps.
This has come up in the books: it hasn't. Sam tried to calculate how old the Night's Watch was based on the number of Lord Commanders they'd had, and quickly realised that at most there had been something like 230 Lord Commanders (might be misremembering that) as opposed to the 999 which is the commonly held number.

It made tywin more humanized. Those scenes made me care about his character more. The fact tywin didn't know it was arya shows he still cared for people.


It helped to develop Tywin as a character in a way that was done quicker than in the book. He really hadn't seen much screen time up to that point. You get to see that Tywin can recognize talent in others and is not easily fooled by Arya as others are. He sees through her facade and her lies. It does serve to humanize Tywin in a way but it is more about showing his ability to read people. He is firm but just in the way he interacts with his underling. It shows that he is a capable lord and although he is stern he would not be the worst lord to serve under.   Roose Bolton in the books dreadful. He is constantly being leeched and is portrayed as cruel and quick to punsih. Roose is at least knows how to be a lord whereas his bastard is a cruel monster. Roose is not somebody you would want to be your lord and in comparison Ramsey is such a monster that he is incapable of being a lord.  
Thats one of the few things I thought the show did better than the books.  Shows you Tywin in a fatherly light and also how smart Arya is.  Was a nice touch.
George also said he wished he had thought to pair the two up on some scenes in the books.  It worked so well on screen.  The character dynamics were one of the best.
We hadn't seen much of Tywin up to that point, so it helped us get a feel for his character. Considering how important he would end up being and just how good the actor playing Tywin is, it just made more sense to give the scene to him. Its actually one of my favorite scenes of the second season, though it also didn't let us get to know Roose all that well. 
Book!Harrenhal was a clusterfuck that would have taken far too much time to explore and explain properly (i.e. why Arya doesn't hand herself over to Roose Bolton). In the show, pairing her with Tywin would give a chance to explore his character and give a unique way of conveying behind-the-scenes politics (Baelish). 

Both plotline have the same theme for Arya's character: becoming someone else

I myself am almost positive that the opening title sequence is being shown from the inside of a spherical object. Rather than the outside. As you mentioned...

What it means... if anything, I don't know.
I think it's supposed to be a map or globe, a very intricate one at that, being viewed by someone at the Citadel. If they address it all in the show I imagine it will be a quick shot of Sam (or perhaps another Maester) looking it over that will go without consequence, but will be a subtle nod and tie-in to the opening credit sequence. I think the reason it looks like we are seeing the map from the inside of a sphere is because Sam (or whoever) is looking at the map through [these lenses](https://youtu.be/Pdgm1JClpYE?t=53) causing a reverse fish-eye effect. During the credit sequence [the lenses can be seen](https://youtu.be/s7L2PVdrb_8?t=11) flashing in front of the map. The [chandelier-like thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7L2PVdrb_8) in the opening credits also matches [this thing](https://youtu.be/S6x2epcK5rU?t=41) further indicating that the opening credits are being viewed by someone at the Citadel. 

edit: formatting
One of the better Jon hype videos right here.

I liked the "Dragon Raised By Wolves" one a bit more but this is good too.

Jon Snow, the White Wolf - the Black Dragon.
Wow, I did not think of that... If it is a foreshadowing then perhaps Jon will survive the long night. Then again that's pox, not a giant army of frozen zombies and a zombie king with superpowers
Well I'd say it is a nice mirroring of his interactions with Melisandre. Basically a woman bringing him back to life by praying to the gods.
I like it. Nice catch, haven't heard it before.
Whoa...I never notice that small details before. Nice job pointing that out. Now I realize that Jon could very well be the living epitome of Syrio Forel's iconic quotes: "there is only one thing we say to Death: "Not today".
I think you're correct. It ALL means something, seriously how can it not? Dude is genius so I forgive the slow pace in publishing every time. One could write dissertations on all the allusions links webs foreshadowing yada yada 
Jon is defeating death since he was a baby xD xD The Gods be like off you go. You have loads of work to do down there still. Nice catch though.

Yup

These rhymes are incredible.

"Arya trains, plays, saves Lady Crane, slays the Waif, displays her face, escapes the Faceless, bakes, eviscerates a Frey and says she's Arya Stark."
HOW IS EVERYTHING RHYMING.

This is pretty hilarious.
 #NoYgrittes was fantastic. The offseason clearly has Alt Shift getting into creative mode.

Love the pauses between seasons. Dude's deadpan always serious demeanor is comedy gold here.
Can't wait for season 7.. I'll join the bears in hibernation.
i guess jorah isnt important :(
Reminds me of Yahtzee's [Zero Punctuation review of Wolfenstein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHnYFP73MKE)
OOO maybe some west world stuff next year! 
niceeee
This is simply perfect. 
That was pretty damn impressive, not only for the super quick recap but also the almost poetic way of doing it.

Back in 2017?! NOOOO
Did this sound like some weird Cake song to anyone else? 
Fucking Bad Pussy, hahaha. Looking forward to more Game of Thrones content next year.

Excited to hear they are gonna get into Westworld too, that will be amazing as well.
I really want alt shift to start tackling some of the past stories. Love to hear him do a dance of dragons or aegon the conquer.
Those last missing seconds could have used to drop some sick fire about hardhome but I ain't complaining.
Condensed into 5 minutes *of beautiful poetry*
Man I love Alt-Shift-X, I just wish he would branch out a bit more...                                
Not sure how popular this would be here, but I would love to see him do more Westworld videos, or even some epps on The Expanse, or Preacher...                     
Truth be told, I just love those shows and want to see more alt-shift-x videos.

I'm too high for this
For the lazy: (or maybe the not lazy)

Game of Thrones, Season 1-6, in 5 minutes.

Robert Baratheon rules the realm of Westeros.

He deposed the dragon dynasty and married a Lannister, Cersei,

who breeds a brood of bastards with her brother Jaime,

who breaks Bran's back to keep the secret.

Lady Cat captures Tyrion, falsely accuses him,

Lysa tries to make him fly but Bronn's blade excuses him.

Ned starts to see that the seed is strong, so he tries to tell Bobby

but he's gored by a boar cause of Cersei, so Ned tries to set shit straight, but Baelish

betrays him and Ned gets beheaded on the steps of Baelor's Sept.

Young Robb gathers the banners, battles south, and is crowned.

Arya trains then runs away, Sansa suffers Joff and the Hound.

While Jon joins the watch on the Wall, where winter is falling and wildlings are calling

and walkers are stalking and dead men are walking.

And Dany weds Drogo, her brother goes loco, crowned with gold - oh and Drogo dies too.

Dany raises a pyre and strides into fire and rises as the mother of dragons.

*dramatic pause*

Robb battles Lannisters, falls in love with Talisa -

Which breaks his oath to Walder Frey and he ain't bloody having that.

This is kinda cool I guess but it's not really what I follow Alt Shift for.

I love this guy
this was beautiful
That was actually pretty spot on.
Awesome!
I'm so ready for this show to come back on. Oh the long wait. How much longer?
Wow I loved that but not in the way I expected from Alt-Shift-X 
Totally unexpected and totally amazing. Seriously stellar work here. I gotta join his patreon. 
This is fuckin' poetry
ITT there's a lot of "I love alt shift x but..." Can I just say, I love alt shift x, no but. 
This was fucking awesome!!! Nice Job
If noone beats me to it, I will be singing this anamaniacs style, relatively, soon. 
Only thing that I look forward to 
I watched this pretty high last night.. got caught so deep into his rhymes..


I know he tried really hard but the rhymes are awful
I'm by no means a hip-hop fan, but someone really has to add some phat flows and make this into a rap song.
Alt Shit X is a better rapper then most of them out there.
Hey Ali Shift X,  when does the mixtape drop? 
Wow.

I love Alt-Shift-X, and always look forward to the videos, but this one is just awful. 

Way to much effort made to try to be funny/rhyme, but it falls short on both and is just tedious to watch. I didn't even finish it.
Not really an explanation of the plot as much as a recap meant only for people who already know everything that happened. The characters are barely explained, etcetera etcetera.

Davos' Fingers is my favorite. I also listen to Radio Westeros on occasion. 
[Game of owns](http://gameofowns.com)
The Light Of The Seven opening was the most haunting in the entire series across all seasons.

Don't need no meat pie to spoil this near perfect episode
Nah, it would be too obvious. Besides, Walder's sons were cooked up after the scene with Walder and Jaime, so canonically it wouldn't make any sense.

The charm around them right now is simply the mystery around them, also another reason why we get them in small doses each season. What the hell were they? Where did they come from? What did they do with Craster's infant sons? Why are they weak to dragonglass and Valyrian steel? Why are they invading Westeros? Can they speak the Common Tongue? Numerous questions have been popping up since Season 1, some are answered while some have yet to be. We might get a backstory when the series nearly ends
They do have an origin; they were created by the Children of the Forest to kill the First Men. As for their current motives - I assume they're still trying to do just that.

Well i think it gives a lot to know why they were made. But i think we will get more to know about them in the last two seasons. But yea up untill last season they played on the mystery of these creatures. 
Must everything be spelled out or explained? Why not have some things shrouded in mist or better yet not really axplained at all. The beuty of GoT is not having every thing given to you, some things you have been told is true is false, some things you have to figure out by yourself and somethings are never fully revealed. The Doom of Valyria is the coolest event in asoiaf and we know really *nothing* about it!
GRRM Has said that the answers to the White Walkers, aka Others, will come, and it will be far from black and white. [AltShiftX](https://youtu.be/Ih_ZAGCfMY0) does a pretty good summery of what the books, and most of the show, cover and gives some of his insight on them. 
Nonsense. If it has to be a "prince" then how can it be Ser Pounce?
Dont know if we are supposed to look so much in to the word prince. But Jon is still prince of the iron throne? not sure on the titles, but dont think the prince thing is so important. 
The prince who was promised and Azor Ahai are not necessarily the same prophecies,also as Aemon points out in book 4 or 5,its translated from valyrian and there pronouns were gender neutral.So the prince who was promised could easily be the princess who was promised,or it could be 2 people rather then one.

Oh and everyone eventually dies.....

Jon isn't a prince technically. His father, Rhaegar was the prince. Now, with all the evidences pointing out the Jon is the PTWP, I think Gendry has a strong case with it too.

His father was the king. He *may* be the oldest son of Robert so that'll make him the Prince technically. I don't know but I really feel Gendry has a big role to play with in the upcoming series. For a lowborn, he's smart and everything. In contrast to Jon, Robb was better than him as he said in the convo with Sam. That's considering both had the same training/background/people growing up.

I'm calling it. Jon won't die again in the series. As cheesy as it may be, I think he'll be on of the survivors in the series. Dany, Tyrion, and Sansa won't survive. You've heard it here first
Well the Lord of Light would be King. Everyone is beneath him and hence no king. So any man must be a prince 
I still think that Dany is "The prince that was promised" and that she will wed Jon Snow, only to die in the final battles of winter.  Jon will be left behind as the solemn King of the seven kingdoms, having lost almost all of his family, friends, and loved ones to War(as his uncle Eddard Stark also did).
The prince/princess that was promised prophecy doesn't necessarily pertain to the Iron Throne... or ANY Throne for that matter. I myself am adamant that Azor Ahai Reborn and TPTWP are to fulfilled by two different individuals. Jon and Dany respectively. 
gendry will be reforging valerian steele thats why hes important
There is the first episode, when all the places are labeled. I think it's the second or third scene in the series after they show the wall.

Also during the intro there's always the Winterfell text when it goes there.

So many explosions. Is Michael Bay directing season 8?

We heard so many variations of this prophecy with turn out or more likely taunting Dany. Dothraki were cruel to her people, that was her revenge. Basically, she said F U to Dany in a polite way.

What you say is true. But at the end of the day is a guy like Bronn EVER going to be satisfied? I see him as similar to Sandor, albeit they fight for massively different reasons, they were born for combat. 
In the books, he's already become Lord of Castle Stokeworth due to Cersei's attempts to kill him backfiring.
He just needs the bad poosi
When Cersei defeats Dany, she will give Bronn his pretty wife (Dany) and castle (Dragonstone)

He was promised a Lady, and a Lady will he get.
But consider this - if he was paid and lived happily ever after, we'd have never seen him again! Isn't it worth it to have some more incredible scenes featuring his wit? Scenes like him choking Pod near Riverrun...priceless!

#WHAT IS HYPE MAY NEVER DIE!
I hope Tyrion rides the hound into battle and they both kill the mountain.
Current level: FUCKING HYPE!!
I feel like Arya is going to kill the mountain, so if the bowl goes down I worry for the hound...maybe arya pulls a howland reed assist..
Using a scale that ranges from NO CHICKENS to EVERY FUCKING CHICKEN IN THIS ROOM I'd go with EVERY FUCKING CHICKEN.

None more hype
I think it's dropping a tiny bit because Sandor is going away from King's Landing.
Zero. I don't want Cleganebowl but I don't see it happening at all, considering Sandor is going North and there is no reason for FrankenGregor to go there. 
Westeros does not seem to have Chess, but it does have Cyvasse -- which is basically Westeros chess.
In the books there is Cyvasse, a board game with an almost similar concept with Chess, but different rules and pieces altogether
The more important question is do gambling games involving cards exist? Because I can't think of any examples in book or show, but Roose warned Jaime about overplaying his... position back when they were in Harrenhal.

Top Row Left to Right: Cersei, Margaery, Sansa, Jon, Jaimie, Robb, Bran

Middle: Joffrey?, Ghost, Tyrion

Bottom: Theon, Sandor, Arya, Dany, Drogo

I really can't tell who is next to Margaery for some reason. I want to say Sansa but the black hair? I don't know. Also not sure if that's Joffrey or not.
My God, I've never seen any of these. Especially posted here before. 10/10 originality. 
Bran with the Prof X shirt, you cheeky devil :)
Jaime's mo is disgusting 
I love the "Joffrey Sucks" tag behind Arya.
I love that Dany has a ferret <3
Who is that at the far right?
I appreciate the Nine Inch Nails sticker.
Does anyone have a source for this? I want to hang this on my wall
Jaime with a moustache changes *everything*.
I'm wearing the arya shirt right now
http://imgur.com/A0GcMfo
Just to Clarify this is not my work, this is Mike Wrobel. I put this up so people can see his work and appreciate what he's done. He is a fantastic artist

Who's the potato top level, 2nd from the left in the dress?
I looked at this picture clockwise starting in the upper left corner. So glad I did because the Hound the Theon were the fucking best. 
why is pau gasol in the photo wearing the letterman jacket?
MAKE THIS GAME OR I'M DONE 
No helicopter/dragon in top left 2/10
Sansa and Jaime are pretty weak, other than that it's great!
This is amazing, anyone else think the Hound should be holding some chicken?
Drogo looks like the bassist from Metallica 
nice touch with homer on the hound. well done!
Bran with the Prof X shirt. You cold OP

I feel kinda bad for the artist now, I bought a t-shirt with this design on aliexpress,
who is the gomer between Jon Snow and Tyrion?  I can't tell.
Where's the helicopter?
I need to play this game
They all seem seriously pissed by this arrangement.
**BEAUTIFUL**
What about the helicopter?
Who is just to the left of Jon

2/10 no mannis 
Mustache Jaime is hilarious. Such a pimp!    
    
    
    
Of course Drogo listens to KISS, \*chuckle\*.
So... why are Dany and Drogo on that poster? It's called "game of thrones **westeros*", those two are in Essos, not Westeros.
I'm trying to find a print of this to purchase, but I cannot :(
no helicopter or girl in bikini, not GTA
Theon with the hot dog. Perfectly subtle.
Mother of Ferrets!  Perfect.  

Now I want to see her riding a giant fire-breathing ferret into battle.
There should be a game like gta in westeros, i'd die happy.
Fantastic username!
Kit resembles Glenn, doesn't he? ;-)
Wow, this is very well done. So would you say, he lost the war even before the Red Wedding? How do you think the war would turn out if the Freys didn't betray him?
This was a great read.

In the end, if Robb had kept his vows to House Frey, never allowed his mother so close to his command that she could let Jaime go free, and never executed Lord Karstark, things would have gone down very differently. 

He should have allowed Edmure to be sieged successfully and Winterfell to remain sacked, and pursued an alliance once again with Stannis while he sacks King's Landing and Robb sacks Casterly Rock.

This is awesome. Thank you!
Just want to specify that Robb doesn't actually split his forces in half, he takes about 3000 horsed men and leaves Roose Bolton with about 20000 infantry, which is roughly equal to Tywin's host. That explains why Roose attacked Tywin.
Other than that it looks good.
Seems to me Tywin anticipiated him storming the westerlands and set up the westerlings to start the process that became him destroying his frey vows and setting up the red wedding.  That along with Edmure messing up his orders screwed everythinng up.
Very good read!  I love reading about historical military strategy and this does an excellent job of translating a fictional story to military strategy.  I do wish that Robb had considered the ramifications of his marriage and had an alternative (greater lordship, perhaps?) for Lord Frey.  
Having seen the show, that last sentence still sent chills down my spine.
Here is what I predict for Season 7:

King's Landing

Winterfell

The Wall

Dragonstone

Oldtown

Dorne/The Twins/Highgarden/Casterly Rock

Unless they plan on reducing the number of locations from six (like they did in Season 1)
The north! 
I'd be happy to see Dragonstone again. That was a cool set. I want to see Dany's Small Council around the Painted Table.
Casterly Rock as well 
Dragonstone and Old town 
I don't have many predictions but I really wish they would show all the main castles.
Casterly Rock, Storm's end, and Highgarden.
If they show those three I will be happy.

Oberyn, thought he had in the bag then pop 
Uhm, Margaery 100%. like wtf. WHERE DID IT COME FROM AND WHY. She had this build up, then boom. Literally boom.
Ned. After that I realized anything goes. 
Ned. I kept waiting for Robb or someone, anyone, to ride in and save him at the last minute. Even when the episode ended, I thought it was a trick. Killing off the (seemingly) main character in season 1? Shocking. 
Tommen, for sure, and the Tyrells in the finale. Before that it was Ned.
Myrcella. That was the first one I legitimately had no idea was coming. Others I knew from the books or spotted subtle hints leading up to it, but I had no idea Myrcella was going to go.
Hodor. As a book reader I knew most of the deaths that were coming, but Hodor last season was such a shock I burst out crying. Second most shocking was Barristan as he's still alive in the books.
after I realized how GoT worked, I would say Ser Barristan 
The Red Wedding.

It still makes my blood boil any time I rewatch that episode.
I know it's obvious but Robb and Catelyn Starks deaths shocked me the most. I just finished the show and the Red Wedding crushed me.
Roose Bolton's. 

Honestly I thought he was going to kill Ramsey. I really didn't see it going the complete opposite way.
Ned by far. No single death was nearly as surprising/shocking. Yes the Red Wedding was awful, cruel, diabolical, and super terrible to witness on film. But even if you didn't know the outcome, the whole episode really did give you an eerie "something isn't right about this" kind of feeling. Ned confessed his crimes, and Cersei the main antagonist in Season 1 had clearly agreed to the terms of their arrangement. After he made his "I'm a criminal" speech it seemed like he'd be off to the wall while a war would erupt around his absence.

But nobody, not even the characters in the show, expected Joffrey to go from a little whiny cunt to full blown psychopath. All the pieces were there, but it just seemed like Ned had wrapped up his failures in KL with a sentence to take the black. Annnnd he's decapitated.
Robb's, I mean I expected his death but not like that and not so soon. 
Lady, It made me realise that even the little wolves were on stake.
Tommen leaping from his window really got me, especially all the "Kings Landing" jokes afterwards :(
Ygritte
Jon's. he was my favorite character at the time 
Definitely Jon. I started watching at about Season 3 so I already knew about Ned otherwise that would have been #1. Also, my first time watching I didn't connect to Robb and Cat as much so when they died it wasn't all that crazy to me. But, Jon was so important when they killed him I thought "well what on earth will the show be about now?"
Rob and Catelyn.  After Ned died I assumed Rob Stark was going to be the pivotal protagonist representing the North for the "political" part of the story (war between the Houses) with Jon leading the mystical part of the story (white walkers etc) and then eventually the two story lines would unite for the final showdown against the White Walkers.  Having Rob's entire story arc effectively wiped out in one episode took me totally by surprise.
Roz. I didn't realize that LF had figured out that she was working for Varys until she was already dead.
stannis i'd say. his whole storyline just came to a sudden twisted end. before he lost the battle he lost his family. the look of fatigue in his eyes near the end is what got me. like he was thinking "okay i'll either die or i'll win this battle. either way it will end. praise red rahloo." so yeah the way he just kind of gave up when he told brienne to do her duty. it just seemed so out of character and it made you realize what the war did to him.
Also. The blackfish (show). Wtf was that. 
Has to go to the Stanimal. In the books he will almost certainly win, and he is one of the greatest strategists in the series. I was expecting a surprise victory. Instead we got Brienne doing her duty by forgetting her duty and Kingslaying, while Ramsay is overpowered for about a season after. Not cool Dan. Disappointed David.
Rickon was probably the most shocking for me. I definitely expected him to die at the hands of Ramsay Bolton but when the third arrow missed him, I had a glimmer of hope that Jon would actually reach him in time. Everyone knows it's like TV and movie land 101 - when the first two shots miss, the third always hits. So when the fourth arrow pierced Rickon's heart I was pretty shocked. 

But thankfully we didn't have long to dwell on his death because of the anxiety inducing battle scene that immediately followed.
Doran Martell.  I was extremely surprised, but not in a good way. My response: "how the hell does that make any sense to anyone?"
Ned, then Hodor.
Nothing compares to the Red Wedding, it was one of the most jaw dropping TV moments for me
Margaery for sure. I thought she would make it out in time.
35 replies so far and no one mentioned Barristan.

He deserved to be alive even until the S6 finale
Tommen. After everything that happened in that first 20 minutes I thought they were just holding on that shot for a bit of a breath break. Nope. Sure the fuck werent.
Either the 'Red Wedding' or Jon Snow's death. Completely took me unawares.
Definitely Oberyn. Them feels.
Never read the books, never knew that GoT/GRRM shows no mercy and began shortly S1 after S4 ended. My roommates knew all about it and watched me watch the show. The FIRST EPISODE .. I gasp and freak out as Bran is pushed from the window (I know, not a death) but they loved it and laughed at me.

My first real shocker was when Ned was killed. I thought for sure that a character played by Sean Bean would see more than S1 .. when he was beheaded I lost my shit. And the roommates cried in laughter. 

.... they always asked me "So, how are the Starks doing..?" :(
Cercie blowing up the sept with Kevin and the Queen inside, I knew she would do something. But them two dying took me by suprise
Oberyn because I thought he could win :(
The cockiness was the beginning of the end for him.
Ned Stark Jr. 

Like I knew the show was ruthless, but jesus christ the Red Wedding was something else.
Joffrey
Viserys. Because that was the only one that wasn't spoiled for me :(
It's not about Robb's death, but how the Freys and the Boltons decapitated Grey Wind's head, planted it on Robb's headless body, and mocking, The King of the North. 
Jojen Reed. I really loved him in the books and he is still alive, at least as far as we know #jojenpaste. They had a great actor portrayal, too. I was shocked and sad to see him go.
I'd have to say Ned because none of us really knew that literally any character could die, since it was just the end to the first season/book. Obviously there were other shocking deaths, like the Red Wedding, but we already kinda knew by then that the chance of anyone dying was very possible.
1. Robb Strak
2. Jon Snow
3. Oberyn Martell
4. Tywin Lannister
I would say that even if the series started with Jon Arryn dead, that was a total surprise for me when we found out who did it. 

And when Lysa Arryn was thrown down the moon door, that was pretty funny and sad at the same time bearing in mind what she told Sansa about the fall through the moon door. And the fact that Littlefinger told her that he didn't love her. 

Not being a book reader (just started not long ago) how it happened took me by surprise. 
I honestly thought Ramsay was going to kill Roose. It's a shame he was poisoned by his enemies.
Robb. I was on the king of da norf hype train. I didn't read the books u too much later and thought his story arc and Danerys were the main 2 plots of the show. 

I was so upset I stopped watching for a while. Who was I kidding though, I didn't stay gone for long. 
Red Wedding
Red the books and watch the show.
Top three most shocking in the show....
1)Hodor-Never even expected this to happen in the books
2) Rickon - I Understand why for the show but I really hope they don't in the books
3) Margaery-Never expected the GREEN TRIAL.
Definitely Ned. Up until that point I would not be able to think that a show or a book would kill one of the main and well liked characters and still continue to be good. After that I started to think "if Ned died anyone can". Although that doesn't mean I wasn't shocked but Red Wedding or Oberyn or many other deaths which would too much time to count, but Ned was the most unexpected. 
robb starks 
The Red Wedding. I had no idea it was coming and I was in coming shock afterwards. Nothing else has ever made me feel that way.
Joffrey, especially coming so early in season four.
Pyp and Grenn. 
Jon's took me off guard, because it seemed like it was building up towards one season finale cliffhanger, but instead we got another season finale cliffhanger.
Hodor, Margery, Tommen and Shireen. 
I would have to say all the deaths from Cersei's wildfire massacre. I literally had to rewind the show like 3 times because that's how many times I had to watch it to finally believe that ALL OF THOSE CHARACTERS DIED AT ONCE. I thought I was just misunderstanding something at first but sure enough they all died and it took me a while to realize and accept it. It was surreal
Far and away, I'd have to say the red wedding. The tension and setup was just so palpable, and despite Ned's death, it was still early on enough that we weren't expecting that more of our favorite main characters could die so tragically/easily.

I've never had another moment in cinema make me so distraught, take my breath away, and rock me to the core in the way that scene did.

Robb's, I mean I expected his death but not like that and not so soon. 
Ned. I literally knew nothing of the book when or show when I watched season one. I didn't believe he was really dead it honestly took me a while to process and accept

Time has changed the Stark Children. They did enjoy every moment of it.
if you were tortured and raped and brutalized would you feel any different than sansa? i would have flayed ramsey, he got off easy for all the horrendous things he did throughout the show/book

same goes with Arya I just rewatched and love the way she plays it. I don't  think either is psychotic. payback is a fucking bitch and the north (starks) remember 
Am I the only one who likes those scenes? I actually think Arya could enjoy herself even a bit more. And Sansa was just perfect, I mean I don't like Sansa but after that I started to think maybe she is not all that bad. Is there something wrong with me? I'm worried now :/
I had no issue with either scene and Sansa's reaction to Ramsay's death shows that he did, in fact, affect her just as her not telling Jon about the Knights of the Vale showed how Little Finger has had in impact on her world view. Sansa has gone from a wide eyed girl who wanted nothing more than to live a courtly life to having her life turned upside down and come out of it stronger and colder. 
I think the show's intention is for there to be some cognitive dissonance. We want the Boltons and the Freys to be punished, and we want the Starks to be the ones who do it, but the show delivers the punishment in an extremely dark manner and has Arya and Sansa enjoying it, arguably too much. Compare Sansa's scene to Jon's scene in executing his murderers. Jon follows Ned's teachings about justice and responsibility; whereas Sansa eschews every lesson in favor of vengeance and torture. Her scene was written, performed, and filmed to parallel Cersei's scene with Septa Unella, down to Sansa walking away smirking while the other person screams in agony. I found it disturbing, and although I would have preferred that Sansa used the opportunity to execute Ramsay publicly as a demonstration of the transfer of power back to House Stark and the reinstitution of fairness and justice, I understand that this is part of her character arc. I don't particularly like it, as I interpret the theme of the futility of vengeance to be something that the younger generation is supposed to moving away from, not towards, but perhaps that is Book Sansa's trajectory.

As for focusing on Arya and Sansa during these scenes, that is purposeful. We are supposed to wonder about the characters' psychology and the ramifications of these acts. If the scene focused on Walder and Ramsay instead, then the violence would probably come off as gratuitous.

I did not care for the Arya scene because it had no setup, and the producers prioritized a shocking reveal and fan service (Frey pies) over good, organic writing.
I didn't like the execution of those scenes because the depiction of them goes against everything the book series stood for and how the show started. The books heavily criticize the concept of "Revenge feels Good, Revenge is Right", perhaps most heavily in the Dornish plotline. Doran Martell desires revenge on the Lannisters for the deaths of his sister Elia and her children Rhaenys and Aegon, but by the time he starts to become active in the main series, the three individuals chiefly responsible for these deaths (Tywin Lannister, Gregor Clegane, Amory Lorch) are all killed by others. Instead it seems likely that he, in his desire to see the Lannisters fall, will side with a faction (Griff and Young Griff) that will inevitably end up clashing with Daenerys once she lands - and that clash will likely end in the deaths of several of his relatives (his oldest son has already died as a direct result of these plans) and loyal lords and subjects, all simply because he wished to take revenge on the Lannisters for something that happened 17 years ago and is rather irrelevant to the currently living Lannisters.

So if the books goes a similar route to the show, in having the Starks responsible for the downfall of the Freys and Boltons, I am confident that it will not play out as some kind of revenge fantasy where the audience is meant to feel satisfaction and applaud the protagonists, but as a deeply troubling moment that empathizes how far from Ned Stark these children has come (and not in a good way) - yet that was what I felt happened in the show, which is why it rang hollow to me. 

Just my two cents regarding those two scenes.
No, you see, that's the whole point. Like the rest of GoT it's a deconstruction of traditional fantasy tropes. 

Often, revenge isn't sweet, even if served cold. It's just more killing and suffering except the protagonists aren't on the receiving end. There might be a kind of cursory fist-pump "hell yeah moment" when Walder or Ramsay or Joffrey bite it, but immediately you realise it doesn't bring back the people they killed or undo the pain they inflicted. So a lot of the time, revenge isn't satisfying in GoT, much like in real life, despite how much we build it up to be an ultimate cathartic experience in other media.

That's what's so great about this universe - it really is for grown-ups
Arya and Sansa enjoying their revenge makes it hard for you to enjoy their revenge?

Joffrey's killer wasn't on-screen, and Tywin's was a broken, depressed man.  That's supposed to look different.
I agree with you to a lesser extent on Ramsey, I was sad to see him go as a villain but knew it was necessary for Jon's, Sansa's and Littelfingers story arc. However it was a nice wrap up i think, Ramsey and his half brother both dies and ends House Bolton in the belly of Ramsey's beloved hounds.

On Walder Frey I agree 100%, i did not like that scene at all. Arya coming out of nowhere (and much like the showDany is now immune to fire, showArya seems to have unlimited supply of rubber faces) and kills someone she has never met before and takes *huge* satisfaction from it. I would much prefer someone with a more emotional tie to the Red Wedding do the deed, any banner man of House Stark really would do. And to top it off, she used the Frey-Pie card in a to me quite brushed off manner "you just at your family, have 2 seconds to think about that, now die!". I think Walder Frey could have made a better small villain in S7, perhaps died ~ep2 by this new White Wolf King coalition now that the North is united under Stark again and the Lannister House have bigger worries than helping out old Frey.

Me personally, they both cried about it afterwards. Not necessarily because Arya and Sansa felt sympathetic towards them dying. It's because they were in the heat of the moment. Shit even Jon was beating Ramsays face in brutally until he saw Sansa standing there. It's all about the heat of the moment. 
Does the fact that Walder Frey ate two of his children in a meat pie before his throat was cut make the revenge any sweeter? As a father myself, I can't even imagine how weird a feeling that would conjure up knowing that the last thought before I died was... "holy shit, I just ate my child!!!"

That is pretty satisfying if you ask me.
I would argue that there is a lot to be said for the timing of these instances of revenge that the Stark children get.

I don't know if you have ever read the novel "The Count of Monte Cristo", but I feel like it is by far the greatest revenge story ever written. And the reason I say that is because (and without spoiling anything), the main protagonist is wronged by three people at the exact moment that his life is reaching it's highest point. Due to this wronging, he is jailed for several years and given the chance to plot his revenge, and escapes to exact it. But he doesn't just go and straight up kill the people who did him wrong; no, he waits until they think their lives are perfect and then takes precisely what they value most (money, family, and reputation) away from them.

I would argue this is what the Stark children are now experiencing. They are taking the opportunity to exact their revenge on their tormenters at the exact moment that they reach this highest points. Walder Frey has just become Lord of Riverlands (a title he has had his eye on his entire life) and Arya makes that the exact moment she sweeps in and takes it all away from him. Ramsey Bolton has been a bastard his whole life, was just given the Bolton name, killed his father, and became the Lord of Winterfell when Sansa plots (in secret) his downfall and ends up killing him in a manner that takes away the thing that he values most...control and the ability to manipulate the situation.

So I say, start looking for the Stark children to continue this trend. George RR Martin loves things to come in threes (Cersei's prophecy about her three children, Daenerys' prophesy that her heart will be broken three times, three blood riders for the Khals, etc). So think about who is coming up on their highest point in life. Cersei is Queen now? Jaime is finally alone with only his sister? Perhaps this signals that one or more of the Stark children is going to kill Cersei...thereby destroying her when her life hits it's highest point and taking everything from her when she finally has control.
"Arya" looked sadistic for a reason. It was not Arya. I know those continue to say "oh the tinfoil" but it's not if you let go of precious Arya. In season 6 the episode The Door subtlety (not well enough it seems) how Arya will never become them and they only want her FACE as a GIFT. The viewer should recall Arya being beaten for two seasons now on her own past. Who is this person? What did you do with them? How do you feel about them? Etc etc. Anytime she lied she was smacked. Not for her gain.. because the waif who needed this information needed ALL of the correct information and not lies. 

In the episode we see Arya and the waif battling with sticks and Arya knocked down. The waif then says "you will never be one of us" in to which Jaqen appears and says "a girl has a point". Next scene shows Arya walking with Jaqen and he goes on to tell the history of the faceless men saying none were ever born from Lords or ladies and that they were offered a GIFT..a FACE. He then proceeds to give Arya her task in killing lady Crane and says either way a face will be added to the hall. 

When Arya asks Jaqen why lady Crane and that she seems nice Jaqen responds with "does death only come for the wicked?" Arya says no and the scene ends. 

We then see Arya purposely fail at her target lady Crane. Next scene is the waif and Jaqen (carving a face off just so viewers can connect the waif knows this technical part of how to do so) and he tells her (the waif) she can go through with her target. 

Once the waif stabs Arya and we see her in the home of lady Crane does the waifs true journey begin. We see the waif kill lady Crane, essentially taking out the initial intended target (remember a debt was paid whether it be to someone undeserving or not)as well as chase after Arya in "terminator" mode with the same sadistic stare OP mentions. In Fact we've come quite accustomed to that sadistic smirk and stare that when you see it acted out through another actress most miss it. 

Final scene shows "Arya" giving her famous lines of "a girl is Arya stark" with Jaqen giving his approval that she is now no one and then her walking off not with injury but same stride and upright pose as the waif. 

We then finally get to see "Arya" kill Walder and show the same sadistic smile to imply it's the waif.  Arya on her deathbed of lady Crane never mentioned going home or having unfinished business. In fact it was the opposite. Writers even tried to show the viewer she was more concerned with what was west of westeros. Not revenge.  Walder Frey was killed by the faceless men who have a bigger play in the works. 

Most telling this is most likely correct. Maisie wrote that when she received her scripts for season 7 that she had to go and reread her story in season 6 due to a MAJOR character twist. Hmmm? Its all there. Whether the die hard fans choose to believe it or not


Truth be told, that's the Lady Stoneheart part of both characters (Remember, they give the Freys part to Arya and the Bolton part to Sansa), that's why they go OCC and psycopath enjoying their deaths and in the next scenes with them they're the same girls they usually are.

Sansa character is and was raised as a highborn and proper lady, so regardless of what she has been through, she would never enjoy death, specially when it comes to someone being eating alive by hounds. (Sansa couldn't enjoy Joffrey death as much as she would have wanted). And remember she is not supposed to have relation with the Boltons.

Arya go for similar issue. She's an assassin, assassins are the ones that go for a silent and quick death.
But what does Arya do? She goes for all this problems and take all this time just for take someone out. Stab someone in the face multiple times and left him bleed, kill all the Frey kids and put them into a cake and make Walder eat it. 

D&D only care more about what's more *awesome* and *jaw-dropping* to the audience that caring about the characters and their characterization.
I didn't like the way this event happened DAE actors and showrunners talentless hacks
I thought It was poor having arya kill walder and ramsay kill roose. 
Robb wasn't interested in the seven kingdoms.

Renly had potential.

Balon wasn't interested.

Stannis was going to turn the seven kingdoms into a theocracy because one of his top advisers has a magic vagina.

Joffrey was terrible.

Tommen was weak.

Cersei is irrational.

Jon was put in a hard situation in Castle Black and ended up getting stabbed to death.  He's done well since then, but his political abilities seem to be limited to giving desperate speeches.  Being a part of the Night's Watch insulated him from Westerosi politics for five seasons.  Don't get me wrong Jon's an awesome character to root for, but so was Ned.

Daenerys was put in a hard situation in Meereen, but through a combination of dragons, failing sideways, leaning on good advisers, and plot armor, she put down a powerful insurgency and put together an enormous military.  Without thinking too much about the White Walker factor, she's in a wonderful position to take the throne and hold it.

Both Dany and Jon are more deserving than anyone else in the series. I really like them as heroes because they both have their flwas and blindspots. 
I think she deserves it, but so does Jon. They are the only two characters that do because they don't just want it for power they genuinely want to help the realm. And these threads about Dany going mad are getting so old..
these jealousy thread from Jon Snow fans getting old,
Dany already thought about marrying a westerosi lord.  
Since Jon might be the biggest competitor she could marry him.  
I'd like to see that because I don't want them to die.  
There aren't many other great lords she could marry, tyrion maybe. Not balon, the Dornish are female, Jaime is unlikely and the Tyrells are dead.
TL;DR
Deserve? No. That sounds too much like joffrey saying it's his right to be king. Ruling is a duty. Not a right. This one does not think a ruler deserves it. Mother of Dragons or not.
Surely, no-one deserves to be tyrant over all other people? Whether by birth, conquest, marriage, divine decree, or what-ever.
 
Surely?
No Dany literally has had everything handed to her and earned nothing. If she wasn't so beautiful she would have nothing.
Jon fought hard and earned everything he had.
No. She is just a small girl and she is just a conqueror. And from the example of the Rober Baratheon we know that conquerors make no good Kings or Queens in case of Dany. Moreover she knows really littel about Westeros politics and people. She will come as her ancestor Targaryens and will create chaos with her fire and blood. She is going to take what is hers? What the hell dude? It was never Targaryens. However taking into consideration the fact that the dragons are in high need for coming war against White Walkers we have nothing to do but look how her storyline will finally join the great one. Yet at the end I wish she will never take the throne and rule. She is really bad at it.
Regarding Jon Snow. Yes, Yes, he is Snow. No matter of his possible Targaryen blood he is a Bastard! His claim to the throne is not legitimate yet who cares once you have a power to take it. But he never fits for that role. He is super honourable and etc yet to be a good politician and ruler he has no skills. 
Ironically but I see Sansa sitting on Iron Throne or beside the man who will rule wisely and with fierce when needed. But I dont see Petyr in this role. So maybe her legitimate husband in the eyes of Seven Gods - Tyrion? Yes, he has a good story and he can come as hero with Dany (at least in show) and with the death of Dany and Jon  (you still believe that your favourate character will survive in GoT? Its too naive even fo your dude:) And dont forget about Azor Ahai. In case if one of them should be Azor Ahai and if you wait for love story or at least marriage your bad. One of them will draw a sword across the heart of other to make that sword super powerful.) Tyrion will just take the throne? Or maybe he is a Targaryen too as from the books we know how Aerys felt about Joanna Lannister. So more maths again and A+J=T As dragon has three heads it perfectly makes sense and Targaryen+Lannister+Stark+(not that epic house yet considerable one - Tully) child of Tyrion and Sansa will unite the Seven Kingdoms and rule wisely as would his grandparents. ( at least Aerys was really good before he went crazy and Ned was hounourable man. Tywin is his relative and he is really good at politics)
Yet you never know. Its game of thrones
No because she's a massive Mary Sue

does she deserve it ?

no, she's earned nothing herself. everything she has magically fell in her lap through the strength of other people. astapoor is pretty much typical of the dany storyline. make threats, have no way to back it up, somehow daario naharis shows up while you're taking a bath and hands you the prize
Jaime is the closest male heir to Robert, however the throne will go to whoever can take it (or Cersei, if she can keep it, which is a dubious proposition at best.)

Book wise, the two biggest potential future rulers are Aegon and/or Dany.
Show wise, it's basically just Dany. 
Having a claim is not enough. Lots of people have claims. You need an army, wealth and allies. The Stormlands are done, so the Baratheon line is dead.
If we go by purely legal lineage, the Lannisters are actually the next in line. It's explained [here](http://mashable.com/2016/05/03/game-thrones-heir/#4XnjqZ8w5Zqc) (and [here](http://m.imgur.com/2XbymFm?r) is a link to the Baratheon family tree as the one in the article doesn't work). That being the case, Jaime is the rightful King going by Baratheon lineage. 

However that seems redundant now being that the Cersei has instilled herself as ruler.

Gendry is not a bastard like Jon Snow is a bastard. He was slave that was an apprentice in an armory. Jon was raised high born in a sacred fortress that had much respect of the North.
When Robert was still alive, his family tree consisted of Robert, Renly, and Stannis, all full blooded Baratheons. Neither Joffrey, Tommen, or Myrcella are Baratheon blood whatsoever (Pure-blooded Lannister incesties). Robert and Cersei did have one child together, that would have been a full blooded Baratheon, but died after it's birth. Robert, died, then Renly, and finally, Stannis. The only one left in Westeros with Robert's blood in him is Gendry, a bastard, but still a Baratheon nonetheless.

estermonts are their closest relations.
Edric Storm (only adknowledged bastard of Robert) holds the strongest claim outside of House Lannister.
Claim wise after Stannis and Shireen Edric Storm is in a pretty good position.
Not unless Gendry is still keeping the dream alive in his rowboat. Even then, a bastard's claim to the throne is tenuous at best.
> crossing off any bastard possibilities

Because they are bastards, or because they are dead?

I believe Gendry is still alive, and I think there is a theory that he is actually the child of both Cersei and Robert. In which case, Gendry has a strong claim to the throne.
So Jon would be freed from his vows to the Night's Watch. 
"Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come."
The death/rebirth motif is pretty common in hero stories. George just decided to make it literal in Jon Snow's case. Symbolically it ends his previous life (that of a measly bastard tied by oath to the Night's Watch) and allows him to begin a new one (i.e. The King in the North). Plus I like the religious/mystical element it adds to Jon's growing legend. He's basically Christlike figure now in the world of ASOIAF. It should be interesting to see how it affects the way people act around him.
GRRM: jon is the chosen one... He will bring balance...
Many things I imagine. Breaking the knightswatch vows. Fulfilling prophecy (Azor Ahai is reborn). Jon also may need to be "different" in some way for the ending to work perhaps. Less honorable maybe or just "less" like Beric Dondarrion talks about or maybe even with "wolf's blood" from being warged into Ghost too long.
I know people are saying its so he would be freed of his Nights Watch vow,but in the books he is going to break his vow to marshal the wildlings to take on Ramsey and save Arya who he believes Ramsey is holding.And the brothers of the watch kill him for it.
I personally think Jons true rebirth was during BotB. After Jon is revived he acts very timid a majority of season 6, with the exception of hanging the cunts who betrayed him. After Jon comes back he loathes fighting and war and doesn't want that life anymore because he experienced death and came back which is probably horrifying. During BotB when he's being trampled by men, he thinks I could just lie hear and die and I'm ok with that. Then out of nowhere deep fight comes from Jon and he pulls himself out to take his first full breath of thankful life. The look on his face when he stares down Ramsay is the exact pinnacle of Wolfs Blood. At the point Jon was gonna destroy Ramsay. And Ramsay knew he was fucked

To hammer in the importance of Jon and to free him from the NW. 
'cause he's Jesus.
...
And because of prophetic puns about Dany's fertility:

"When the sun (SON) rises in the west and sets in the east (DIE&REBORN). When the seas go dry (FREEZE) and mountains blow in the wind like leaves (WALL BREAKING). When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before."
GRRM hasent brought him back yet..the show writers have.  
It would bean awesome parallel, I see what you did there
Also in season one when Jaime sees Jon training in the courtyard and totally sons him, and calls him a noob. 

If somehow, he learns to fight as well with his left hand as he has with his right and Jon storms into the throne room and finds a Jaime -- who has killed his lover, broke his honor and dignity again, and has nothing to live for, and then finish what they started in season one with an epic 1v1.
I just don't see Jon going to King's Landing unless the WW have pushed everyone that far South.

Tyrion and Dany might end up finding Jaime over Cersei's body though after he's killed her.
I think this would be PERFECT. I really think it will be Jaimie to kill Cersei, it's the only way, the parallels join up too well. 
It'd be kind of awkward on Danys end considering Tyrion is part of her crew. 
I think it would be much more fun if Jon realises that Danaerys is a nutbag and kills her instead.
I am exceptionally confident that this will happen. I think Jamie is the Valonquar (he was technically born after Cersei) so it's well forshadowed
**Jaime** Lannister

**Daenerys** Targaryen
They do have a number of parallels, but just from a fan standpoint, it would be so insane to see Jon vs Jamie. Like this moment would be hard to watch. Would you lean towards Jon's side? Or Jamie's? A character I've loved throughout the entire show or a character who I know ultimately has good intentions and I've been anticipating every next move because his character arc is so good? 
Also validates the valonqar theory

An even better parallel with that courtyard scene.. when Jaime becomes the 1000th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, after shaking the hand he loses with Jon, congratulating him for going into service.
All (or most of) the wildfire that Aerys had stockpiled was used at the end of season 6. That was a pretty big boom and I doubt there's much left. Cersei could have just used enough to burn the sept down. Instead she completely obliterated it.
Yea i think GRRM like to make his villians relatable so they dont seem that bad. Of course you got Joffrey, Ramsay and the Night king.  But yea in season 2 we got to see the good in those characters
This is one of the main points of Game of Thrones.
I just finished S2 and Cersei comes off as incredibly stupid, smug and arrogant to me. Not likable at all.

But yes in regards to Sandle and Tywin, but I think that's the point.
The show does a great job at showing how human the villains are. The books on the other hand aren't as good. For example, when Robert's dying in the show Joffrey's there crying over his "dad". It kinda gives you hope that if Robert was more involved with Joffrey he could've turned out to be an alright kid. He'd still have that Lannister smugness but I think he wouldn't be such a cunt to everyone. In the books when Robert is dying he's nowhere to be seen. Also Cersei berates Tyrion every chance she gets in front of everyone she can and Catelyn's pretty hateful towards Jon.

Tywin is the first character from anything ever that I genuinely loathe and love at the same time. I never even disliked The Hound. He's a beautifully flawed character..and his wit is some of the best in the series. If you haven't gotten there yet, S4E1 is just...too good.
Season 1 - Dany hatches Drogon, Rhaegal and Viserion. For me this is a defining moment for what the story will have coming. 

Season 2 - Tyrion strategy at Blackwater, The Battle of Blackwater. One of the best episodes and one of the best moments for Tyrion.

Season 3 - Dany frees Yunkai, they empower their new "mother"

Season 4 - Watchers of the Wall, the entire episode was great. Its one of the largest battles to be shown on the wall and the reason is because the wildlings are trying to escape the real monsters. 

Season 5 - Cersei's walk of shame... so raw, so much hatred, vengeance, etc.

Season 6 - Tower of Joy... speaks for itself.
I think

> Season 4: Oberyn visits Tyrion - https://youtu.be/M7n79tN6Fpw

was the absolute highlight of the whole series. Him dying the next episode left a really bitter taste in my mouth.
Jaime's bathtub confession changed everything about his character in a matter of minutes. Every scene with his family, every scene with the Starks, and every mention of just how horrible Aerys and his mania really were.
Season 1 - The dragons hatching. This was an amazing moment that showed some of the spectacles that would come later.
Season 2 - The Battle on the Blackwater. One of the few reasons to rewatch Season 2 is watching Tyrion expertly maneuver Kings Landing politics and prepare for the siege, and Blackwater is the culmination of all of this.
Season 3 - The Red Wedding. This is the defining moment of the show. It shows that Game of Thrones doesn't concern itself with happy endings or typical character arcs by killing off the closest person to a protagonist the show had.
Season 4 - Tyrion's Trial. These scenes had some of the best speeches of the entire show, excluding Chaoss is a Ladder, my personal favourite, and had you holding your breath the entire time.
Season 5 - The Battle at Hardhome. One of the show's better battles (Looking at you, Green Fork) which masterfully captured the hopelessness of the situation that the Night's Watch and the wildlings were placed in.
Season 6 - Jon Being Declared King. While it may not have been a grandiose and bombastic as the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor, Bastardbowl, or Dany's invasion, I personally loved this scene because it was the perfect conclusion to Jon's current story arc. He served in the Watch, fought the White Walkers, literally rose from the dead, and now has taken his rightful position as King in the North.
It's gotta bet the Battle of the Bastards. One of the largest and most detailed fights in the whole show, and the only t have a happy ending.

 Season 5: Lyannas letter.
Season 1: Execution of Ned Stark - The first moment of the show where you realize no one is untouchable, and it sets the rest of the show in motion.  [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PW6wfXPeJTw ]
(Runner-up: KING IN THE NORTH)
Season 2: Tyrion plays the game - Season 2 was Tyrion at his best, and this scene exhibited his brilliant thinking, and finally got rid of that scumbag Pycelle (well for like a few episodes). [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDIMhJQ0nkw&t=301s ]
Season 3: Chaos is a ladder - Varys and Littlefinger, the biggest players of the game. In this scene, it's advantage Littlefinger, as we get a glimpse at Baelish's absolute ruthlessness and brilliant thinking. Not to mention the amazing music and badass delivery of that line. "Chaos isn't a pit... Chaos is a LADDAH." [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxlIraEV8n4 ]
Season 4: Tyrion's trial. No, not the Viper vs. the Mountain, the other one. The second most epic speech in the show (for best, see: Season 3) and especially the one line where he burned Shae, Cersei, AND Joffrey. "Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than a thousand lying whores!" [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4Uq8O5ZhUA ]

Season 6: THE TOWER OF JOY. So many great moments that season (RIP Hodor and House Tyrell), but this, it was just so powerful, a plot seed that had been carefully watered and hidden for 20 FUCKING YEARS, and finally blossomed into one of the most beautiful flowers ever discovered by humankind. [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3IwIB7yfO8 ]
Season 1 - Dany hatching the dragon eggs. Still one of my all time favourite scenes.

Season 2 - Battle of Blackwater Bay. That was the first big battle on the show and it's awesome!

Season 3 - Dany getting the Unsullied army. The moment when she finally got her army and become a force to be reckoned with.

Season 4 - The Watchers on the Wall. My favourite battle of the show! So much happens on the episode and every second is just epic!

Season 5 - Dany riding Drogon for the first time. Ever since the dragons hatched I've been waiting for this moment.

Season 6 - The Tower of Joy. Such a beautiful and emotional scene.

Lannisters have truckloads of cousins, this most likely applies to Tyrells as well

Greyjoys still got Euron
First of all, Sansa is not pregnant. Now lets take another look.
Lannister: they have plenty of lesser branches and cousins that just aren't often mentioned, so no danger there.
Tyrell: show-wise they appear to be doomed.
Martell: technically extinct, but Oberyn's daughters could be legitimized, so that's eight. 
Baratheon: technically also extinct, but Gendry could be legitimized.
Arryn: still has that worthless sweet-Robin, not sure what to think there...
Tully: if Edmure's son lives they may rise once more.
Greyjoy: Theon got no dick. Euron can produce, but lets hope he don't. Yara probably last hope.
Stark: well, lets just see who survives till the end...
Targaryen: Tons of theories here, i don't want to get started. google it.
That's the current situation as i see it
Yes, children can bear the mother's name. The modern Lannisters are descended from a Lannister woman whose husband took her name. The Mormont and Stokeworth names are currently going through women.

There are explicitly other Lannisters besides Tywin's immediate family. There are likely other Tyrells, Margaery mentioned at least one cousin.
Men who cannot use their legs can still father children (I'm not sure about a crippled woman being able to carry a child, as I'm sure it would be more complicated and they don't have modern medicine though I'm sure it's just as possible).  Bran should still be able to father a son.
It's important to remember that marriages can be a matrilineal.  This is where the children take the name and religion of the mother and not the father.  This has happened in game of thrones before, most notably with the Martells because women inherit the same way men do in Dorne. It has also happened with the Starks where the King in the North impregnated a Stark Princess and her child became King in the North as a Stark. 
I suppose much of this depends on whether you're talking books or show. 

In the show, the Martell's and Tyrell's are definitely doomed - the Martell's are completely wiped out with only bastard daughters remaining. The Tyrell's only have Lady Olenna left. 

In the book, however, there are several Tyrell and Martell cousins who could potentially carry on the name. They aren't a huge part of the storyline, but are at least mentioned in passing. 

Honestly, those are the two families I know the most about so I won't take guesses on the rest, but I am fairly certain the surname can be passed on through the women. It's not often, but it isn't unheard of in the book series. 
Martells (unless the Martells are made legitamite), Tyrells (with the exception for Olenna but she will probably not last long), and Boltons are all but pretty much extinct.

But let's see i think Gendry will be Legititmized and marry to keep the stag alive (perhaps with Arya he said she would be his lady after all). The Starks could still live on through Sansa or Bran (and no i don't think she is pregnant with Ramsay's child even the thought of it makes me sick but i will get to how she still could). Arryn still alive unless Robin dies. Greyjoys alive unless Yara, Theon, or Yara die. Lannister bloodline i think will go on through Tyrion or Jaime by the end of the story. and finally the targaryens can be continued through Jon. (which is how Sansa continues the stark bloodline by the way as Jon would have to marry to keep his position in the north. doing this would also start the stark targaryen house hybrid called House Stargaryen.)
Most of this is caused by the Series enormously reducing characters numbers to stay within reasonable limits.
All the big families have some more or less distant relatives around.


Gendry is a Baratheon. If we are counting Jon as  Targaryen then I think we can count Gendry as  Baratheon. 
Loras is dead, so only Olenna still remains in the Tyrell line. As for the Greyjoys, Euron is still alive. The Martells are also already dead because Ellaria and the Sand Snakes are all Sands, not Martell.
You dense motherfucker.

How many times does it have to be said?

#SANSA ISN'T PREGNANT

Season 6 takes place at minimum over the course of at least 4 months for the Northern Storyline. Sansa is of slight build and would definitely be obviously showing by that point.

That being said since the Starks are higher lords than the Boltons then Sansa would name her non-existent child Stark. The same reason that Charles is of the House of Windsor, not the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg.

Strictly for the show only, must have been appeared, or have been mentioned in the show. 

House Lannister: Jaime, Tyrion, and Cersei. Cersei can marry a smaller house, get pregnant, and continues the Lannister name. 

House Tyrell: Olenna Redwyne was married to Luthor Tyrell. Olenna did mention a grandson, Willas to marry Sansa. Otherwise, the Tyrells are finished. 

House Tully: Edmure, and his unknown son. 

House Stark: Sansa, Bran, and Arya. Unless Jon Snow declared himself as a legitimated Stark. 

House Greyjoy: Euron and Yara. Theon cannot reproduce. I'm not sure if Aeron Damphair is celibate due to him being a priest. 

House Arryn: Sweet Robin 

House Martell: Unless someone gets to legitimate the Sand Snakes. The House Martell are finished. 

House Baratheon: Gendry if someone legitimate him  (Possibly in a theory he was Robert's legitimate son, gave away out by Cersei, and lied about his death) 

House Bolton: Finished. The end of the Red Kings. 

House Frey: Walder's elder son, Strevon Frey did make an appearance in the Season 1. Walder still has the buttload of the sons, daughters, grandsons, and granddaughters. Not to mention the bastards to be legitimated. The House Frey is the safest house to continue their name in Westeros. 
Lannister: Tyrion could still father a child (unless you buy the A+J=T theory), and Jaime certainly could as well if he wanted to.

Stark: You can't assume Bran can't have kids just because his legs don't work. Jon half-counts since his mother was a Stark.

Targaryen: If you want to count Jon here too, sure. Dany is still a true blood Targaryen though, and it's not unheard of for a lesser-known lord to carry his lady's name if she comes from a house of greater importance. The Targaryen name could still carry on.

Martell: None

Bolton: None

Baratheon: None

Greyjoy: None

Tyrell: None - Loras is dead. Not that it would have mattered.
If we're going by show. I don't think Loras is able to make babies either.
in the show yes. in the books no.
Isnt Loras dead? 
Houses Tyrell (Olenna married into the family , she isn't actually a Tyrell) Bolton, Baratheon, and Martell (unless Sand Sneks are made legitimate) are all extinct in the show.

House Stark is probably safe. Jon can legitimize himself if he wants, or the line could just go through Sansa or Arya. Lannisters are definitely safe, there are many cousins and other branches.

House Arryn is a bit sketchy. I'm not sure if there are other Arryns besides Robyn, but if he is the last Arryn, then the House is definitely on the verge of extinction. 
Even if their isn't any .... Buy everything because it's game of thrones!
A Black Friday Bunduru...

Can you imagine if Jaime pledged House Lannister to Dany and while Dany and her army are fighting Cersei's army Jaime enters Kings Landing with the Lannister Army? Just like how Tywin did during Robert's Rebellion. Cersei would be dumb enough not to suspect Jaime and Jaime would want his sister to surrender peacefully. Probably not going to happen but that'd be a pretty nice parallel of Jaime and his dad. 
Imagine of Jaime fights Brienne with it. Widow's Wail vs Oathbreaker.

Way too edgy to be true, but it's a thought.
So Jaime with Widow's Wail, Brienne with Oathkeeper and Jon with Longclaw. Who will wield Heartsbane? I can't see it being Sam. I bet Jorah will get his mits on it if everything follows the leaks. 
would be a shame if it was used for a sack ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).
I still think Jaime will become the Azor Ahai when he kills Cersei.
are they making more seasons currently? if so, when do they come out?

I like how the dothraki characters evolve like Pokemon.
This will be epic when complete.  GoT rivals War and Peace for characters.
Keep doing this.

well i don't know who the chap on the bottom rightmost corner is but i like him. probably robert baratheon
Holy balls that is so cool.
Well, there are some theories suggesting that they are the "three heads of the dragon", so I guess it could be a connection.

Also interesting to note that Jon and Tyrion are crying for foreign women. Daenarys is crying for the two dragons named similarly to her brothers. They cry for love but also due to betrayal (Ygritte fighting against Jon, Shae betraying Tyrion, and the dragons no longer listening to Daenerys).

As far as what any of this means, I have no clue. I guess it could be related to Lightbringer in some way if you really want to stretch it out.
All three were also born from difficult childbirths that ended up killing their mothers. Food for thought.

(Granted, that's not that uncommon for characters in a medieval setting, but with two of those three it's explicitly mentioned as part of their backstories and we got to see the third.)

Theory that suggests them all being Targaryen. Why so?

1. All of them were given birth with blood. Their mothers died while giving birth to them, thats how dragons are born.
2. Their mothers were raped (sugessted) Danys mother were all covered with blue spots and was really in bad condition after a night with Aerys as Ser Barristan Selmy noted. Suggested that Tyrions mother Joanna was raped by Aerys (as evryone knew how king felt towards the wife of his Hand Tywin) and possibly Rhaegar raped Lyanna as story suggests yet many seem like hate this idea as Rhaegar was posed as noble character
3. Difficult childhood
4. Family that betrayed them. Dany- Viserys giving her to Drogo, Jon- Ned letting him to join Nights Watch, Tyrion- Jaime (only family member he actually loved) by letting other Lannister soldiers to rape the wife of Tyrion whom he thought as a whore
5. Seeing the death of their loved ones. Dany-Drogo. Jon-Ygritte,Tyrion- Shae
6. Colour of Dragons. The Drogon is Danys. The white one for Jon. and Green for Tryrion as one of his eyes colour is green.
Dany cried for Drogo not Viserion or Viserys if you meant her brother. People do die and lovers too, I wouldn't look too much into it.
Ridiculously well done.

Put this in a portfolio.

Better yet, remove it, watermark it, then re-upload it.

Then put it in your portfolio.
You made this yourself? This is awesome. Love the detail mate. 
I can't believe this doesn't have more upvotes. It's far more impressive than most of the "look what I sketched" posts on this subreddit (no offense to those other folks).
This is incredible work, good luck with your new gig at HBO after this! 

Do you do any other graphical work?
You should try to sell this animation to HBO, could work as a teaser or something.
This is wicked awesome! Well done! 
Planet Earth Season 3 Confirmed 
Phenomenal, I like it better than the real one
Wow. Just wow. 
Some people may not realize how much time it takes to make something like this. Very well done!
This is awesome but I'm also now sad that it'll be so long before we see the actual opening sequence on a new episode again.
Wow that's incredible!
This would work great for a video game, a few tweaks here and there and this is top quality stuff. Far beyond the ability of most people, you should be proud of this kind of work. I imagine it normally takes a team of people for something like this.
Upvoted and saved. As a self learning vfx artist this is a great inspiration. What renderer are you using? I'll be trying out animating something similar soon and I'd like to learn rendering in the process
This is so beautiful
This is impressive! Great job!!
Excellent animation! Definitely professional portfolio material!
Not gonna' lie, this is fucking amazing!

Really cool!
Wow
That was fucking awesome.
Absolutely beautiful. Well done, OP
Holy shit that's cool
Wow this is so impressive! More interesting than the regular GOT intro
This is really awesome! It even uses the same video player I usually watch Game of Thrones on...
I could seriously see this as the intro for the final season or something, awesome job man
Can they replace the original intro with this? That cuts out about 3 minutes of impatience.
That is fucking dope!
This is awesome! If you haven't already, you have to check out Path to Luma. This instantly reminded me of it. 
If this isn't your current line of work, professionally...it should be.
Really good, but I feel it was a missed oppurtunity to pan out on a Blue-Eyd Giant
Really awesome! I loved the sounds you used for it as well. Reminds me of an old ship at sea. Great work!
Awesome! Super professional dang. 
That was fucking awesome!
How in the hell did you do that!!??
this is so dope, except the "win or die" writing
You may want to remove and reupload this with a watermark as people will use this for shitty YouTube video intros by just adding their name at the end or throughout. 
This is really incredible. It seems like it could be a trailer for an orthographic adventure game or something. Love it!
Holy shit. This is incredible. I imagine this is more then just a hobby. Are you drawing/animating similar style stuff in your day to day work? Was this made from scratch or did you start off with a template of sorts?
Wow, this is very impressive. What software did you use?
How did you do that? 
Holy shit, this is awesome, I really want to make 3D motion graphics like this!

If you have some time, can you answer some of my questions about this?

How long did it take to make this?

How did you learn to do this? Can you point out for me some sources to learn?

Thanks, you're awesome and very inspiring!


Did you just make this for fun? Or is it a class/portfolio project or something like that?
that was the coolest shit I have seen in so long. it gave me shivers man
this is awesome, im curious, what kind of a computer you need to make something like this? how powerful does it need to be?  
This is dope. Did you use the typical GOT map, but wrap it around a sphere? Speaking of which, is there more to the GOT world than what is shown on the map?
This is spectacular! Jeez, I love it! 
love it and love the music 
I love this. Amazing detail. I want to learn how please! :D
THIS IS SO GOOD
That's awesome! What's the general workflow for something like this? Where do you start?
@mild_ginervitis dude apparently people are telling you to mark your work with water so people can't steal it, but dont pour water on your pc, it will break. they are trolling you!
"Join, or die."
What's the music? I didn't recognize it from the series, but it really complemented the animation!
Reminds me of the "tiny planet" spherical levels from Ratchet and Clank.

Also it's beautiful and awesome.
When i saw this thread: "Oh great, another fanmade lame video"  
After i watched it: "OMFG, this was absolutelly fantastic".  
  
Forget for a momment the awesome opening GoT has and your video could easily be the official opening for the show. Amazing. Congrats.
Hey I'm a student perusing graphic design right now, and I have also struck up an interest with motion design. I've been making progress using C4D, AE, and Blender and I have to know; where do you do most of your learning on this kind of stuff? Are you following some sort of online class? 
Crazy what just one person can put together.
how do i pay you to make things
WOAH!! I LOVE THIS!
"Coming soon: 'Win or Die', the new mobile strategy game from HBO and Supercell."
This is very well done... BUT you're missing one detail from the GoT opening sequence...

The GoT sequence is shot from WITHIN the globe. 
Do you want a job making Game of Thrones? Because this is how you get a job making Game of Thrones.
I hope you don't have a van in which you carry around children. 
Hodor!!
I guess you are not driving a smart car
Hodor?
Hodor no more hodoring

I will always be able to recognize all the different Alaska license plates
Why would Robb have used it?

He had probably never trained with it, as Northerners don't tend to use plate armour due to the cold weather. Meaning that it would have been even more cumbersome.

Not to mention how we see most Northerners fight. They are small and nimble, whereas Southern Knights hack and slash and need the extra protection. It's part of why Arya takes so well to Water Dancing.

Plus plate armour seems to only be a thing in the true Southern Kingdoms.

We see Jorah with plate armour, but he is also a tourney knight. We see knights of the Vale with breastplates, but then again they are all truly Andal.

The Riverlands use scale armour, and the Northerners use leather and chainmail because those are the most efficient.

They aren't as heavy, they aren't as cumbersome, they are easy to repair, and it allows for easier thematic distinction.
Cold weather has nothing to do with it. You wear a gambeson under the plate to protect the skin from the movement of the plate. The problem with plate or even mail or any metal or horn armor worn over the entire body is that it requires a padded garment underneath. This allows no heat or sweat from the body to escape and a major threat to knights in full plate or mail in a hot summer was heat stroke. In cold weather fur could be added to the gambeson or a surcoat worn over the plate to add warmth.

BTW, many of the Northerners wear pieces of plate, like gorgets and pauldrons and such.

BTW, leather is NOT armor. Unless sewed in levels that are unmanageable, leather cannot protect against any weapons other than those that slice and dice. Leather when boiled in wax to the consistency of rawhide can be used as armor, but was mostly used as a supplement since it was easier to engrave boiled leather. Boiled leather helmets and armor pieces were used throughout history, but never in preference to metal.

The issue is cost. The North resembles in some ways the lowlands of Scotland or the border lands in northern England. The Scots could never produce enough battle cavalry to rival the English knights and men-at-arms, which led to a number of defeats when the English combined mounted charges with arrow storms from longbows. Plate was expensive, though the most expensive part of a knight's equipment was his war horse. Mail wasn't much cheaper, because of the manual labor required to make the rings, link them and butt and rivet the connecting links. Plate pieces, such as pauldrons, beviors, helmets, cuirasses, greaves were worn separately by both mounted and dismounted warriors. Plates could wired or riveted into a jacket, made of heavy cloth or leather, into a brigandine or a "jack of plates", such as Ned and Jon wear in the show. Mail coifs, "bishop's mantles", short shirts, hauberks and chaps could also be worn separately. Scale and lamellar armor was cheaper, as it consisted of small plates of metal or horn attached to a background. The scale was attached with each scale laid over the row below, so that downward blows encounter two levels of scales, but upward stabs could penetrate through the back garment, which was not good for a mounted warrior. Lamellar was small plates laced together with each plate covering the lower part of row above it. Thrusting upward and blows against the armor met resistance from multiple plates but downward stabs could slip between the plates. This is why feudal society developed. Not every military age male could be fully equipped once the administrative resources of the Empire disappeared, so people banded together to arm, equip and mount one amongst them. Since these were the best armed, they soon grabbed power and became a hereditary nobility. 

Even cheaper were aketons or jacks, which were jackets or coats of two layers of heavy cloth sewn together with raw cotton, rags, even straw, between the layers. Such a coat could withstand arrows from long range, blows by maces and clubs, but wasn't really much protection against lances, spears, pole-arms and swords. But it was better than nothing.

No Northerners are not small and nimble, certainly Ned, Jon and Robb were equal in size to most Southerners and no one could call Lord Manderly small and nimble.

As I said the North was much like lowland Scotland and northern England with a proud but poor nobility and gentry, and a large number of common freemen, free peasants and yeomen, who could partly armor themselves and fight in shield walls, or spear hedges and stand off any charge by knights as long as their morale held and they didn't face missile weapons. The Swiss solved that problem with their pike schiltrons by adding crossbowmen and hangunners on the flanks. The North has archers and crossbows are available, so using English dismounted tactics of blocks of longbows or crossbows behind palvaises or field fortifications, like pointed stakes alternating with blocks of infantry armed with pikes, spears, pole arms like bills, halberds, pole axes and shields would be simple. Where the North differs is that it's half the size of South America, so that even with an equivalent population density to lowland Scotland in 1200-1300 CE, there would be almost a million adult males of military age. If the military composition held true in proportion, there would be about 10,000 "knights" of the nobility with war horses and full armor, another 10,000 "squires" as medium cavalry with chargers and 3/4 armor, 10,000 heavy and medium cavalry from the gentry and 20,000 light cavalry like Anglo-Scot "Border Reivers" with border ponies, quarterhorses and lances, javelins, darts, helmets and some additional armor and shields. There would be 100,000 heavy armored foot with 3/4 armor with pikes and such, another 150,000 medium foot 1/4 to half armor with longbows or crossbows, 300,000 light/medium foot with longbows or crossbows and 400,000 light/medium foot with pikes, spears and such. The light foot would have jacks, helmets, shields and not much else. 

While you could mobilize all these men, the logistics aren't there to sustain them. In a feudal society as large as the North, transportation infrastructure would be minimal and primitive, so like Anglo-Saxon England, the King would go to the point of danger with his household troops, like the Huscarls and mobilize the local levy or fyrd. So if the Wall was threatened, Jon could probably raise 1/3 of the forces above within three weeks. The same if he had to defend the Neck or against a major Ironborn incursion. Any expeditionary force outside the North would not be much large than 1/6 to 1/12 of the above forces and then would be available only for 90 days. 

As a comparison, the Lannisters were a rich house, at least through Season 2, as are the Tyrells. They can afford well equipped standing armies of professionals. Their levies, on the other hand, would be only slightly better equipped and armed than the North's. The Freys are as poor as the North, but the Tullys, holding the River Lands, while not rich enough to maintain standing armies, had nobility and freemen rich enough to afford better equipment and arms, like the Knights of the Vale. The Storm Lands were as poor as the North, while Dorn in the hot south would have arms and armor more like that of Iberia, less plate, more mail, less armor, more missile weapons like javelins and darts. As far as the ironborn, they are a small population base, their economics are based on raiding and trading, so they would be equipped based on wealth and with whatever they could buy or pillage.    
I'm sure robb had steel plate on when they captured jamie?
It's not just leather. It's a coat of plates.
The North is not wealthy either. Lannister soldiers can have gold and ornate decoration but that's not something Starks could afford to give all their men.
Because the showrunners and the design team have little background in medieval military history and as a result haven't developed many believable armour designs. People can downvote all they like, but this is the truth. They designed armour that looks good to those without much knowledge on the subject and suits the overall aesthetic that the producers are aiming for.

In this case, I suspect the goal was to show the Northerners as a simple, no nonsense people whose armour was more distinctive than the more common and more authentic mail. The large gaps between the plates and what I suspect is the use of soling leather instead of steel simplifies production, reduces costs and avoids the need for specialised craftsmen to build and maintain the costume.

Robb's use of basic armour only mildly augmented with other pieces of defensive armour emphasizes his closeness to his men and his down to earth nature. It would have been more authentic for Robb to wear full plate - full plate was historically worn in Scandinavia, Scotland and other very cold places even in winter - but that wouldn't necessarily have matched the visual design desired.

The Lannister armour emphasizes the power and doctrine of House Lannister: more than any other House, the Lannister's infantry is dedicated to them, wearing their colours and a uniform style of armour that homogenizes them and distinguishes them from all others.

The remaining armour differs in an attempt to visually distinguish the different factions, leading to a situation where armour is far more radically different from region to region than in real life as a visual short hand for the audience, who can't really be expected to notice the more subtle differences that true authenticity would entail.
Stark armor is a brigandine, not just leather. The pattern of rectangles you see are steel plates in between layers of leather. Many footmen preferred bigandines for their torso protection because of the increased flexibility and comfort. 

My problem with GoT armor is the scarcity of helmets. If you only wear one piece of armor, it should be on your freaking head.
their armour is likely brigandine, with a gambeson underneath, which is nearly as good as plate. 

Its certainly not poor. Its a sight easier to repair though.

I'm sure robb had steel plate on when they captured jamie?
The North is poor.  Can't amass much wealth in a medieval setting when their land isn't suitable for farming, and their climate prevents them from doing much with agricultural surplus other than hording it for Winter.

Most of the southern soldiers you see are Lannister, and they run the most well-equipped army in the Seven Kingdoms.  IDK about the Greyjoys.
Well, boiled leather is all a round. Ore effective. More mobile, siginificantly cheaper, and easier to mass produce. 
Jaime's defining moment up to this point in his life was when he sacrificed his reputation and honor to save the city from wildfire by killing the Mad King.  Now he's returned to King's Landing to find his sister on the throne after blowing up the Sept.
Pretty sure Jaime has to kill her.  Everything points to it.  The witch tells her that she will be killed by her brother and she always assumed it would be tyrion.  But Jaime just saw kings landing blow up which is what he BETRAYED THE MAD KING to stop from happening.  He and Cersei had already been falling out but this will be the final straw.
Part of the witch's prophesy is that someone younger and more beautiful would take everything Cersei holds dear.  Cersei assumed this referred to Margaery but a common theory is that it's really Danerys.  I think there has to be a confrontation between these two at some point to satisfy the prophesy. 
Jamie will brood over Cersei's downfall into madness for a long time. He'll distance himself from her slowly, hesitantly looking for a sign of that delicate smile, the carefree laugh that was only shared with him; that look of love and tender vulnerability that melted his heart and hardened it all the same to the affections of anyone other than Cersei.


Instead, when he looks into those green eyes that once gleamed like an emerald held up the light, he'll see the pale, watery eyes of the Mad King staring back at him. That same wide-eyed stare that Jamie saw every day as Kingsguard to Aerys II, that same look that says that everyone is an enemy and no-one can be trusted. Where there was once love unending, now there's only paranoia and fear, and it will break him.


When King's Landing is sacked, he will be there with her, but silent, and cold. However, it won't be until Tyrion, Daenerys and Grey Worm enter the Throne Room with swords in hand that Cersei will realise that Jamie didn't draw his own sword. Jamie isn't moving to protect her, he isn't moving at all, just standing with his head down. Desperately she'll search his eyes for some sign, but he will not meet her gaze.


That's when Cersei will realise that she has lost everything. That will be the very moment her world crashes around her. Daenerys or Tyrion will speak, but Cersei will not hear them. A black rage will overcome her, and with her last ounce of hatred she will grab Jamie's sword without any resistance from him and motion to plunge his own steel through his heart. But before she can spill his blood, Tyrion's sword will erupt from her chest. Turning with equal parts surprise and pain, a small smile will creep over her face as she whispers "I always knew it would be you." and then she will die, truly alone. 


After the rubble has been cleared and a new dawn breaks over King's Landing, Jamie Lannister will be nowhere to be seen. Indeed, no one will see nor hear from the Last Golden Lion of Lannister ever again.
I believe GRRM lurks in here and the more often he reads Jamie will kill Cersei, the more he will set his mind to write something else, just to fuck with us.
I agree Cersei's end will come at Jaime 's hands, but I don't see Cersei dying "soon"---she's the last major Kings Landing character, the story's strongest villain, and the de facto head of Southern opposition to the return of the Targaryen. 
Killed by smallfolks would be fitting end for Cersei
A co-worker of mine theorized that Jamie is going to strangle Cersei and pin her down with his golden hand
Cersei is actually a pawn of Varys, although she does not know it. She is the most likely Lannister to be defeated by Danaerys because of Cersei's rash and short sided decisions. A couple of examples are making enemies of the Tyrels and her resistance to an alliance with Dorne. The Lannisters would and were much better served with Tywin at the head or even Kevan. Varys has thus far allowed events to unfold and put Cersei in power because with Cersei in power the Lannisters are at their weakest. Varys is involved in the assassination of Kevan and Maester Pycelle. He is clearing a path for Danaerys by making one of her enemies weaker. As for which brother kills her I think it will be Jamie.  
Personally I would love to see the night king at kings landing and her blast him with wildfire and redeem herself. Buuuutttttt we all know that is not going to happen. 

However, I don't think it will be at Jamie's hand that she dies. I believe that she will die at her own hand. Her keep will be besieged and in the final moments she ends herself. She has nothing left but power and when that power comes crumbling down around her she knows she has nothing else to live for and rather die than be a slave to anyone. 
Cersei's redemption arc please, make her our new favorite character. That would be interesting.
 maybe cersei will be the winner in the end. The wars kill the rest and she will fry the whitewalkers. 
Killing her while they're making love. Jaime will stab a dagger from the back and close her eyes.
You think her story is wrapped up, but it may not be so. And she may not be fragile, on the contrary, she can ally with the Night King when she learns, against her rivals and become the ultimate villain together with the Night King. She already has a zombie as her guard, and a zombie maker as her hand, and she loves to burn everything. Why would she be scared of the dead?
Either will be killed by Jaime, or she will destroy the red keep as a scorched earth policy essentially.
Isn't Cersei still on Arya's list?


Maybe Arya will kill Cersei, whilst wearing Jaime's face, thereby fulfilling both the prophecy, and Arya's list as well?
I hope it's brutal violent and unforgiving. I hate that cunt. I literally find myself spitting in her fucking smug cunt face. Fuck her
Cersei will die when Margaery flies in the bell from the Sept of Baelor explosion right into Cersei's face.
The prophecy involves a "younger brother" choking Cersei to death. This could be Jaimie or Tyrion, but the prophecy doesn't say it is Cersei's "younger brother". IIR Sir Gregor is the Hound's "younger brother". Right now, Frankenmountain does what Cersei tells him to, but he's Qyburn's creation. Could Qyburn tell him to kill Cersei?

[It's her mother's ring, nothing to do with Jorah.](https://youtu.be/pSDYLAFwLKI?t=1m41s)
Interesting. I can't say for certain without getting a look at a particularly high-quality image of the ring, but it does look as if the rings have dragon on them. As for why Jorah would be wearing a Targaryen-style ring from the outset, I do not know.
Jorah was supposed to be a Targaryan supporter and work his way into Danerys' confidence to spy on her. Then he turned and became her faithful servant.
Oh man Daario's gonna be jealous.

>It's usually hard to criticize Game of Thrones because of how well every episode is.
Quick fix.... Read the books
Was tempted to stop reading the moment I saw "Sansa" and "pregnancy" together.

Read the rest of it anyway, and now I regret it
This is awful. Take a lap
But.... it's already been months, and there's no sign of a pregnancy 
MOON TEA MOON TEA MOON TEA
Stale
....no...

We all knew gingers were different but this is a strech.
That is so far-fetched it just might happen. GRRM can be a crazy bastard sometimes. he kills off major characters and has a twisted imagination that we all freaking love.
I don't know why, but I read this as Dawn French playing a chav teenager.....
IIRC, In the book, they had already gotten rid of the chains and were working on the thick walls when they were freed. 
i think in the show they are telling us that dany has more control over her dragons that we originally though. In the books as people have said, the dragons are trying to escape, but in the show they ain't.
Whenever it comes to Dragon's and Direwolves, just remember that on the show you're only seeing a quarter of the action in the books because of the enormous costs of animating the damn things. I daresay having the dragons being "obedient" in their cage was a convenient way to get away with not showing them as much, or at the very least so that  when they are shown their movements are very restricted which would speed up the animation process considerably. 
The dragons are still young at this point and their intelligence has not yet peaked. 

Given a bit more time and they would have realized the chains were restraining them and would have escaped about as easily as they do when they melt that wall towards the end of that episode.

Think of a dog and a leash. A dog probably won't try chewing away at the leash a while until it realizes the leash is restraining it.
So you would want the dragons to breath fire on each other's neck to melt the restraints? And Tyrion said dragons were smarter than people? I don't think we can assume dragons are fire-proof just because they breathe fire.

Hotpie will slay the Night King with Dawn. Confirmed.
The only way I can see it being more important that the Valaryn steel swords is if it is actually LightBringer.  I cannot find an example of it ever having magical properties.  Better than V steel? Yes. Magic? Not that we know of. 
I think it's likely it'll still play a role.  GRRM does like to mess with the usual tropes, but he's spent a lot of time on the sword and the Daynes for there to be no future role.  He's built a world, but he's also crafting a story to be told.
Dolorous Edd was born to wield Dawn. He is the Sword of late morning. 
Dawn already played its role in bringing about the prince that was promised: Jon TarStark. I don't think we see it again. It's merely window dressing and colour for the larger GoT world.

Probably next head of house Dayne could wield it 
In the Nissa Nissa legend, the moon cracked open and dragons (meteorites) rained down.  My thought process is that since Dawn was crafted from a meteorite it is a metaphorical dragon.  It therefore makes sense that this "dragon" would have something to do with the Night King's ultimate demise.
Janos Slynt.

I hated that guy. Even Alliser Thorne knew Jon made the right call on that dickhead.
The two slave Masters who Grey Worm Double Killed during the Battle for Slaver's Bay
Ramsay's was everything we ever wanted so I guess I'd say that. Fuckos like Meryn Trant and Polliver were pretty satisfying as well. Tywin, even though I loved his character, was satisfying as well 
Apart from the obvious Joffrey and Ramsay, it was pretty satisfying seeing Jon smash that hammer on Styr's head during the battle of castle black
Olly
Viserys was pretty satisfying for me
My favorite is Polliver's. Arya delivered that line perfectly, and the realization on his face before she pushes the sword through his throat is priceless.
Rast. I fooking hated him for antagonizing Ghost, but that came back to bite him in the ass. Literally.
Joffrey's death was the most drawn out and because of that was the most satisfying. I remember thinking a couple of episodes before the purple wedding 'please someone kill him slowly, I know he's an arch evil guy and they probably won't but please' then weeping with joy when he died. Now I miss him. 

Probably in the minority here but I didn't hate Alliser. Like he said about pretty boy Jon, he was just doing his duty. Janos Slynt's death was better.




That soldier who killed Lommy
Roose Bolton's death was very satisfying. He was part of the reason Robb, Greywind and Catelyn died. To see him poisoned by his enemies was a contender for this. 
Walder's passing seemed too abrupt. 
I loved Ramsays character but I fully understand why he needed to go. I'd say probably Lord Janos. Always ran his fucking mouth and was a pussy bitch. So glad when Jon Snow cleaved his fucking head off. He thought he could back talk the Lord Commander Snow. Dumb fuck. 
Seeing Tormund stab out SmallJon Umber's eyes was pretty satisfying
Janos "Dramatically Stands Up And Pushes Chair Back" "Powerful Friends in the Capital" Slynt
as long as we can all agree the most unsatisfying death was  Stannis 
Smalljon Umber. 

The Magnar of Thenn. 
All of the ones you mentioning then Meryn Trant and Stannis. I did like Stannis even after he killed Renly but when he put Shireen to the stake, I hated him
The High Sparrow. 
Lancel the shithead
Definitely Joffery 
And Olly (fuck him)
By far the best was Joffrey. Fitting that he choked to death as well because he could never speak like a king. He's a perfect example of a little shit of a kid, except also a psychopath.

Next was the Great Rulers of Astapor and Yunkai in the S6E9? (Not sure). Those arrogant fuckers deserved it. I especially liked watching them shit their pants when their soldiers abandoned them and Drogon appeared. 

Ramsay's was great but I wanted to see him in pain more. I wanted to watch the dogs rip him apart. It would have been great to get a shot like Gus in Breaking Bad where the dogs ripped off half his face. Although Sansa's speech was perfect.

Walter Frey was also great. Waited so long for that one and it was awesome to watch him realize that his family name was gonna die off.

Edit: Adding Viserys, arrogant entitled bastard. He had no right to the throne and was like the opposite of Renly. I can understand respecting a line of succession but he would have been a terrible ruler, probably as bad as Aerys and he deserved to die because he had so much focus on becoming a king, but not on being a good one.
I would add The witch who killed khal drogo and Lysa arryn.
Lady Lysa through the moon door,  with that look of shock on her face.  
Merin Fucking Trant
1. Joffrey Baratheon
2. Ramsey Snow/Bolton
3. Walder Frey
4. Viserys Targaryan
5. Olly

Alliser redeemed himself with his last words, although it doesn't justify being a dick, he was a true man of the nights watch.
Only Joffrey, Olly, and Walder Frey's deaths were satisfying. Most deaths of even the "bad" guys on Game of Thrones are purposely unsatisfying due to the implications and overkill often at hand or because they're actually gray. It's actually the greatest thing because they conjure up so many mixed feelings. One of the things that only Game of Thrones can do. Even after Joffrey is dead for a while, you start missing him because he was such a well-acted character and because Tommen is so horribly weak, indecisive, and easily manipulated. 
I really like when Jon killed the wildlings warg. 
Master Kraznys had a very satisfying death.
I am very upset we didn't get to see Ramsay's full death.

What we can see Oberyn's full and graphic death but not Ramsay's?

But for most satisfying. When Arya kills Meryn Trant I was pretty happy especially after revealing what a massive piece of shit he was.

I think Joffrey's death is ironic in a way and almost fitting. He goes through out the show being this loud obnoxious deranged child that became King and his death is so quiet and unmemorable as well as perfectly timed.
Janos Slynt was always super satisfying for me. He was always such a pompous douche who thought he had power and friends and as soon as he realized that he did not, he very quickly devolved into a crying baby. 
It's Viserys! I don't read the books so the first time seeing Viserys getting killed was the most satisfying I saw ever since. I was like devirginized in seeing villains getting killed in GoT world. I was like, no they won't kill him. He's a villain then boom. He dies. Then I was like, Is he really dead? Come on. But then as the show progresses, I understand how things work. But still, this one was the most satisfying for me.

Next one is Olly. I hate Olly but I hate him because we see him third person. If you were in Olly's situation, what he did is far from being illogical. His parents and home basically evaporated because of the wildlings. In our pov, he's awful and that's what really matter on hating him and seeing his death was so good.

3rd is Joffrey. Why not. They made him very awful character before he died. I think it was an oversell (I anticipated there'll be a twist after his treatment to Tyrion) but it's not like Joffrey won't do something like that on any given day
Pycelle and lancel Lannister 

Shae and Olly 
The High Sparrow. 
Lancel the shithead
Definitely Joffery 
And Olly (fuck him)
Call me evil, but Tommen's swan dive felt very satisfying. He was too useless as a King. He didn't necessarily deserve to die but I wanted him to die.
Maryn Trant, the prick likes to beat on little girls. Fuck him.
Reading the books first and knowing only some of the deaths that were going to happen, I'd say...

1) Oberyn-His death in the book is so gruesome and detailed and the show did it TO EVERY DETAIL. I was anticipating so much that is was a relief to finally get through it.
2) Catelyn-similar reasoning.
3)Joffrey-enjoyed every second of him suffocating.
4)Tywin-The mastermind and (granted) war master gets the death he deserves by the person most deserving to kill him.
5)Meryn Fucking Trant
I took no pleasure from Aliser Thorne's death, I think he lived a life of logical consistency, even if he is a character easy to dislike.

Walder Frey is the best. Absolutely loved watching that fucker bleed out while a Stark smiled down on him.
Meryn fucking Trant!!

Hate that cunt
Even though it's the most obvious I still have to go with Joffrey. I'm smiling just thinking about him starting to cough. 
Shae for me, I didn't think I could hate her more after her testimony until she was in Tywin's bed.
The Crown of Gold.
[Ygritte](http://shortyawards.com.s3.amazonaws.com/entries/8th/game-of-thrones-come-at-me-bro.gif)
Viserys. "A Crown for the king."

Ramsay Bolton
Joffrey by a country mile.  Stannis the child burning asshole and his zealot wife.  Visreys looked pretty good in his golden shower.  Those were my best.  Ramsay should have lived IMHO.  It would have been sheer torture for a sadistic control freak like him to be at someone else's whim while locked in a cell.  Worse than death for him and he deserves that. 

Alliser was not satisfying for me really.  He was honestly doing what he thought to be necessary when he killed Jon.  He lived and breathed the code of the nights watch and thought that Jon was bringing ruin to the realm.  He was a total dick but he didn't seem to gloat over killing Jon and he took his punishment like a badass even saying to Jon that he would do the same again.  
I hated Thorne, but I learned to respect him in the end. Even if it sounds silly I kinda want him back.

Olly on the other hand...
I'm just waiting for Sam to die. God I hate this character with a passion.
What if you saw the last thirty of these posts.
Very common, popular theory.
Not this again.
I certainly want Syrio Forel to not be dead. A man of his skill to be killed by "Meryn Fucking Trant" is a real disappointment, especially since he could of just picked up another sword from one of the guards he knocked out.
What if Syrio was a great sword fighter and just died?
I think it's a common theory, there's a line in the books when she meets jakan hagar along the lines of 'the way he talked reminded her of syrio' and we don't see him die, and the hound said the 1 knight left standing when we last see syrio (whatever his name is) was a bit rubbish.

Should we break it to them? 
My biggest problem with this theory is that it would mean Syrio was just another character creation of the Faceless Man. "Syrio" would go from a memorable, well-liked character to what amounts to a disguise. Plus, the idea that every cool Braavosi that we meet is actually the same guy wearing different faces would be kind of disappointing.

I want Syrio to somehow still be alive as much as the next guy, but if he really was a Faceless Man in disguise then there never really was a Syrio to begin with, just a character that was used like a tool for who-knows what ends.

That was really good
How is Jaime Lannister not on this list? 
As much as i like The Hound, no way he beats The Mountain in single combat without shenanigans. So he shouldn't be included in the conversation. I would go with Barristan Selmy if it is single duels, the Mountain if it's a free for all. Kinda like picking Andre the Giant in a battle royal, but Macho Man in a tournament.

For me, it's the sheer scale of the world, horribly human characters, how deeply fleshed out the world is, the combat is also pretty well written. 
I think the two big reasons are that it is very unforgiving in terms of writing (at least for the earlier seasons and books) and the fact there are so many different story-telling elements that are blended pretty well for both the books and the show. 

At least for me, this series satisfies a sort-of blood lust I have. I'm so tired of watching/reading cliche, predictable stories and the way this series is structured provides a true sense of suspense on what is going to happen next. I love how the story truly adheres to the medieval lifestyle and puts the value of a life much lower than today's standards.

In terms of story-telling elements,GoT and ASOIAF just about has them all. This series has story lines that are war-driven (Jon Snow), mythical (Daenerys'), political (King's Landing/Cersei), adventurous (Arya) and even a little bit of sci-fi (Bran). There's a little bit for everyone and you don't have to love it all. That's why I liked reading the books. Each chapter was a refreshing take on the world through each of the POV characters' eyes. 

Overall, this series does a great job of appealing to a broad audience.
One awesome common trait that both show and books share: Clever foreshadowing.

You'd read/watch one paragraph/scene which might seem to not carry any special meaning at all, yet it actually is a disguised hint to a big plot several chapters / episodes later.

And there are PLENTY of them, so many! Which is why re-watch / re-reads becomes even more fun than the first time through
Realism.  Yes I know there are dragons and ice zombies, but what I'm referring to is the fact that every human action has an entire life's story leading up to it.  People react the way they react, not because it's convenient to the plot, but because it's inherent to the character that GRRM developed, and he has rewritten entire chapters to fit the backstories of the characters involved.  There is not just dialogue and action, there are motivations, misunderstandings, internal conflicts, and memories that are all slowly revealed to us through exposition.  Say what you will about his prose and choice of language in some parts of the series, but GRRM can write a damn good story.  And ASoIaF has story built on top of story built on top of story...
It feels a lot more real than any other fantasy I can think of. I love LOTR to death, but that level of connection you feel in GoT just isn't there. The characters in LOTR are all fairly simple one-dimensional (atleast compared to GoT). While in  GoT you get these incredibly deep and fleshed out characters that feel human. Nobody is completely evil, or completely good. Everyone does stuff for an understandable reason. Sauron is evil because he is evil. Tywin is evil, because he puts his family and his legacy above everything else and he doesn't compromise. Joffrey is evil because he is completely insane. 

And when characters come too close to that black and white view of world, they pay for it. Like Ned, he was the closest to a completely good person we had and it cost him his life.

So when you see these multidimensional characters you get immersed much more than in LotR. Westeros is a living breathing world that outside of the fantasy elements is as real as you can get with this sort of show. 

Of course there are other parts that make it so great. The unpredictibility of the story, the fact that there is almost no plot armor etc.
[removed]
I think there are three factors:

1. The characters are very easy to relate to, and had very set motivations and goals.  You become instantly attached and motivated to follow the characters, which draws you into the story.  This is also bolstered by the perspective, which both draws us into characters and ensures that there are always faces to the story that we don't see (this is especially true in the books).

2. The tabloid nature.  It is 1 episode (and about 3 chapters) into the first book that you get the "did they really just do that?" moment when a 10 year old is bodily thrown form a window by a knight because the knight is fucking his sister, who is also the queen!  And can you believe Lord Frey had the audacity to shun all tradition and kill his king...at a wedding...after granting him safe passage?

3. As mentioned by others, the shades of grey.  Each side is given nuance, so "good" and "evil" are considered subjective.  Jamie, initially completely unlikable, grows to be a great character as you learn more about him, where Ned Stark's "Nobility" drives him to his death.  Fantasy is often written black and white, so it was a change.

It's also quite well written.  It's funny, tragic, dramatic, tense, or frustrating as the story needs it to be.

Edit: sorry, just thought of one other thing.

It is a great example of "show, don't tell."  Very seldom is history laid out for you in black and white.  The history is woven in with the story, and time is taken to explicitly lay things out only when both the audience and a character require extra extra information.

Take for example the duel over Cat.  In the show, it's introduced by Peter saying he has a scar from Ned's brother from a duel.  Ned says he picked the wrong man to duel, and Peter says it was the women he chose.  A brief exchange, and you get insight into marriage customs, and the characters/history/motivation of Ned, his brother, Cat and Peter.
Very underrated aspect, its a new take on high fantasy. High fantasy is always about usurping the bad king or some evil force and establishing the peace. That crap already happened in Westeros. Its refreshing and tells the "not so happily ever after" ending that most other fantasy films/books only leave to your imagination.

there is a character for everyone. 
Not necessarily the main strength of the series but the clear USP to me, and I think most, is the death of Ned...the idea that the good dad, the just man, the honourable one, the hero, the one who can do no wrong (at least essentially, and within the scope of the first book), yet he dies at the hands of the evil people with his task unfulfilled. 
To the casual fan/reader/viewer, this is most definitely what draws them in, along with the continued realism, as others have mentioned. However, realism is nothing if you don't care who it happens to. As someone else has said, Martin makes you care about each character, good or bad. They are so fleshed out, so human, you have to care. Combine that with the realism, with the knowledge that 'No, seriously, ANYONE can die', will bring people back every time
Few things stick out to me, the world building is incredible for one.  The rest I'll make a bullet list of 

1.  The opening scene of both the book and show is a magical dead creature killing people, the rest of the book everyone denies that magic and that creature exists.  The way magic, myth, and folklore are laughed at and then slowly introduced is great
2.  Morally grey characters.  Most everyone in the show falls somewhere between good and evil.  No one is truly the good guys, no one is truly the bad guys
3.  I'm in the middle of a re read of the books and on SoS,  the foreshadowing and hidden stories in the povs really stick out.  Makes you understand why these have taken so long to be written, their are many many layers to the series.
4.  The wolf dreams really stick out, but some of the visions and dreams other characters have are pretty unique in the way they disperse either information or puzzle pieces to put together.
5.  The history of the world through song, legend, and ruins is pretty amazing and basically a story within a story.
Its a long dark and dangerous tunnel... But there is a light at the end of it... If you can make it...

I feel thats the draw and the purpose. Obviously there are many great incredible actors. The writing in general is incredible with the foreshadowing. The world is so well put together.
Everything that happens in the story feels natural and in-character, there are never any asspulls that weren't foreshadowed or well-reasoned. Despite what some say, the show still manages to achieve this in the grand scheme. 
For the show I'd say it's the sheer incredible scale of the production and the incredible quality of everything from props to acting. Only black spot is the writing which has jumped down into a hole.

For the books it's the wonderful character portraits, the multi-layered storytelling and the realistic approach to the world, all of which combine to make a beautiful whole.

Only my personal opinion.
Been going through a rewatch with my mother and we just finished Season 2. She's enjoying it despite her disdain for epic fantasy. Her reasons being that the characters *feel* real and fragile, there are no real weak links as far as main characters go, and despite being a fantasy, it feels tangible, almost as if its some history we'd never known before. I agree on all these points but I would like to add that its slow-boil pacing allows for fantastical elements to come into the fray naturally without feeling too essential to the plot, blindsiding viewers whenever moments like Hardhome or the Siege of Meereen come up.
If only I was as interested in my history classes in school as I am with the history of Westeros 
Mornieeeeeeeeeeeeeee Alantieeeeeeeee
I like the fact that no character is safe. I've read and watched a lot of fantasy and most of them I can predict what will happen about midway through. With GoT and ASOIAF there's just so many ways things can play out that you can't predict anything.

Characters are fleshed out and realistic in their flaws. A realistic depiction of human flaw and emotion even if it's based in a fantasy medieval world. 


It shows us the benefits of building a wall.
I love how rich the universe is. With all the lore and back story. Its the same with Star Wars, anyone can get lost in these universes. Good vs evil, Compelling characters, great back stories. But asoiaf has taken it a step further. One could really imagine themselves in this world. 
The fact that all of it, came from one mans head.....
- good source material 

- huge budget

- good writing 

- great actors 
Where's Walder?
Very interesting art style and angle. Is this based on something?
The table Smalljon threw over Robb is missing, if this is indeed based on the books. 
3 years and I'm still not over it. The North Remembers!
I really like this art style. It almost makes it look like a scene in a game.
Is Catelyn supposed to be holding one of Walders sons hostage? I assume it's her because that's the only woman I found in the picture.
Why are there Bolton sigils up alongside Frey and Stark? That wouldn't make any sense in this setting.
I like how Bolton's sigil looks less like a flayed man and more like some red dude going "ehh!!"

But this is really good. Wow.
As if George would have so many salad bowls in his books. 

But seriously it looks really nice. 
I hate the Freys.
Where is Dacey?!
My mom watched the red wedding last night for the first time ever. She said it gave her nightmares and she didn't wanna watch the series anymore because she didn't think there is a point.

We're watching another episode tonight.
great art but would have loved more with some cool detail like the smalljob beheaded throwing the table to protect Robb or dacey mormont fighting near the door the freys  etc
Sorry for the idiotic question, but which one of them is Robb supposed to be? And his wife? (I know tallisa is only on the show, but in the books he had a different wife) 
[What's going on here?](http://i.imgur.com/A4H3KxH.jpg)
This is a playmat that was commissioned for the Swedish tournament varberg morghulis for the game of thrones 2nd edition Card game. 
All I could think about is how impossible those axes would be to swing. Good art though very fun stuff

Neat.
Looks like Baldur's Gate to me.
GoT: The Isometric RPG.
[Source](http://joudrey.deviantart.com/art/Red-Wedding-645981814) and the artist is Lynden Joudrey.
What are the chances, Just today on my morning commute I got to this chapter in the Audiobook. Love the art style. 
This is the exact moment where I finally realized that this series has no rules and George R. R. Martin is a cruel god. 
Heh
This art style reminds me of one of those visual encyclopedias of different topics (castles, pirates, etc) I used to get as a kid. Although, much more violent thanks to the subject matter. I would probably buy a Game of Thrones book like this.
"Ugh, worst wedding ever." -Robb Stark
The North Remembers ;)
Looks like a great isometric game.
"Uhhhhhhh saving throw?" - Catelyn Tully
Doesn't look like anything to me
Where's Lady Mormont?
Good job but where are the turned over tables?
Uh oh, forgot a watermark. The content aggregators on Facebook have already stolen this :(
Bottom left. That's a fucking big loaf of bread.
Shouldn't Roose be in full armor? Love it though, I'd like to see more scenes in this style.
This would make a great SketchyMicro or SketchyPharm video
This looks like a video game I desperately want to play. 
I don't thnk medieval architecture works like that... Wouldn't the platforms be made out of wood? That seems like a terrible waste of perfectly nice stone...
Why is the Bolton sigil on the walls? Should be Frey, Tully, and Stark.
I see Jinglebell, meaning this is an adaptation of the book. But where, then, is the Littlejon and his overturned table he was using to protect Robb before his head was lopped off?

EDIT: Smalljon. Not Littlejohn. My nerd powers are on the wane.
Reminds me a bit of the Banner Saga!
Robb was quite the adventurer until he took that arrow in the knee.
This reminds me of the Acceptance Speech  album cover for some reason
problem with is that the layout of the room is wrong. 
This looks like a "Where's Waldo" illustration. 
GoT really knows how to make you fall in love with a pet dog, only to have your eldest brother serve it to you as dinner one night because your parents were away and nobody went down to the palengke earlier that week to buy meat.
Small John Umber flips a table over, right?
I always felt this is one scene the books did better.

The image of the full plate axemen hacking at everything seemed brutal.
Where is Sandor Clagane... Uh right "Fuck the King"
This is awesome. I always wanted to see more art of the Red Wedding. Now all I want is for someone to portray the events outside the Twins, where Robb's army gets annihilated.
Catelyn's anguished pleas always stuck with me.  Michelle Fairley absolutely crushed that scene. 
Well, that's *one* feast where there was no fighting over who got to take home the leftovers!
I love shit like this, it tells a story from a different perspective almost, in the very least it shows a fuller picture. Is this your own rendering? I like the style as well.
The North Remembers...
That guy at the top left is really disgusted at his crossbow.
/r/isometric would love this
Guys, can you point out Robb and his wife for me.
A GoT isometric RPG would be suuuuuper
Love it
I'd play this RPG.
This is the darkest Where's Waldo ever.
Where is the greatjon?? OT awesome pic.
Too soon...
Where's Lady Mormont? She gets stabbed in the gut :(
Look at all the kneelers, getting what they deserve. Kneelers...
I love this art style. 
Why are there only men in attendance? 
Wheres Rob and his Bride
Best scene in the whole series.

Rob and Catlyn deserved it at this point.
Season 6:

Tower of Joy music

The build up to the Wildfire explosion

Music during the final scene

Music during 'Hold the Door' was actually very fitting and worked incredibly well

The music at Castle Black during episode 1 was perfect for the tone of the situation


Light of the Seven, for me, is far and away the best composition for GoT. I found everything about it to be perfect. Utterly haunting.
The music in the final 2 episodes of Season 6 is absolutely outstanding. 
Season 6. Hold the Door, Bastardbowl, Light of the Seven.
Season 3:

A Lannister Always Pays His Debts

Dracarys

Mhysa


For me its Season 2. What is dead may never die, Winterfell, Warrior of Light, Valar Morghulis. Pretty much all the main most recognizable themes in the show were crafted and perfected in Season 2, only to be recycled in various ways throughout the rest of the show.

So a couple of things about Machiavelli.  (sorry, incoming wall of text)

So the line most quoted from Machiavelli is some version of "fear is better than love", but that's not really an accurate summary of his work.  What he is advocating is far closer to ruthless and unflinching pragmatism than embracing "evil" or "fear" directly.

Jon, I think, is actually a really bad example.  When he comes to power as lord commander, he fails to successfully quell dissent within the night's watch, and it leads to his eventual assassination.  His push for Winterfell was more about his right and virtue than instilling fear.  Despite his title, his ability to hold together the northern alliance is actually far from a sure thing, as he is bolstered only by tradition (which didn't much help Rob).  None of this is to say he's a bad king, just that he's been King for about eight minutes of screen time, and that is not particularly telling.

What will be telling is what happens next.  Specifically, regarding Sansa.  In reality, Sansa is a threat to his authority.  Weather she is currently against him or not she has the potential to be a rallying point for descent should his reign become unpopular.  Likewise, the other northern (and Veil) lords, who really have nothing binding them to his will.

Danny is a great example.  She is revered, loved, and feared in one breath.  Powerful and confident, yet willing to listen to those around her.  What's more, as the man himself said, "The first method for estimating the intelligence of a ruler is to look at the men [s]he has around [her]" and Dany has both assembled and listened to some of the most cunning people in the world, and has taken their own council above herself.

The Night King is...odd.  It's unclear how independent the white walkers are, and weather fear is a tool of his conquest or merely a byproduct.  We don't know enough about his motivations to say.

Dorne is kind of hard to evaluate with what we have seen.  The sand snakes came to power with "the support of the people", but the internal political system has not been shown enough to know what that really means.

King's landing is easier.  To quote a wikipedia article summarizing Machiavelli:

"Conquests by "criminal virtue" are ones in which the new prince secures his power through cruel, immoral deeds, such as the execution of political rivals. Machiavelli advises that a prince should carefully calculate all the wicked deeds he needs to do to secure his power, and then execute them all in one stroke, such that he need not commit any more wickedness for the rest of his reign. In this way, his subjects will slowly forget his cruel deeds and his reputation can recover. Princes who fail to do this, who hesitate in their ruthlessness, find that their problems mushroom over time and they are forced to commit wicked deeds throughout their reign. Thus they continuously mar their reputations and alienate their people."

So there is no doubt that Cersei's rise to power applies.  The question becomes part two: Can she distance herself from that colossal event and win back the support of the people.  Machiavelli is clear on this point: 

"a prince must ensure that he is not feared to the point of hatred, which is very possible."

And this is the key.  Cersei has never been popular with the people, and apparently feels no great need to be so.  Unless she can forge some political allies and keep the people (both Lannister nobles and the small folk) from revolting, this portion of the discussion is likely to be academic.
/u/corran132 Does an excellent job of explaining Machiavelli. It's so weird, I finished The Prince yesterday haha!    

 
At any rate, just to throw my two cents in: I think Dany is in a far better place atm than anyone else in the show. One of the things Machiavelli talks about is how new Princes should assert their rule: They should undermine (deceitfully of course) larger powers and befriend smaller powers. Not only is Dany explicitly doing this by attacking the Lannisters (most powerful) and coming together with the Martels, Greyjoy, and Tyrells (weaker), but she is using their assistance from a position of extreme power, which is crucial. Machiavelli makes great points about how weaker powers should never seek the help (military, economic, etc) of foreign or bigger powers, as this allows for them to control and imprison, sometimes even acquire who they assisted.

Im a fan...
Or they're getting payed a lot now because they're about to be killed off...
The immunity you describe simply does not exist.  Yes, one of them could die after collecting 1 check for 1 episode.  

Noob Question - apologies - but who are the golden five exactly?
Great actor and good character but I can't help feel that no way does the actor who plays Jamie deserve that much money for the last two seasons - he's barely done anything. Arya in scope of work put in and being a major player with her own arc deserves the big bucks more in my opinion

Not really, they just got the highest bumps because they can leverage it, doesn't mean anything in terms of who dies and who lives.
Is this not common practice for a show entering its final story arc?
>That they will not die any time soon in season 7.

That's not a given at all.  It's just a rate.  It doesn't say that they're each getting $7.7 million dollars this year.  It just says $1.1 million per episode. 

If we found out that Jon got 7.7 and Jaime got 5.5 then *that* would really tell us something.
I thought the new negotiations gave them all 500 000 for each episode

Kettleblacks? Ned Dayne? 
Good old Ernest sure took a lot of words to say "Valar Morghulis".
I wish Selmy didn't die, I wanted to see Westerosis' reaction to his choice.
I honestly like the idea, I really do, however I got certain critics for it.

i) I do not understand this line; 

**The World breaks everyone, and after many are strong in the broken places.**

ii) I get the meaning of this, but it doesn't sound grammatically correct:

**"But those that will not break it kills"**

iii) Since the idea is about people breaking / getting killed, their picture should show them being in agony / their deaths. 

After all, the first picture of Ned being beheaded already set the theme. All others should follow suit.


Very well done!

There is only one god and his name is Death.
Hey r/gameofthrones, this is my attempt to recreate a very similar post I saw on here or r/asoiaf a long time ago. i cannot find it for all my searching, so i decided to recreate it as best i can. I hope you like it.

Not Today.
You raise a good point, in that, Dany *isn't* thinking about what happens to the Dothraki after the conquer.


It could be that she's expecting her dragons (and by extension, her), to be enough to keep them in line, although that's very short-sighted of her. 
I don't think a single Dothraki owns so much as a shirt and Dany is brining them to Westerosi winter... There will be no problems from the Dothraki, they will all freeze to death
The Dothraki's Great Grass Sea is drying because "Winter is Here".
This implies the Dothraki would have a big problem in surviving there with their current lifestyle.
Not enough grass to feed their horses and not enough horses to feed them all.
This is probably a reason why all the Khal were reunited at Vaes Dothrak.

So they need to go to war to conquer and take the resources they need to survive.
In many ways, they need a war to thin their own numbers and allow them to survive.

Winter will last 10 or 20 years (summer lasted at least ten years probably 20 years).
This implies a lot of people will starve to death anyway. So let kill the weak earlier so the strong have the resources to survive.

Who said that the Dothraki will stay in Westeros?  
The Dothraki are raiders, they attack a place and take all their valuables, then they go back to their grass plains.  

It seems possible that they will do the same in Westeros, but on a larger scale.  
They will fight for Dany until the war is over, and Dany will allow them to take a bunch of gold and valuables every time that they conquer a city or castle.  
Then after the war is won they sail back to Essos and enjoy their new treasures, just like they would after any other raid.  
I've been scratching my head over this, as well. Does she expect them to do all her fighting and then go back to Essos? Are they to die for nothing more than glory? I've heard some speculate they would be a good fit for Dorne, or even populate the Gift, but the Dothraki don't seem like a people who want to settle down in any one area. The Dothraki see was perfect for them because it was an immense, unpopulated pasture (essentially). There is nothing like it in Westeros. 

But with that said, I don't think her absentmindedness is negligence on the part of GRRM. I think this is more evidence that, ultimately, Dany is not meant to be a ruler. She is a conquerer, as Daario astutely pointed out. She has proven time and again she is unfit to lead. 
Good questions.  
  
Idk Dany's plans, except her ambition for supreme rule of Westeros and freedom for slaves who come to her side, implying an end to all slavery.  
  
Irl, nomadic warriors who moved to wealthier lands got used to a settled life, often to the alarm of leaders who hoped their military skills would bring further conquests.  
  
In Mereen and other conquered cities there is no sign Dothraki really want to return to the grasslands, any rebellions came from  the former slaveholders. Her newest khalasar recruits may see the operation as a supersized raid for loot or far extension of their nomadic routes. Dany may offer them strategically important settlements and expect many of their chiefs will choose a new reality of administering and defending their new lands when they realize the riches and power available to high lords of her empire. Some may migrate back and forth to Essos and like the Vikings or the Mongols of Kubla Khan grow to expand and dominate international trade.  
>...  hypocritical to demand the Ironborn sworn to her to stop their reaving but not the Dothraki?  
  
Ironborn are already familiar with the Westeros economy and, like Vikings did, probably use their ship technology to create long distance market colonies along the coasts. Every treaty with local rulers must have a "don't burn my house" clause, so that's biz as usual to Ironborninga. Dothraki travel within their in their own lands, raids must be near retreats where they dominate and fear no invading force, so have learned less diplomacy. If Dany does win some lands, that will be the time to get out the message "this place and people are under protection of the Supreme Khaleesi".  
  

It's a bout power, Dany is a messiah dragon riding god right now. The dothrakis are likely to die in their 10,000s in the war to come, and potentially nearly everyone will starve to death in winter. So who knows
There is a possibility that Danerys Stormborn is thinking of destroying the "Great" and "Lesser" Houses of Westeros, to "break the wheel", leaving only the Throne and the People. Of course, it won't be just the nobles that suffer through this revolution. The Dothraki will make very little distinction between nobles and commoners and will want to set themselves up as Masters. How she handles that is in the future, however. It looks like she is taking things one problem at a time.
The iron born haven't exactly showcased loyalty towards their leaders i.e. how they treated Theon, but they have shown a pension for rape. I assume conflict will arise when they get to Westoros and are told no raping
I think one of Dany's massive character flaws is the fact that she's a massive visionary, but thus far her goals have been so easy to achieve that she doesn't consider the consequences of her actions. E.g. Abolishing slavery in Astapor and Yunkai without a solid replacement scheme for all the now free people living in the city.
The Dothraki will be the frontline in the fight against the white walkers.
She could always just sail them back to esos
They are both pretty good rulers.  It's just that Jon's "learning curve" mistakes are completely overlooked while Dany's are the subject of intense scrutiny and multiple posts.  
Remember when Jon was guilty of the same thing when he let the wildlings in and expected everything to work out overnight?  He expected two cultures to coexist and forget about their immense differences?   He expected the Wildlings to assimilate easily south of the wall?  Jon and Dany are so similar, yet this is about the 10th thread I've seen talking about what a shitty ruler DANY, and only Dany, must be.

She was very proud when Khal Drogo said that he will conquer Westeros, give the iron chair to his son Rhaego, rape westerosi women and bring their broken gods back to Vaes Dothrak...

I noticed the stag is in the backround and doesn't appear to be active. Might be symbolizing Grendry^ha^ha^ha^ha
I see the Hand pin is in the forefront. Is that indicative of a potential fight for the position of hand of the King/Queen? 
I think the shows explanation was that the Umbers were loyal until Jon Snow let the wildlings past the wall.
I think they were one of the ones pissed about Robb getting everyone killed
Smalljon kind of tells you yourself in the clip.  He calls his father a cunt, and states "I might have killed my father had my father not died first" (paraphrased).  This could very well be inter-generational rivalry playing out.

It could very well also have been a much more straightforward calculation.  He might have wanted to ingratiate himself with the new (and publicly unstable) warden of the north so as not to get flayed, and so he turned over Rikon.  He may have also hoped to earn a spot at Lord Bolton's right hand.  Alternatively, he might not have been wild about the wildlings coming through the wall, or anger at the Starks for losses the Umbers took when they marched south.

Or some combination thereof.
It makes sense when you think about it from a strictly show point of view.

The Umber's keep is literally called "Last Hearth." It's as far north as north gets until you hit the Night's Watch. When Wildlings come over the wall, or come around, to raid and pillage and kill and rape, Last Hearth is the closest holding that isn't owned by the Night's Watch. 

The Umbers have been fighting the Wildlings for centuries. Generation after generation of fending off raiding parties. When the bastard son of a dead lord marches south with a Wildling army, you really think they would side with him over the recognized Lord Paramount of the North? They didn't "betray" the Starks, they thought the Starks had betrayed them. 
It frustrated me as well, but I think it was narrative convenience. Instead of introducing a new house (the Dustins, Ryswells, Tallharts), they chose to stick with the Umbers.

They could accomplish four things by choosing the Umbers - 1) being close to the Wall and therefore hating the Wildlings the most; 2) having Rickon; 3) showcase an awesome sigil; and 4) show how weak and fragile the alliance that Jon and Sansa built to retake Winterfell.
It's quite simple. 

Last Hearth, the seat of House Umber, is the closest settlement to the Wall. They are frequently the targets of raids by the wildlings coming over, and so House Umber has a fierce and not unjusitifed hatred of the wildlings. 

Then they hear that Jon Snow, Ned Stark's bastard has let thousands of wildlings past the Wall. This is an unforgivable betrayal on the part of the Night's Watch. But House Umber - which was famously loyal to the Starks until their destruction - can't fight off so many wildlings alone. 

So they have no choice but to bargain with the Boltons and present Rickon, the last(as far as they know) surviving male Stark heir as a hostage. 

People are crapping themselves about how "bad" this was but if you spent eight thousand years fighting wildlings and only to have the Night's Watch turn around and let thousands of them into the North, you'd feel compelled to find allies any way you could too. 


I think it was established pretty early on that the Umbers aren't necessarily the most loyal bannermen to the Starks. In this scene, Greatjon is pretty quick to abandon Robb before he gets put in his place. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snYE3_GGVcU

The Umbers seem to respect strength more than anything else. Ramsay and Roose may have been underhanded, but they were also strong in their own vicious, sadistic ways. 
We never got a legit one.

The only shitty excuse Smalljon gave was their hatred towards Wildlings.

**Killing Wildlings > Loyalty to House Stark**

They really could have picked a different house
I feel like a lot of these replies are missing the point, The Umbers were famously loyal to House Stark & it was vastly out of character for such a staunch supporter to betray them, offering up what to their knowledge was the last trueborn Stark heir. I don't recall there ever being a very good explanation & honestly I'm under the impression that D&D hadn't introduced enough Northern houses to properly pull a shocking betrayal without using the Umbers. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense, given the way the pushed the Greatjon's loyalty earlier in the series, but it's what they had to work with.

Both GRRM and D&D set us up with Smalljon not bending the knee and the looks he gave Ramsey. Yes, he was playing Ramsey but not for the Starks. 
It may play out differently in the books, like maybe the Umbers were setting up a trap for the Boltons buy they decided to simplify it to amp up the factions in the show.
I was pretty disappointed in this as well. But I think this is one of those instances where we saw D&D struggling to create story without GRRM's source material. I'm assuming the Umber's motivations will be far more fleshed out in the WofW. 
SmallJon stated that he would have killed the GreatJon eventually if The Red Wedding hadn't happened anyway, so he already had a problem with Greatjon's decisions and his loyalty to the Starks. 

He also talks about Wildlings invaders attacking Last Hearth and their small folk. Umbers *hate* wildlings, since Last Hearthh and its people are usually the first target once they get through The Wall. Umbers are involved in multiple wildling invasions. Since Jon let the Wildlings pass, the very people who murder and rape Northern citizens, Smalljon probably isn't very passionate towards forgetting them. Jon kinda seems to forget that Wildlings actually do rape and plunder. 
1 son of Ned Stark left the North open to Ironborn invasions and got most of the Northern power destroyed by his bad decisions

Another let the North's most hated enemies into their lands

Umber's loyalty got their leige lord killed and their lands pillaged. By wouldn't they switch sides?
I think that was a Karstark in the show. At least the guy who beheaded shaggydog and turned over rickon is
Bad writing plain and simple.
You definitely should stay away from this sub. No regard for spoiler rules here. Trust me if you lurk here you will be spoiled. I've stumbled into a couple threads tagged no spoilers and it was literally just spoilers 
Khaleesi is a title (Dothraki for "Queen" or "Chieftess"). Her name is Daenerys or Dany for short.

When they do the magic to try to save Khal Drogo the witch tells her that only death can pay for life.  In the end, the spell took the life Drogo's horse and Dany's unborn baby - and it gave a pretty poor life back to Drogo.  So Dany kills him to end that, and burns him on a pyre with the witch and the dragon eggs.  And then she joins them.

Did Drogo and the witch count as sacrifices to pay for the lives of the dragons? Did Dany think she was sacrificing herself for the same reason? It's not clear whether Dany was planning that or whether she just set it up that way out of grief (and a desire for revenge on the witch).

But also remember that there were moments throughout the season where Dany has appeared resistant to fire - she likes super hot baths and was not burned when she took the dragon eggs out of the brazier that one time.  The slave girl did get burnt went she touched the eggs afterwards so we know they were hot.  And she takes her brother's death by molten gold as proof that he's not a true "dragon" in the family sense as dragons don't fear fire.

Also - why did she put the eggs in the brazier in the first place?  She seemed to occasionally go into a bit of a trance around the eggs and/or fire. Something was going on there. 

So basically the answer is "magic happened" but there was something in Dany leading her on to that moment and driving her actions. Was it innate knowledge? Destiny? Luck? It's not clear.
Its never fully explained *why* the Dragons hatched, but Dany showed signs of heat resistance throughout Season 1. We're not entirely sure why she has this heat resistance and others do not.
Daenerys claims she had a dream "that if [she] carried [the] eggs into a great fire, they would hatch." Going into the fire herself though, that was completely illogical and unnecessary, but it worked out anyway.

They hatched because magic. "Fire and blood" (the words of House Targaryen) is probably the requirements for a ritual to hatch dragon eggs.
you should watch seasons 2-6 then get back to us 
Watching the rest of the series is an obvious answer, but without any spoilers:

1. She walked into the fire because the love of her life just died and her baby was stillborn. She had just been told she will never have children. So, in like a ceremony type thing, she burns Drogo's body while burning the witch who "possibly" caused this whole mess, and walking into the flames as a suicide ending. She wanted to die on her own terms.

2. Thing is...she lived. If you re watch the scene in episode 2 or 3 where Daenerys tries to pick up the dragon egg and the girls stops her and burns her hands, but Daenerys's hands are fine, it hints that she is resistant to fire. "Fire cannot kill the dragon." That, mixed with the evil witch lady burning to death, all kinds of magical stuff went on that night that caused not only for Daenerys to survive, but the eggs believed to have been reduced to stone long ago actually hatched into the first dragons any living man has ever seen. 

So that scene was huge. Dragons are awesome. But just to let you know, they take a while to grow. Can't wait for your reactions to seasons 2-6!
she walked into the fire because she had a dream about them hatching in a big fire. but why she herself walked into it who knows really. that being said several targaryens have contemplated or acted on the idea that if they set themselves on fire they could become dragons. so i think daenerys walked in thinking either she was going to hatch dragons, become a dragon or both. she knows she's not going to burn in that fire. jorah thinks she's committing suicide over drogo's death but i think she thought she wouldnt burn because she herself would emerge as a dragon. instead she just didnt burn so in a way that she didnt expect, she proved herself to be a dragon because fire cannot kill a dragon or whatever.
She knew she wouldn't burn. If you remember in episode 1 she goes into the boiling water, and she also makes a comment that the dragon can't burn when Viserys is killed. 

There are a lot of theories on why the eggs hatched at that moment. The one I am most on board with is that burning Khal Drogo and Mirri Maz Duur was an unintentional blood sacrifice we reinvoked magic in the eggs. Some people believe the red comet all the characters see is what brought magic back as well.

In the books, Dany has many dragon dreams and they seem to give her strength in times when she is feeling alone and afraid. In GoT she has them before her marriage to Khal Drogo,  when she is despairing in the Dothraki Sea and after the birth of Rhaego. In this last dream she sees her brother Rhaegar, armored and on horseback and hears Jorah's voice saying, "The last dragon". She lifts Rhaegar's helm and sees her own face inside. I think knowing that she is the Last Dragon gave her the courage to walk into that pyre. 
Targaryens have god-mode enabled and can't be harmed by fire. Well at least Daenerys can't.
Magic. Thare is as far as I can tell no scientific explanation... There is magic in this world. 
Dont even read the answer to this. Just unsubscribe to the sub and come back when you're caught up, because you will get spoiled and it sucks.
She walks into the fire **knowing** she won't get burned to show power and gain followers.
I think this vision is more 'realistic' (comparatively speaking for a fantasy series), but I've always loved Nasmiths absurd rendition of [Valyria](http://www.amk.to/images/gallery/original/7c815bbdf137c4e4cea8f5473336f3a5dd892495.jpg) that so utterly 80/90's book cover like.
It looks futuristic to me
They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end.

The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies;

The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned;

Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes.

A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned —

The city of a thousand years, and all that men had learned;

The Doom consumed it all alike, and neither of them turned
Looks like Tar Valon :D In a good way
Looks like Asgard from the Marvel Thor movies.

I keep seeing people use the term "concept art" on reddit, and it's getting to the point where I'm pretty sure it's being misused. Unless Tommy Scott drew this up to be used in some other product (like a flashback on the show, a GoT video game, etc etc), it isn't really concept art. 

From dictionary.com -

>an artistic rendering of an element or elements in a film, TV show, or video game, **created as part of the development** and visualisation of characters, costumes, environments, etc.

From Wikipedia -

>Concept art is a form of illustration used to convey an idea for use in films, video games, animation, comic books or other media **before it is put into the final product**.

Concept art is used in the development of a final product - it isn't the final product itself. This is fan art, or some other term, but I don't think it's "concept art".
I'm glad I'm not the only one who doesn't imagine Valyria as some volcanic city of death and destruction. I view it as a lot more roman themed, with pillars and marble, etc.

Looks great! : )
Well, Valyria was built upon the Fourteen Flames. That means that there are volcanoes around. I don't see any here. 

Otherwise, it is a delightful palace in Valyria that I would dearly love to sell you.
I never understood why people were so keen on getting a prequel for Roberts Rebellion. This would blow the Trident out of the water. It'd be so expensive to make, but could you imagine the conquest of the Rhoyne, seeing the Sorrows in their glory, following the intrigue of the families of the freehold? 
Uggghhh

House Frey is considered one of the current Great Houses. They've lost Walder Frey, his wife who was killed by Catelyn Stark, and two of his sons (Lothar Frey and Walder Rivers), putting them at 4.

Until they became extinct, House Bolton was also a great house after their capture of Winterfell. Ramsay Bolton, Roose Bolton, Fat Walda, and her newborn son were all killed, putting them at 4 as well.

Also, I'd put Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen under House Baratheon, since that is their official house, despite their true parentage.
You have a broken bullet after House Targaryen at House Tyrell.

Edit: and a broken bullet after Martell at Tulley
Ellaria Sand: gosh I'm so mad about the death of Elia's children. I get that they killed them so they didn't grow up and seek vengeance, but murdering innocent children is never justified.

The Blackfish may not be dead based on what we know

The only one I don't remember is Alton, could someone refresh my memory there?
Technically, Benjen is dead. Also, Lysa is a Tully, and Talisa is not a Stark (the wife keeps her maiden name, but the husband's name takes precedence for offspring).
Legally speaking according to the people not rebelling against the crown, Joffrey, Tommen, and Myrcella were Baratheons and not Lannisters
What about Benjen, he should definitely count. 
Does this mean House Baratheon is gone forever? I can't think of a living member at this point. 
What about Benjen Stark, considering he's undead
I don't think the Three Eyed Raven is ever identified as a Targ in the show, even though he is a Targ in the books so that is kinda questionable, especially since he isn't dead in the books. Nice tally though!

This is just foreshadowing in the show lol. Not really a theory.
If I had to guess, arya will be walking to winter fell at the start of the next season, and will find the exiled red woman. Who knows if arya will kill her.
Please search before you post. This has been said multiple times
No telling of Mel is one of those eyes.  She has blue in the show but red in the books
I've long held to the idea that Arya will be the one to kill the Red Woman, and whether she knows it or not, it will end up being a mercy killing, in that Melly C. will be ready to die when she meets Arya again. 
I wouldn't be surprised if they met while Arya headed north and Mel south. Wasn't she on Arya's list in previous seasons?
i dont think she was listing three specific victims she was just saying that arya will kill a number of different people who happen to have different eyes. as opposed to say killing a bunch of lannisters who all have green eyes. one of those pairs very well could be melisandres but i dont think thats what she meant. remember at the time she met arya, arya had only killed one person, the stable boy from KL. the second person, a Frey, she kills after the red wedding. she was just letting arya know that she's going to kill a lot of people in the future. 
I don't think Arya will be able to kill her old decrepit arse if she know's she brought Jon Snow back from the dead.  Also, doesn't the red women still have a role to play in the war against the wight walkers? Or was her entire purpose just to resurrect Johnny Snow?  I think she's going to meet up with the brotherhood and fight alongside them in the war for the dizawn.   
The way it's phrased could mean that those are specifically the eyes of the people whose faces she will wear, since they're "inside of her"


Green eyes in particular are associated with Lannisters, so there's that.
I persinally would love a series just about the general histories of Westeros. One episode would focus on The Andals fighting the Children, another would be the Doom of Valeria. What gives the stories in the series such a mythical quality is that we don't ever get to see them and characters speak about them like we would folk tales or legends.
As George R R Martin and the HBO team have been discussing plans for the prequel series, what do you guys think the new series will be based on? Novellas, Aegon the Conquerer, etc? 
I would like to see a prequel of when Bran built. The. Wall. To keep out the hoards of white walkers using up all the resources in westeros.
A dance with dragons. The Targaryen civil war. It has twists turns and lots of dragons fighting dragons.. Brother vs sister vs father.. It's a game of thrones but centered around one family fighting over all of westeros.

For me, it definitely does. Apart from taking inspiration from the War of Roses, GRRM has done extensive research to really replicate his series with the Medieval Ages. Take the example of the Greyjoys. A people who have always lived their lives with a constant goal of raiding a rich, more prosperous land's cities, looting their possessions and kidnapping their people for slaves. Their tiny archipelago doesn't give them the chance to farm or grow their own food and thus, you could also say that circumstances forced them to steal from others. Apart from that, they have also tried to colonise and rule the lands they raided, in order to gain some sort of stability in their bleak and mostly violent lives. However, they were driven out when they tried to rule and couldn't exactly establish a stable kingdom. The sea and ships have always ruled the majority of usefulness in their lives, helping them fish and raid lands and was their primary source of transport and that led them to worshipping the elements as Gods. Heck, they even believe that dead warriors would go and feast in their God's halls. THEY ARE THE VIKINGS. Lived out their lives on ships, raided England and Europe, tried to colonise England, didn't stay for too long and they believed that dead soldiers would go and feast in Valhalla. It is these comparisons that really appealed to me once I got into the show and yes, it has increased my level of interest in Medieval Ages and history in general. 
I feel like Game of Thrones isn't only based on real medieval history, it's also based on "popular knowledge of medieval history." So Westeros is kind of based on England, which gets disproportionate weight in American/English grade school medieval curricula. But Westeros is also sort of based on the entirety of western Europe, because there aren't enough commonly known stereotypes or stories just from England to populate the world with. "The East" is just kind of exoticized and vague, with the Dothraki subbing in for any group of nomadic warriors from Asia. There are three or four commonly-used languages across all the parts of the world that matter, which is very convenient. There's something in the past that's vaguely Roman, but not really, or possibly Greek, who knows. Religions are limited to some kind of druidy thing nobody really knows about, a really scripture-based and centralized Western Europe faith with a sectioned-off god, some kind of Eastern monotheistic thing that's weird and scary, and oh right whatever the Vikingy people believe which is kind of odd but seems to have cool stories. 
I believe GRRM took a lot of inspiration from the War of Roses. And tied in a lot of the major events from other historical accounts. Pretty much everything in the show has similarities to events that happened in history.  

[I found a simple list that was interesting](http://mentalfloss.com/article/56558/7-historical-parallels-game-thrones)
A little bit... Which stereo types are you talking about though?

One of the stereotypes about the middle ages is their myths about magic and other super-natural occurrences.   Yes, GoT adds to the idea someone like Merlin existed.

As far as the brutality and other harsh situations such as rape and plundering...yes I believe that all occurred, GoT may use it a bit more, but these things tend to help tell the story as well.
To me it's like asking about the impact of Star Wars on interest in rocket science. Does anyone think that we're going to rocket into space and engage in lightsaber battles with dark lords? Does anyone truly watch GoT and think that dragons existed and we used black magic to bring people back from the dead? It's a fictional drama with a medieval backdrop. It doesn't make me want to study medieval history--and I took a couple of classes on it in college.
Definitely draws negative stereotypes if you read headlines from the internet and the news, which is not news. 

Definitely don't think it is anything but a story written by a man living in our time period and that the story is based on his own imaginative scope of real world history viewed through the lens of a world he created himself.

God yes, and the show much more so than the books. From the role of women (seriously, women are way worse off in Westeros than in medieval Europe, and that's saying something) to social interactions between the classes, Game of Thrones/ASOIAF either gets a lot of basic stuff wrong or grossly simplifies it, which entrenches already held false beliefs or creates new ones. The Dunk and Egg novellas are particularly bad in this regard.

And don't even get me started on the portrayal of chivalry. William Marshall would hardly recognise Barristan Selmy's chivalry. A lot of GRRM's portrayal of knights is a reaction against modern perceptions of chivalry without understanding the medieval concept.

Edit: also, the goddamn Dothraki, who have only a passing resemblance to the Mongols and whose tactics and armour are at odds with every horse nomad culture I'm aware of and whose martial abilities are way overrated.
Well GRRM did study a lot of history before writing the books. I'd say that GRRM does show the negative stereotypes of the middle ages. He's anti-war, anti-monarchy, pro-women's right, and against the tale of the princess in the tower, as well as against the 'glorious knight' stereotype.
While GRRM may have looked over medieval history for inspiration, his books and the shows are real potpourri of conflicting and contrasting scenes, seemingly taken at random from every period of European history from 600 to 1500 CE. We know that the Lannisters (at least until Season3) and Tyrells are rich families, which explains their well-equipped, probably standing armies. But the military aspects are poorly done and the numbers thrown around are ridiculous given feudal standards of mission command and logistics.
As far as negative stereotypes of the Middle Ages, I can't think of many POSITIVE stereotypes to take out of medieval feudal society. Life was short, brutal, violent, diseased, dirty, ignorant and full of unending toil, even for the nobles and kings. And that was for the adult males. It was worse for women and children.
I like that it finally shows a more realistic idea of what life would have been like. I find that most fantasy/medival themed shows/books/etc seem to make everyday life and people like happy little NPC's that have few worries. At least in GoT you see the "smallfolk" as something more real life.
Does this course happen to be at Wilfrid Laurier?
How do you even go about cutting it?!
It looks absolutely fantastic by the way.
was there anyone playing the Reigns of Castamere?
That is fantastic!  
I would have loved to have seen the look on most of the guests faces when they saw that there was a dragon on the wedding cake
From Dorne?
GOT at your wedding?
I too like to live dangerously.

I'm pretty sure the show is almost done with the Riverlands at this point. We may get a scene or 2 with Edmure, or we may just get an explanation from hearsay via ravens or something. But with 13 episodes left, I don't think they will expand on that story arc any longer. It is very possible though that Edmure could rally behind Jon in the final season, but I wouldn't expect much else from the Freys.
Well the Riverrun set is still up (or was during season 7 filming) so I think we'll get some play there yet
With regards to the Freys, Walder had many bastard children but according to the laws of Westeros (I stand under correction) I believe it would fall to the oldest trueborn Frey male. Unless Edmure somehow manages to escape, rally an army AND manage to take back the riverlands, that is how I see it playing out.
Stevron, Walder's firstborn son, will inherit the Twins. All Arya killed were the Second in Line and a bastard.
We could see some sort of rivalry between the Frey children for who gets the twins but other then a few scenes I doubt we'll see much of the river lands 
I believe eventually there will be a Tully resurgence, but first Edmure needs to get his wife and son back to safety. That's the only reason he agreed to surrender Riverrun to Jaime, because they are under the control of the Lannister-Freys and Jaime threatened to have his son killed.

If they can somehow get Edmures son (priority) and wife (not so much a priority), then I definitely think the Tullys will retake the Riverlands.
1. Jon has got too many problems securing the North and preparing for the NK and WWs and too few resources after the War of the Five Kings and the War of the Houses in the North. He really can't spare troops for a campaign in the south. The most he can do is secure Moat Cailin to block the Neck.
2. We are told Waldar Frey has many sons, though his two most "reliable" were killed with him. Given the situation and the sort of environment these sons grew up in, I would expect House Frey to descend into chaos, and that would give Edmure's wife a chance to free him.
3. Edmure's action got the "Blackfish" killed (supposedly). The Tully troops obeyed him as the Lord of House Tully. Whether they would rally to him to secure Riverrun and the River Lands from the Freys and Lannisters is a question.
4. On the other hand, the Lannisters are going to be too busy with other problems to deal with the River Lands right now.
5. The Brotherhood without Banners is still in the River Lands, though planning to move north to the Wall. They might intervene in the interim before leaving.
6. The River Lands were devastated by the wars and the Tullys have little more than ashes and bodies to secure. They won't be a great help to Jon. Edmure, on the other hand, has probably got a hard on against Jaimie for making him betray his uncle, so the Tullys could at least "threaten" the Lannister lands or the Crown Lands and divert some troops from facing Danerys.
Think we will get some scenes from there. Its going to weaken the Freys and maybe some Riverland houses will take up arms. Dont know about Edmure because he is still in captivity and dont know how he would get out. But yea dont think the show will use a whole lot of time there. 
In the books, at least, I think we'll see a new Great House emerge in the Riverlands. History tends to repeat itself in the series, so odds are when Daenerys starts to conquer Westeros lots of the riverlords will rise up in rebellion and support her. I think the most likely candidate is House Mallister. They're already one of the most powerful houses in the Riverlands, and it was noted that Lord Mallister was preparing for an offensive at Seagard, which means a large portion of his forces likely weren't at the Red Wedding. This means the Mallisters most likely still have an army.
The Frey only own Riverrun (by Royal decree). The rest of the Riverland, IIRC, are under the Lord Paramount of The Trident (Littlefinger) as he is Lord of Harrenhal (by Royal decree).
His control is just nominal, anyway, as the land was torn by war for years. But he probably has some degree of influence there, because he probably lent money to merchants and people there and they are indebted to him.

The Freys are overextended and can hold on their power only thanks to the Lannister support and the hostages they surely have to keep the other houses in line.
No hostages, the Tully's and the houses of the north drop on them like a wall of bricks.



I don't think the King of the North gives a F about the Riverlands. 

It was Robb who was in on Riverland politics while Jon Snow was banging a ginger on the other side of the wall.

"Yet it has a certain appeal."

"The Lysa Arryn of chairs."

Spider burn best burn

(edit: suck at reddit formatting)
Few of my friends thought it was corny, but it has always been one of my favorite scenes in the series.
Chaos is a laddah!
Poor Ros. What a shitty way to go.
If any of you guys would like to see what Peter Baelish would be like in modern times, check out the film *Calvary.*

Great film and aidan gillen plays a character with a similar outlook on life. 
I want to hear Aiden Gillen say that same speech in the Baltimorish lilt from Carcetti on the Wire.
That's a great scene!
Just watched this today. It was really well shot. 
The reality of the speech is the 99.999% of the people is afraid to climb the ladder.
They were born and raised to fear the ladder, to avoid the ladder, to refuse to climb the ladder.
But the ladder is the risk you take to have more, be more, much more.

It is not just how smart, evil, intelligent, beautiful you are. It is about overcoming your fears.
climbing the ladder is the essence of social mobility

no one climbed their way up without taking some serious risks



I always picture Kevin Spacey making this speech as Frank Underwood. "Kay-oss is a LAD-dah..."
Probably one of the best monologue by any character in any form of live adaptation. IMO. George R.R Martin is a freaking genius,
I think the speech itself is good but a little overrated--he doesn't say anything earth-shattering or particularly poetic-- but I think it is one of the only times Littlefinger ever really makes a speech that relates to his personal ambitions and philosophies, and you can see that he is exposing a little bit of his inner self there, so it sticks out in my mind too. 

And he did a GREAT job delivering it, as much as we like to tease about Kayosh being Aladah.

And yes he is scary, and I hope the show sticks with that tone in the next season, where I hope he'll be scrambling and scheming with devious genius.

George R.R. Martin has stated that Westeros is loosely inspired by England during the War of the Roses during the 1400s, and thus possess a Late Medieval technology level - and, in general, only foodstuffs known to medieval Europe before contact was made with the Americas. Martin has not made an official statement on the subject, but New World crops and animals are rarely if ever mentioned. In particular, tobacco apparently does not exist in Westeros, as no one is ever mentioned to be smoking. Moreover, Martin went so far as to develop a fantasy-equivalent of tobacco, known as "sourleaf", which is chewed in similar fashion to chewing tobacco. However, sourleaf is explicitly not the same thing as "tobacco" just using a different name, the way Tolkien called tobacco "pipe-weed" but acknowledged that "pipe-weed" is really tobacco. 

Sourleaf is chewed like chewing tobacco and gives a similar mild narcotic effect, however, sourleaf causes a pink froth to form on the lips from its red juices, which if used habitually will turn teeth blood red (Masha Heddle, the innkeeper at the Crossroads Inn, is a heavy user of sourleaf, though this didn't come up in the TV series).

More here http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Food_and_Drink
I don't think he does. The answer is likely to be historical, as smoking wasn't a thing in Medieval Europe.
Tobacco is native to the Americas.

This means that there would be no cigarettes.

The only widespread material to smoke would be things like opium and marijuana.

While I could envision characters like Tyrion or Oberyn visiting an opium den,  it wasn't until the Victorian Era that opium came to Britain due to a lack of trade with the Far East. The Far East being where opium and cannabis are native.
Well, smoking didn't really come to Europe until the 1600s and 1700s, when the mass cultivation of tobacco in the Americas took off. Since Westeros is based on medieval Europe, it wouldn't really make sense. Before that, smoking was mostly limited to native american tribes, and there isn't really a parallel to those in the ASOIAF world.

[removed]
There's anough death as there is :P
 
Though... I do remember there being a pipe...could be mistaken though.. severely.
Maesters have determined that smoking causes cancer.
While I like this, I feel the need to remind everyone that the story we are reading is coming to a close. To develop a whole new chapter without digging deeper into it would be anti-climactic and rather counter-productive. To set up the White Walkers and the Dragons for so long just for it to be a repeat of the same old story wouldn't make any sense from any logical standpoint. This world has existed for tens of thousands of years and we've heard endless stories of its past, glorious and harrowing tales. We need a reason why this era in history, this few years, is more important to tell about than the tens of thousands before it. 
Do you think 13 episodes is enough to completely do a 180 on Danys character? I don't think so as cool as it sounds, I'd rather it end with her sacrificing herself even if id be sad forever lol
As long as Cleganebowl is 100% confirmed I'm good with anything 
While I agree that Dragons vs WWs would be way too predictable and I hope we'll see something slightly different and more interesting, I don't think this will be the end. If anything she'll probably have to sacriface her or something. Or Jon will have to kill her to create the Lightbringer sword to defeat them or something.

> why was Brienne and the Hound's fight so brutal watch

I needed a cigarette after!

This prediction has been around for a very long time... I remember reading a version a while ago the first time.

AS fitting as it would be... and as much sense as it would make... I feel it would just be too anti-climatic in a way.

The way the story has been building... Dany might be impulsive with her decisions with war but thats why she has Tyrion. To remind her of her gentle heart and keep the thoughts of peaceful alternatives in her head.

And thats the main difference between Dany and Aerys. Dany was acting impulsive and sometimes against her own wishes FOR the people of Mereen. Aerys simply went mad.

I don't think Tyrion needs to be a Targaryen in order to be a dragon rider. He was born of blood just as Jon and Dany were as well as satisfying some other requirements. If anything it would be more satisfying if Jaime and Cersei were Aery's kids making Tyrion the true son of Tywin.

Now that doesn't mean that the main characters won't die... just not until their time comes in the final hours.
While this is a pretty decent theory, I don't think Martin or the writers would "reveal" Tyrion to be a Targaryen. Firstly, it would be a whole new story they'd have to add and with only 13 episodes there are just too many loose strings to tie up as is. Secondly, Martin is a bit too unpredictable for that. Tyrion will end up being a dragonrider, simple as that. I don't really see him having such a huge impact on the coming war against the WW, other than his expansive knowledge.
I see Bran playing a major role in the war against the WW as he knows more about the past and the WW, etc than any of the other characters. Though, I doubt he will survive since he has never fought in any battle of any kind and the only protection he has would be Jon's army.
I really enjoyed your theory, thank you for sharing it! I love that you thought a little deeper, and that you tried to consider what the author is trying to do. 

I disagree about your ending but now you did get me thinking about the possibility that Jon is going to have to kill Dany because she's burning people. He doesn't like that. And he doesn't like it when people act without mercy, which she has been known to do as well, despite her reputation. 
I like it!
Tyrion better fuck shit up when he returns with Deanerys! He deserves the best! IMO
As two of my favorite characters. This was beautiful. Also, the song was great, even better in the Westworld scene ;)
Tyrion and Tywin have such similar personalities. It's so sad, because had Tyrion not been a dwarf, I feel like Tywin would have forgiven Tyrion for his wife's death, and Tyrion would be his pride and joy.
What was the musical piece used in that video? That shit was fire

I love Tyrion and Tywin :) they have very complicated relationship. They hated each other despite being very similiar in some ways. Even Jaime-Tywin bond can't be compared to it :D
  Tyrion loved his father.. he gave him an Arrow Shirt.
It's not that bad, but your timing is way off.

Jorah's words about everyone wanting to kill her and simply take the dragons were probably echoing in her head. They agreed to greet her, but only so far as to see the dragons, which is very suspicious.
What's the best that could come from showing the dragons, entry? The worst, "oh the dragons ARE real, cool, kill her and chain them up." 
They are the most valuable things in the world. I think she was trying to protect them. Also her and her people were really weak so if they did try to take the dragons they might not have been able to fight them off as well as they could after they had ate and rested 
  They were puppies and vulnerable.
because you dont make demands to the mother of dragons
She may have also been playing on the "guest" rule.  If she could get someone to allow her entry as their official guest it may have afforded her more protection.
CGI budget
I'm guessing she didn't want to wake the dragons.
CGI dragons cost a lot of money, that's the real reason for the show. But in the story, I think she said some shitty reason like "They're really tired" or someting.
Probably because they were still 'new' and she was afraid of putting them in harms way.
Deadass it was because of budget. In the books she shows them off all the Damn time 
Because CGI is [expensive](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZAMFXpsDweE/UzwO66dMbJI/AAAAAAABS2s/lBLoQnpGpCI/s1600/We+were+way+over+budget+for+our+CGI+ok.jpg)

great job! i really enjoyed that! :)
So basically, Jon Snow has officially activated plot armour.
I think it has some truth to it. With Jon being proclaimed Azor Ahai by Melisandre after he is resurrected his 'destiny' and the prophecy surrounding him sort of means he can't die until the end of the second war for the dawn comes about. So you could see that as him being literally invincible until then.
Leeeeerooooyyyyy Jjjjenkins!!!!
Its not quite that. Melisandre (or Thoros, or anyone else whos in tune with the Lord of Light) can likely continue to resurrect Jon without repercussion until the prophecy is fulfilled 
I don't think they will be so forward with it - like yes he probably is Azor Ahai reborn but even if he fully realizes it, he will likely act the same in battle.  Remember, he doesn't want to die again - the first time kinda spooked him

Didn't D&D say that battle was mainly to show how important luck was during a battle and how chaotic battles are? Plus the director had to change some stuff because of timing 
Someone calculated a while ago that in the BoB he kills like 18 people. 
I just finished the whole game of thrones tv show at once, it seems from the last episode that Jon is the son of Rhaegar targaryen, in which case even fire can’t kill him.

Daenerys has something very big coming her way, as being son of Rhaegar makes Jon the rightful heir to the iron throne. this is going to be very interesting
I waited for season 6 to finish, without watching a single episode.

Avoided all subreddits, all kinds of entertainment sites, anything which might give out spoilers.

Then there came a day when my wife returned to her hometown to visit her parents......and I sat down and watched the entire season in one shot.

Best day of the year so far
Watched 4 seasons in 3 days when S5 came out. It was amazing.
Me and my friend watched Season 5 in its entirety in one day. The only thing we got up for was to piss and get the pizza.
Me and my dad watched all of season 2 in 1 day. All the episodes in all the 1 hour glory.
I started watching before season 5 and did season 1-4 in a week because stupid work had to get in the way. I have a friend who did 1-4 in four days though haha. Her sleeping schedule was a little wonky after that. 
6 or 7 episodes in one day. That's my Game of Thrones record. I won't even go into talking about some other series.

My dad and I watched seasons 1-6 in 5 days.
My record is watching season 1-5 in roughly 2-3 days. It was a dark time full of coffee and lack of sleep.
Finished the 6 seasons in 5 days 
My brothers watched all 5 seasons in 5 straight days before season 6 came out. I was pretty impressed.
At the time there was only 5 seasons, is did it in 5 days though. 
It took my wife and me a month or so.
I'm about to finish the last of the books in less than a month. Looking like it will have taken me 25 days if I can finish up before leaving for my Thanksgiving travels.
Yeah roughy 2 weeks it took me to watch season 1-5.
I watched it over reading week for the first time 5 or 6 days. 
I only started watching this summer. I watched the entire thing in about 2 weeks, probably less. Started with the goal of 2 episodes a day. After the first day that turned into 3 episodes a day. Then it increased and increased and I watched season 5 and season 6 in about 4 days or so. 
5 seasons in 3 days.
I managed 1-5 in three days before the season 6 premiere, I also plan on trying to watch 1-6 shortly before 7 comes out. 
in the last summer , i watched the 6 seasons in 6days, actually in the 1st day i watched 14 episodes from s1 if i didnt feel tired i wouldnt stop rofl , was so excited , that week was like breakfast - GoT - Dinner - GoT - Sleep. didnt do anything else besides watching GoT 
I watched S01 - S03 in a weekend. My friends always said that S03E09 was pretty "intense"... and it was.
It would be a bit repetitive if it Tyrion were to be a Targaryen what with Jon "secretly" being one and all. 
I'd hate it if he was. I always loved the relationship between Tyrion and Tywin. Tywin never really cared if his children had personal martial prowess like Jaime. He cared about having an heir who was a strong ruler who could carry on the Lannister name. 

He got exactly what he wanted in Tyrion. I believe that had Joanna survive his birth Tywin would have been over the moon with Tyrion as his heir, as he is a better ruler than Jaime ever was (or even wanted to be for that matter). To me, I'd say the only reason he doesn't like Tyrion is the fact that Joanna dies giving birth to him and Tywin genuinely loved her, and all their issues stemmed from that.

That's why I'd hate Tyrion to be a Targ, it would completely ruin this.

I actually worked with people for about a year rebuilding Westeros in the Skyrim engine.  We had the entire map working and you could ride from Dorne to the wall, but it was just plain dirt.  Also had the Godswood modeled entirely, I think I still have some pics.  Unfortunately we bit off more than we could chew and the team fell apart.  I really wish it would've kept on.

Fitting to have Baelish in Riften, home of the Thieves Guild of Skyrim.
You know, Petyr would fit so damn well in the Thieves Guild. Or Thalmor.
Why does it look like shit lol
Jon wearing Longclaw long before he even got it. Literally unwatchable!

I made this. It was first posted in the channel 'UpIsNotJump' this links to a pirated vesion of my video. Here is the original:

 I'll go cry at how easily my work was stolen.

Could you provide all the info to create the mother of dragons as a character. 
I think we must help raise money for this guy, so that he can buy a graphic card.
I role played my last playthrough as Jon Snow but ended up screwing up and turning into a sneak archer vampire about mid way through. 
Great. Now I want to make westeros in skyrim :/  
Ambitious projects fail tho, so maybe I shouldn't.
Brilliant! This makes me almost wish I wasn't a cord cutter. How do I watch GoTs now?!
Hearing Ned's voice again made me really sad.
wow
What do you need for a team? 
That sneaky witcher medalion...
Bethesda should have made an entire GOT game!
An open world GoT RPG game needs to fucking happen. How it's not already in the works is completely beyond me. 
Omg, I started laughing as soon as it started... haven't stopped.


This is waaaay more hilarious to me than it should be.

1. There are a few different people who have the power to warg, a lot of the Stark children have dreams of seeing through the eyes of their wolves for example.  Of course there are other wargs who can control animals, but Bran so far has been the only one to warg into a human.  There was only one other attempt to do so by a warg in the books and the person being warged into went crazy and clawed their own eyes out.

2.  The Faceless Men worship the Many-Faced God, some of these Faceless Men have the ability to wear another person's face.  They are a society of assassins, people hire them to kill, but the price is usually very very high.  These assassins have their own interests they are working towards, but they are a religious group who sees death as a merciful end to suffering.

Bran is not only a Warg, but also a Green Seer, they combine together to make him extra powerful.

The many faced God is the God of death and his followers give his gift to those who have been selected(by asking for it for yourself, or by purchasing it for someone else with whatever is most valuable to you) they're a religion, that's why they do it, not for money. The faces they get come from those who enter the order and those who willingly accept the gift of the many faced God(though Arya knows how to take faces now, so we could potentially see her steal someone's face)

The many faced god is death - it has many faces because the Faceless Men point out that every religion has a god of death of some sort and all those manifestations are the same god of death. The faceless men have sacrificed their own faces/identities in order to serve the god of death.  

There's a short about it in the season six DVD extras.  
The direwolf was back in winterfell for last season's finale. There will probably be a lion in Kings Landing for the opening as well.
I was wondering if the explosion of Kings Landing is reflected in the map too.
I sure hope we shall never again see Meereen in the opening
Yes I'm 100% sure of it. The direwolf was already back in S6E10 
It'll be interesting. Will the Sept of Baelor be a pile of rubble in the intro? Will the Lannister sigil appear there? What place will they show as "wherever Dany is"? A middle of the sea?
I assume the following locations will appear in the opening next season:

King's Landing

Winterfell

The Wall

Dragonstone

Oldtown

The Twins/Dorne/Highgarden/Casterly Rock depending on the episode

Or maybe they will go back to less than six locations like in Season 1

Seems to be a lot of confusion here. The TV show has 6 years passing, 298 AL to 304 AL. See here: http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline
The books have 3 years passing late 297 AC to 300 AC, see here: http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Timeline_of_major_events
I think anywhere from 4-5 years is likely.  I think 6 might be too much, but I'm not 100% sure
Series starts in around 297 AC and is currently in 303 AC according to the wiki, so about 5-6 years
They seem to be following the TV trope of a year to a season. 

In S3 they refer to it being a couple of years since Ned etc. 
It took six full seasons just for winter to come. It clearly hasnt even been a year

2-3 years (two is more likely)
The TV show just nerfed Gerold hard for Arthur to be more intimidating and dominant
He was the better fighter by far. So perhaps Gerold just followed him in situations like these. I think Arthur Dayne commanded huge respect among the kingsguard.

On another note. Am I the only one noticing Arthur Dayne first sticks his sword in the sand and a second later draws his swords from his swordsbelt?
I predict the most popular title in Westeros will be: Deceased
Tyrion: Hand of the King/Queen and God of Tits and Wine
Sandor Clegane: Kinslayer, crumbler of mountains, eater of chickens, Azor Ahype!!
I think Littlefinger ends up on the Iron Throne
King of the Andals and the First Men: Eddison Tollett
There probably won't be people with those titles.
King- Ser Pounce 
king jon snow 
I don't think there will be titles to hold by the end of the show. I predict either a revolution or a necessary reconstruction of the social system following the great war to come.

You mention the horrible thing she did, which she would have been executed for had she not been banished.  I think banishment over execution was at least partly due to her bringing him back from the dead.  
Jon is an honorable man just like Ned. If anything, letting her leave Winterfell was a sign of mercy on his part, as what she did is certainly punishable by death. Sparing her life repays the debt Jon owes her. On the other hand, Jon didn't want to be brought back and went through PTSD for the majority of S6. So I don't even thinks he looks at it that way. Plus, Mellisandre herself would deny that she had anything to do with the resurrection, as she credits all of the miracles and stuff to R'hllor.
Jon said to showMelisandre that he did *not* want to be brought back to life again so he wont miss that ability, Jon would likely lose the support of Davos (perhaps not a huge loss), she did something horrible and Melisandre does not have the same pull/weight in the North  that she had with Stannis, they don't follow her red god so she has little political significance. I'd say Jon made the right call. 

We still have the Arya-Melisandre meeting to look forward to tough!
Honestly I think Melisandre will rally the Brotherhood Without Banners and lead them North to come to the aid of the Wall.  
Melisandre needed to go south to cross paths with Arya. Remember, Mel: "We will meet again" 
I agree that Jon supposedly should keep melissandre. However, since Bran is on journey back to Winterfell, I think he can be the substitute for Melissandre. So, IMHO, Jon being King Solomon to Melissandre's death sentence (as suggested by Davos), is a win-win agreement for everybody. 
It was a stupid move on Jon's part to say the least. Total Ned move. Winter is coming - he knows that. There's not a lot Davos can do about that, but Melissandre seem to be able to help quite a bit.

its going to be Dragonstone


Visited today the amazing Gatzelugatxe where game of thrones season 7 took place recently. Locals speculate that with some CGI they'll remove the small church and put casterly rock on top.

Media however spotted Jon Snow, Davos, Danny T and Tyrion.. which makes me think this is where she lands and meets Jon and Co..

Why is it timestamped at 0:30?

edit: also, have you perchance seen [this one?](https://youtu.be/11TZzy-T_GY)
Needed to end with the 1v1 vs Ramsey
It's pretty epic, some parts could have used louder audio of the speech. 
We're still so far away from next season. Doesn't Vikings start back up soon? Need something to hold me over.
I legitimately cried while watching, this is beautifully well done. Jon's story is filled with so much tragedy, anger, pain, and betrayal. He's been through so much in such a short time, and the sad part is the worst battles are the ones that lie ahead.
KING A DA NORF
Good but doesnt beat : The white wolf from zurik 23M

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0jSP1Pwrtc

Now THATS the Jon snow vid
Music is too loud/annoying
Long live the king!
This was good.  Could've used more voice over and sometimes the lyrics got in the way of what people were saying.

Edit:  The top comment's video has the kind of voice over's I was talking about.  It's very effective with these kinds of things.    

Edit 2:  And that video's music doesn't get in the way of the dialogue.
I like the selection of clips and the song is alright, but the sound mixing in this is pretty bad, and the unnecessary jump cuts really bothered me. The editing also felt pretty uninspired. If the creator is reading -- sorry for being a shit.

Edit to make this criticism more constructive:

* Watch out for audio balance issues. Try listening on headphones & speakers at multiple volumes
* The jump cuts don't work in this -- the quotes pulled out were good, but cover cuts by switching to a voiceover
* The pacing of cuts and on-screen action feel off. Hard to prescribe a specific remedy for this, it's just something you get better at over time. Walter Murch's book *In the Blink of an Eye* helped me with this. (And frankly, you probably don't need to buy and read the book, just read a summary somewhere because Murch's main point is very straightforward.)
Nice , editing's good for once .
Editing and audio is crap. I couldn't even get through it. 
Anyone else get the BD? There's a special feature for the battle of the bastards and one of the commentaries for that episode includes, I think, the fight coordinator. I haven't had a chance to watch it yet. 
Nice job
Fuck yeah John-O fuck yeeeeeeaaaaahhh
Too heavy-handed with the almost jump cut style editing, the music was too loud over some of the clips of dialogue, and while I'm not necessarily opposed to using some clips out of sequence for dramatic enhancement, so much of this was chronologically all over the place that it just didn't make for good storytelling.
This is shit.

A relatively realistic depiction of a medieval society.
Just starting the show im assuming?
To be honest this happens more often than you think, even in our current society (although deaths in labor nowadays are pretty rare in medically advanced countries).

If your mother died during childbirth giving birth to one of your siblings, you don't think you would despise that sibling just a little bit? Sure, you know it wasn't his/her *fault*, technically speaking, but if that sibling had never been born, your mother would still be alive. Now add to it that the sibling that was born had some kind of noticeable birth defect.

Isn't it kind of easy to weigh it and say that you'd rather keep your mother and lose the sibling? It's terrible to think about, but that's the cold hard reality the show is describing.
Saudi Arabia?
...I think you are referring to somewhere horrible, like Earth, where humans have lived and have done these things to each other since the beginning of our history. 

Edit: Wait. Are you trolling? You got me if you did.
It depends on how you define maturity. Even in ancient societies, the first menstrual period of a female represented maturity, the arrival at the primary function of a mature female, the bearing of children. At this point, in ancient and medieval and even in some pre-Modern societies (like Kentucky today), girls became women. Thus marriage at 13 and 14 years of age. Given the average life expectancy in such societies, which ran from between 35-45 years of age and the need to produce children to provide labor for farming and other work and to reach maturity and care for the parents in their "old" age, women needed to start producing children as soon as possible. Men and women wore out quickly in an environment of strenuous physical labor, so that they were physically equivalent at 35 to a modern person at 70 years old. Then there were the economic aspects, such as the constant need for manual labor because of the lack of machines we take for granted today, which leads to the concepts of slavery and serfdom, which leads to the economic benefits of early (and often) child bearing, with the Masters helping out in spreading the gene pool. And finally, there was the security benefits of a large population from which to raise and maintain armies. 
As far as rape, prior to our "more enlightened" times, say since the 1970s, there was no rape within a marriage. A wife was expected to meet her husband's sexual needs while also beginning to bear children. She had little in the way of rights or legal protections beyond the religious admonitions and the husband's needs of his wife's (or wives') non-sexual services. As far as rape, any unprotected woman was considered "fair game". A woman outside the bounds of family, where she was protected by her father, husband and/or brothers, had little legal/physical protection against rape. Certainly there were cultural and religious restrictions, but these had little effect. That's just the way things were. Forget Renaissance fairs and romance novels. The reality of medieval and Renaissance life was far dirtier, full of disease, death, violence, starvation, crime and oppression. 
It's in more fiction than you think
It's a fairly accurate portrayal of European society in the middle ages and sadly some places in modern times.

Bran (100%) and Arya or Sansa; not both girls. Jon is a 50-50.
I'm guessing Bran will make it to the end, and maybe Arya. I doubt Sansa will make it, and I suspect Jon will die in the war. 
I think Arya will realize she doesn't fit in the "new" Westeros, and will depart for the Western edge of the world like Queen Nymeria did.

With Lady dead, Sansa has no direwolf so she is a goner sooner or later

edit: I forgot that show-Bran stupidly killed off Summer so i don't know really, the show are such a different beast than the books. In the books tough, Sansa will go
Bran and Sansa.

I'm 50/50 when it comes to Jon, but Arya's a goner for sure. 
Jon - Will definitely be present during the war for dawn but I'm not sure if he'll survive that battle 

Arya - Dead

Sansa - Alive

Bran - Alive
I think it was to remind people that red priestesses are global. And that their effects spread far and wide.
It established Dany as a legitimate Azor Ahai/prince that was promised candidate to the characters. Obviously as the audience we already suspected she might be AA. I actually thought her interaction with Varys showed that there might be more to his story than we already know. We're bound to find out in S7.
It was just to establish her presence in the show. But I agree it felt out of place. Most casual watchers won't recognize her in Season 7 because she was literally only there for 1 scene
It parallels Cersei's attempt to use the Sparrows as a weapon against the Tyrells. Tyrion and Varys also use religion as a political tool, but in order to bring the city together rather than defeat their rivals.

Aside from that, it could be relevant in the future if Dany stops off in Volantis.

I am very intrigued by her conversation with Varys.  I have the feeling she will be a key to learn more about Varys and his motivations.
I was thinking they might use her to connect Dany to Melisandre, maybe like a "little birds" network of Lord of Light priestesses who talk to each other so that when Dany comes to Westeros Mel might already have heard of her.
The show isn't over. The red priests thinking Dany is a messiah may continue to be important in Seasons 7 and 8.
To prep the casuals for her appearance in Season 7.

If she changed Dany's approval in Mereen, then they can use that to justify Mereen not turning to shit after Dany leaves.  
If she's a popular ruler then people will follow her rules even after she's gone, at least for a little while.  
To say Dany is the one that was promised after Jon is declared by Mel?

Okay, I'm not serious with that. Just find it amusing that she has to say it. Not like casual viewer will know how important it is though.
More "womyn power fu*k yeah! " tropes. 

Literally everyone that has any sort of leadership is a woman know. Except Jon, who has it because Sansa is supporting him. But anyway.
Am I the only one who wants to see a Bitch fight between kinvara and mel? Maybe as wrinkly old women?
I wouldn't say we don't know a lot about these incidents, I would just like to know more...

The Conquest from POV of Aegon

Pre and during Red Wedding from POV of Walder Frey

Battle of the Trident from POV of Rhaegar
The Mad King's decent into madness

The life of the Three-Eyed Crow

Valyria before the fall
A lot of events have already been covered, in lore videos or outlined in the books themselves, but there's a couple things I wish we knew more about in general


Lann the clever taking Casterly Rock from house Casterly in the age of heroes


The lesser houses of the Riverlands, Stormlands, the Reach and the Vale and their histories


A deeper insight into the Targaryen rulers of Westeros, we all know about Aerys, Baelor, Aegon I, etc, I'm curious about the kings we don't often hear about
I have nothing specific to add to this, other than wouldn't it be nice if students were this excited about real life history? :) I know I'm more excited about GOT history myself, but there are SO many cool things that happened in real life, and I just haven't had the initiative to find out about them as much as GOT lore.
Could have used some more info on the food.
Seeing the first Blackfyre Rebellion in more detail would be really cool.
I wish we knew more about House Mormont.
1. I'd love to hear more about the story of the last hero traveling with his group to search for the children

2. Robert's Rebellion from Robert, Ned, and Rhaegar's POV

3. I'd like to get more info on the knights of history like Symeon Star Eyes, The Smiling knight, etc. to know a bit more about why they became so notorious


The Doom of Valyria and all events slightly proceeding it. Not just from the Targ perspective either, I want to actually see what it is, what caused it, and what happens to the city/people in it.

That and everything there is to know about Asshai.
For me it would be the ghiscari wars, the abduction of Lyanna Stark, and more about the origins of the white walkers.
The invasion of the Andals, the life and lore of the Three Eyed Raven, and the Age of a Heroes. 
Aegon's Conquest
Valyria, the prelude to and the Doom itself
Probably the Blackfyre Rebellions
The Doom of Valyria

The Blackfyre Rebellion
 
Beginning of Roberts Rebellion 
I believe these are to be explained in the planned prequel. I think most of my questions would involve the time before and shortly after Robert's rebellion.
Lyanna stark pov of tourney at harrenhall 

Jon arryn pov of his death

As a geologist, this made me tingle. As a GoT fan, I came twice.
Damn dude, that's incredible.

How did you sculpt it, clay & paint after?
That's sooo cool! How long did it take you?
Reminds me of the table at Dragonstone, great, great job!
I thought Dorne was less mountains and more flat desert! This really puts into perspective how difficult it would be to get an army together to fight a war there, but you also have to cut through this giant mountain shit anytime you need to get tf in or out???? I mean, I guess you could sail to and from from KL, but you have to cut through the Storm Lands and I'm pretty sure they're not named that because of their luxurious beaches. 
Bravo. 
Green stuff, terrain from spackle and acrylic paints. You wouldn't happen to be into the miniature wargaming hobby? Also this is fucking awesome
WHERE IS THE WALL? 
I made one of these too!  

[Here you can see the giant's view](http://i.imgur.com/kxNGgo1.jpg), looking down south from north of the wall.
Wow that's amazing. Are you planning to do the free cities as well?
I just got a poster of the map sent to me, but the resolution is so bad you can't make out the names of the areas. I was thinking of glueing it to a piece of plywood and doing just as you have done. I was hesitant, but this has inspired me! Looks great! 
This is very cool. Can someone label it with major cities so I have some context? I was never great with knowing exactly where things are in relation to each other in GoT.
It's pretty good, I guess, but why does it have bumps all over it?
This is very cool, I want one of these in my living room.
Daaamn, that is so cool. Great job.
 I never realised Dorne was so isolated from the rest... How do you get there ? 
Very impressive. 
Now you get to feel like Aegon on Dragonstone
Umm, please tell me I'm not the only one who JUST realized Westeros is a peninsula. The entire time I was watching the show, I wondered why the White Walkers didn't just walk around the wall. 

*facepalm* 
Paging r/CK2GameofThrones
Gall..... I want one so bad! I'm trying to wood burn one and its coming along
Whoa. Is this clay?
Damn that's very good.
A very good  concept 
If Dorne was green it would be a super defensible paradise
Great work m8
That is amazing looks incredible 
Great job!
Man this is awesome, good job!
Looks great.
Must have been hard work.
That's awesome! You, my friend, have just inspired me. I want one! 
I want this. No. I NEED this.
This is stunningly beautiful, great work!
That's amazing! I love the mountains. It really brings the Vale and the Prince's pass to life
How big is this? It looks pretty big.
That's just the U.K.   
Sexy
TIL there is a colossal mountain range between the 7 kingdoms and Dorne.
No scale bars, no contour lines — 0/10 OP, sorry mate.
What do you do for a living, is this a job skill or a hobby? Im imagining you making the topographical maps of mountain ranges for national parks or something badass like that. Great work  
I think that the Stormlands are a bit to mountaney. They are supposed to be stepped in the west and irish/northern hemisphere jungle in the east. 
That is really cool.  You did a great job on that.  👍🏻

It is very similar to the mobile game 'Godus'
Where was this?
Well, considering most smallfolk are going to be hearing about it second or third hand, I don't think what is true or not will matter much. I would think most people will assume it's just a bunch of mularkey to justify a new King on the Iron Throne.
At this point, I don't see how it would even matter. He is already king in the north. If it even gets revealed to the point that the whole realm knows, he would only potentially gain something (the throne) that he will probably get anyway.
I don't really think people care about what's true.
As Jorah Mormont once said "people pray for rain, healthy children and summer that never ends.. they don't care what games the high Lords play."
As long as Jon has a strong army at his back, he can claim whatever he wants.

So if he needs Someone to believe him, it'd be the Lords and Bannerman he needs.
What makes you think Bran will reveal anything to the people of Westeros
Samwell will probably also figure it out. Plus Bran can use his powers to show it aswell and lets not forget the Red Priests who show things in the flames. If Melisandre hears about it she will probably investigate specially after "The Red god only shows me snow" (or something along those lines). 
I foresee Bran living just long enough to pass the Wall, thus allowing the NK to tear it down, and then almost immediately die. I don't think Jon's parentage is going to end up mattering.. I think it's a huge red herring-- yes, everyone was right, but that doesn't mean it will matter and Jon will end up on the Throne, marry Dany, defeat the NK and run off into the sunset. 

That's just my opinion anyway, I could be wrong.
If Bran/Howland tell people that Jon is the Grandson of the guy who executed 2 Starks without trial, and is the son of a guy who kidnapped and raped their beloved lady, then they may perhaps not see him as a viable candidate for KITN. Personally, I see Sansa using it as a weapon to claim the North.

Jon's gonna do some dragony stuff, which'll be a better proof-of-lineage than a long-form birth certificate.
I don't think anyone other than a few characters will know. Jon, Dany, Barn, Meer, Sansa + Arya at the most will know. Possible Jaime after he kills Cersei
Well if it is possible that Rhaegar married Lyanna before he went of to the trident they would need a septon to officiate it. So is it possible that that marriage of the crown prince would have been recorded by that septon at the citadel for Sam to eventually find.
Also the septon wouldn't say anything because technically it was an illegal  marriage but recorded it as the war was going on
youre making the mistake of thinking Jon will give a shit whether or not hes a Targ

1. Roberts rebellion started after Mad King Aerys demanded Robert and Ned be sent to Aerys to be killed. 

2. Pycelle wanted Tywin to be king.

3. Can you clarify what you mean by more important character? 

4. No, Aerys laughed at Tywin for suggesting his daughter marry the Crown Prince. 

5. It's not that weird given that the city was being sacked. Also, the only people in the room when Aerys died were Aerys and Jaime, as Jaime had already killed the Pyromancer before he killed Aerys. 

6. Robert is made king because he won the Rebellion. His Targaryen ancestry just made him the head of the Rebellion. 

7. It's impossible to really know what would happen if the Lannisters didn't stay out of things until Robert had won. 

8. They were already betrothed to other people, namely Ned Stark and Jon Arryn. 
Alright, let's do this:

1. The prevailing theory is that Rhaegar and Lyanna loved each other and eloped together. He was convinced that their son would be the Prince That Was Promised; he likely shielded her from the world, especially after she became pregnant. He left the Kingsguard to protect not just Lyanna but their son as well. Who knows how much she knew about the rebellion and what happened to her father and brother; by the time Rhaegar left for the Trident she was likely already heavily pregnant. She would not have had the time nor the means to make a public declaration of their love.

2. Pycelle insisted he was loyal to the Lannisters (specifically Tywin) all along. He likely saw, as Tywin did, that the war was lost and wanted to be on the winning side. Pycelle's primary intention seemed to be keeping his comfortable, powerful position.

3. Jon Arryn was tremendously important to the history of Westeros. He sparked the rebellion by refusing to hand Robert and Ned (who he practically raised) over to the Mad King, and was by all accounts an excellent Hand (though unable to control Robert's wasteful spending). As far as status, he and Ned were equals as Wardens of the North/East and Hands of the King in their lifetimes. He's simply less important to our POV of the story because he dies before it begins.

4. Tywin proposed Cersei as a bride for Rhaegar but Aerys refused him. However, the event that caused Tywin to resign as Hand and leave King's Landing was Aerys appointing Jaime, Tywin's son and heir, to the Kingsguard, effectively disinheriting him. Cersei actually engineered this to avoid Jaime's betrothal to Lysa Tully, as she wanted more incestuous lovemaking time.

5. Jaime was the last remaining Kingsguard; the others were either at ToJ with Lyanna or had been leading troops and were now dead or captured. Aerys had been alone; he specifically summoned these two. He ordered Jaime to kill Tywin and Rossart to burn King's Landing to the ground.

6. Of the leaders of the rebellion, Robert was most closely related to the Targaryens, so he was the obvious choice to be king. They'd started the rebellion to overthrow the Mad King and rescue Lyanna; none of the rebel lords, Robert included, necessarily had designs on becoming king at the outset. Robert declared his intention to claim the throne shortly before the Battle of the Trident.

7. It's impossible to say for sure, but the Loyalists likely would've won out with the Lannisters' help. The Tyrell armies were tied up around Storm's End and Robert's Stormlanders were worn down after being pursued all over the Storm/Crown/Riverlands. The Battle of the Trident was essentially Stark/Arryn/Tully vs Targaryen/Martell. The Lannister armies could have tipped the balance, or even caught Robert before he was able to rendezvous with Ned's forces at Stoney Sept.

8. Catelyn and Lysa were betrothed to Ned and Jon on their way south to meet up with Robert's forces in order to secure Hoster Tully's help. They were married shortly after, before the Trident; at that point Lyanna was still alive and Robert still betrothed to her.
1. Roberts Rebellion started when the mad king killed Rickard Stark and his son, and then demanded that Jon Arryn brings him both Ned and Robert. Even if Lyanna loved him, Roberts wouldnt have backed down and his hate would just grow towards the Targaryens.
2. Pycelle always serves the best option he has in front of him. The mad kings days were numbered and he probably wanted to make a good expression on the next ruler in line.
3. Jon Arryn is a very big character, but we dont see much of him because the game of thrones show is based on the aftermath of all these things. Jon Arryn would have been a much bigger character to the audience if the show was based on the rebellion instead.
4. He had many reasons. Aerys was jelous of Tywin because the people credited him instead of the king for everything that was happening. Aerys jelousy drew him mad and he took Jaime as his Kings guard just to spite Tywin and prevent him from getting what he wanted. (Jaime being his heir) Tywin also didnt choose sides because he didnt want to pick the losing side. Once the war had been decided, he quickly acted and sacked Kings landing to make an impact on Robert.
5. ....

6. People was calling it Roberts Rebellion because he ended up the king. When Ned came to Kings landing after the sacking, he could have easily taken the role, but he didnt want it. Robert having Targ blood just made it easier for ppl to obey since they had been ruling for ages. Jon Arryn didnt want to become king either, cuz he had no heir. Robert was the only guy that wanted it.
7. Those are the big names yes, but its more fitting to say the north, the riverlands,stormlands etc.. since they have a bunch of lesser houses fighting for them aswell. And its hard to say what the outcome would have been, but Robert would have had a harder time winning it atleast.
8. Because Jon Arryn was the one who suggested that. Catelyn was already betrothed to Ned and Lysa to Jon Arryn, thats how the riverlands joined their side at the start of the Rebellion. One of the big houses that was left after the war that Robert didnt fully have on his side was the Lannisters. And he needed Tywins support(gold) in the years to come, as you saw in the show. Even with Tywins help, they still ended up in big debts.
Found an excellent clip for my number 2 question.

Didn't Robert offer the throne to Ned? I don't think he actually wanted to rule all that much.
1.The war was started because Aerys executed brandon and rickard stark then sent for the heads of Robert and ned to stop them retaliating,and Jon Arynn called his banners.

2.He wanted tywin to be king as he believed he was the best choice for the realm after ruling it well for many years

3.No

4.Cersei and Rhaegar are never betrothed.And tywin didnt stay loyal to the realm because Aerys slighted him at every turn and took his heir from him.

5.The city is under seige,all the great ladies are probably in same place as cersei was when it was under seige in season 2,the men are probably at the walls trying to defend it.

6.They used his targ blood to legitimise his takeover is all.

7.If the lannisters had sided with the crown,the crown would of won because tywin would of led the armies and he would of captured/killed Robert,at the moment jon conington failed to do it. 

8.Because he was betrothed to lyana,and Hoster Tully marries his daughters off to the north and vale to secure the alliance,he marries cersei to tie the lannisters to the new governance 
1. Robert's Rebellion started after the deaths of Rickard and Brandon, and when Aerys demanded Ned and Robert's heads. And its kinda obvious that Lya and Rhaegar were in love. We don't know if Lyanna knew of Brandon and Rickard's deaths (though I think she did because she asked Ned to bury her next to Brandon), we don't know why Rhaegar and Lyanna didn't proclaim their love. 

2. Pycelle is looking out for number 1. He thought Tywin would be A) a better king, and B) wanted to keep his position.

3. Jon Arryn is important, but not as important to the narrative than Ned.   

4. Cersei was never betrothed to Rhaegar, Tywin thought Aerys would say yes, so he told Cersei that she was. 

5. The Red Keep was under attack, so it was chaos, and Jamie was the last of the KG in King's Landing, so it made sense that he was the only one with the king.

6. The Targaryen blood was just an excuse for Robert to take the throne. It didn't really matter.

7. We don't know.

8. Cat and Lysa were already married.  
Catelyn and Lyra were already married when the Rebellion was over.

Robert had spent most of that time in the South and had no way of contacting Hoster Tully for a marriage proposition.

I personally believe that the man we saw in the flash back was the FIRST WHITE WALKER but not the Nights King we see in the show, but as to your questions
1. I believe that he has the power to reincarnate the dead as we allready know but also that he can not only manipulate materials like ice but perhaps be immune somehow to some of the magics of the children like for example theyre fireballs
2. As i havent read all the books yet i cannot say for sure but i believe that the biggest details to the story will remain even though the show now has surpassed the books.
Why is "Ned" wearing a crown and the Lannister sigil? Was the artist just going for total immersion in the cat theme?
seeing this just makes me sad about the perished direwolfes, only ghost and nymeria are still alive and its a matter of time before they go too

edit: just to make it clear, i am still getting into the books so i didnt know both summer and shaggydog were still alive there, my mistake, sorry.
I have no clue who's supposed to be Arya and who's Bran.
The only problem with this is that most of them don't look anything like the characters, either show or book. Combined with the Direwolf Sigil facing left and being cut off, making it look like a generic lion, this barely looks Game of Thrones related. 
It's because of shit like this Theon had a crisis, where is he in the picture?
this is just weird, I dont think the artist knows much about the series
Pepperidge Farm remembers... 
Missing Theon too, which I know given the other problems in the picture this is a tiny point, but still :-)
Poor Jon 
Why is Grey Wind brown?
For some reason this reminds me of Maplestory.
so that looks like Robert Beratheon in the background with a lion on his chest? and if it's meant to be Ned then it's even worse.  
Nymeria will sit the iron throne.
No Theon?
why is ned and cat wearing crowns?
All credit goes to [Vega](http://veganya.deviantart.com/).
Needs Theon skeemin in the back 
plot twist: this is Jon and Sansa at the end of the series. Note the crowns and the lack of Theon.
Its so ironic how OP has Bolton sigil!
Grey Wind is the wrong color.
If i was in game of thrones.

my house words would be, "the Zorse remembers" and my sigil would be a grinning Zorse. 
no Hodor :(
Ooo I 'member!
This is the cutest thing I have ever seen.
At first, I thought, "Where is Arya? And why is there another boy?" Then I realized Arya was the other boy and that this picture is perfect in every way.
Nice painting and all...
But how the hell are you supposed to know who is who?
cute style
This is mad cute. Excellent art.
This reminds me of a classic Peanuts Puzzle.
The feels
Yes. Tha North does remember indeed. A time for wolves is close.
why u do dis?
Dammit, we've lost so many direwolves. :(
Yeah, stand in the corner and sulk you little emo, Jon.
This makes me wonder if lyanna asked rhaegar, "do you wanna build a Snow man?"
I thought most of the children had red hair, and not brown-ish hair?
Oh yeah... Rickon was a thing...
Why is it marked spoiler everything?
Reminds me of code name kids next door
this is just weird
'Member Hodor??
Where is theon?
I 'member!
Ned has the Lannister crest O.o. As far as I know Ned's kids are Robb, Sansa, Bran, Arya, Rickon, and his foster son Jon. Why is there an extra boy in the family?
Ooooh the North members? I member! Oooh member Ned Stark? Member Greatjon?

Hmm. I saw it as the next generation. It's Sansa with Jamie Lannister, which is super weird. Jon off to the side, a new pack of direwolves arrived  with the new Stark kids?

Or someone just f'ed up.
Everything's beautiful and nothing hurts!

Humans, mostly Wildlings but also anyone who was in the Night's Watch. They can raise animals too, though we've only seen a few horses. As far as we know, they are not capable of raising Children of the Forest.
No such thing exists in the books. The "Night King" in the show was created specifically for the show.
Yea as Alde said, its mostly wildlings since he haven't passed the wall yet. 
There's a bear in the books so yeah

There are pictures in which you can see a few stark soldiers' shields, but that makes up only a few since, I believe, the starks sent men to fight the wildlings occasionally.
Ice Spiders, giants, mammoths, bears, free folk, others.
I feel like dead direwolf=dead Stark. They are really pushing that parallel. And as we know from Jaqen, death is certain, the time is not. So I think Sansa dying is the most plausible. Sure Summer is also dead, but since Bran is now the 3 Eyed Raven, he has plot armor. 
I think Sansa's toast. Not sure how, not sure when, but I'm fairly confident. This relationship with Littlefinger could be the start of her demise
Arya based on some book foreshadowing. They'll find you frozen with a needle in you hand. Her sword is named needle. Jon may have said it in the first season of the show.  I don't remember. 
Arya is pretty safe so just to fuck with us, Jon dies anyway right at the end. 
Robb
If it has to be anyone, I would be okay with Sansa dying.
I think Arya will end up dying unfortunately
Hope that is Sansa. Arya is badass
I could totally see GRRM killing off Jon just to fuck with everyone. Resurrected, only to die a meaningless death - perfect.
There's only 3 people left I think they will all live if any one dies though it would be John because he's about to go to war
I think Arya will be the last stark death in the series and i think her death like the ending will be bittersweet.

Targaryens are not immune to fire. Viserys Targaryen burned to death in a major and memorable scene.

I'll never understand why so many price recall the lantern without remembering Viserys screaming in agony while molten gold is poured on his head in a pivotal scene.
Targaryens aren't fireproof many have died by fire. In the books Daenerys burns herself so her fireproof superpower is something the show runners made up and she's the only that is fireproof. 
Targeryans are meant to have high heat resistance and that when Dany walked into the fire at the end of season 1, it was meant to be a one off thing. Other than that she can touch things that are pretty hot that others can't

I think the showrunners have just decided "Well we're just gonna confuse them if this heat hurts her and this heat doesn't, whats going on?" So it looks like they've just let her be fireproof to make it easier for the audience to understand.

Sorry for the late response, the real simple explanation of Daenerys fire resistance in the show and not in the books is due to the end game.

Nessa Nessa helps forge lightbringer by bearing her brest and allowed her husband to plunge a blade in her heart. Daenerys in the show for all Visual and story telling purposes is the self personification of fire (living fire).  Now the books have thousands of pages of text that can tell a different story, in TV you need to also use visuals because "scripts"  are no where near the word usage/detail/storytelling.

Maybe in the books Dany will be sacrificed out of "love" "passion" etc, but in the television show we may not get the time to build up a decent/believable relationship between jon and dany (endgame) to make lightbringer.

Having Dany be the "living flame"  in the television show would make it believable that jon could forge lightbringer using dany.


TL;DR Short Version
Dany = fire //
Jon = Azorhi //
Jon kills Dany "maybe because bran tells him he has to" I dont know, but I feel this is where the story goes.

Dany's fire-immunity thing was a one-time magical occurrence at Drogo's funeral pyre in the books, she survived unburnt and hatched the probably fossilized dragon eggs by inadvertently casting some sort of blood-magic spell with the sacrifice of the witch woman. 

In the show she's shown to have immunity to heat and fire on multiple occasions, like not being burnt by very hot surfaces or hot water in S1. My guess is this was included so they could hint to her being special and stronger than she looked without her internal monologue. 

She again showed herself to be immune to flames when she came out of the Dothraki hut unharmed.  

In the book, Dany is just as sensitive to heat/flame on other occasions as anyone else, and so are other Targaryens.

In the show, Viserys is shown to be sensitive to heat and flame, and he dies from severe burns.

So it seems in the show world other Targaryens are sensitive to heat and flame, it's just that Dany's special somehow.
WoW just confirmed that Sam will heal Jorah's greyscale.
As I don't really have deep knowledge of the book plots, but might  it be that they will try to give Gendy the Aegon/Young Griff plot? It's a huge tangent, but it wouldn't be too difficult to actually pull it 'close enough' for that, wouldn't it?  
I think Jon is going to lead a team to go capture a wight to bring to kings landing. This could very well be our team. The only thing that seems out of place is Gendry. His role in all of this is a total mystery. 
I think Gendry is back because Davos knows about the heritage of Gendry.  Like a Stark, Ser Davos Seaworth always does what he feel to be right and that would be seeing Gendry legitimized and taking the Iron Throne.  Jon is as honorable as they come and in the eyes of the North, a true king.  According to what Jon knows, Gendry is a bastard just like Jon and if legitimized, he is the actual heir to the throne.  

In this way I think you might actuall see Dany and Gendry get married for political reasons.  I say this because I think Jon will not survive the show all the way to the end of season 8 or he will kind of do a self imposed exile in the far north.

Tyrion: Father...I wish to confess...I wish...TO CONFESS!

Tywin: You wish to confess?

Tyrion: I saved you. I saved this city. And all your worthless lives. I should have let Stannis kill you all.

Tywin: Tyrion, do you wish to confess?

Tyrion: Yes, father, I'm guilty. Guilty, is that what you want to hear?

Tywin: You admit you poisoned the king?

Tyrion: No, of that I'm innocent. I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime, I'm guilty being a dwarf.

Tywin: You are not on trial for being a dwarf

Tyrion: Oh, yes I am. I've been on trial for that my entire life.

Tywin: Have you nothing to say in your defense?

Tyrion: Nothing but this. I did not do it. I did not kill Joffrey but I wish that I HAD! Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than a thousand lying whores! I wish I was the monster you think I am. I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you. I would GLADLY give my life to watch you all swallow it!

Tywin: Ser Meryn, Ser Meryn escort the prisoner back to his cell!

Tyrion: I will NOT give my LIFE for Joffrey's murder, and I know I'll get no justice here, so I will let the gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat.

"When the dead men or worse come hunting, do you think it matters whose sitting on an iron throne" -Jeor Mormont (probably didn't get the quote right and it may only be in the show but either way this always felt like a summary of the entire Game of Thrones story. The iron throne is a red herring and it doesn't matter who sits on it bc real enemies are coming and will dismantle the whole idea of it)

Unoriginal, but true haha 
There are a ton of lines I will never forget, but the biggest and most unforgettable one is the entire scene of Catelyn begging for Robb's life at the Red Wedding. 

C: Lord Walder, enough! Let it end! Please. He is my son, my first son! Let him go, and I swear we will forget this! I swear it by the old gods and new, we will take no vengeance! 

W: You already swore me one oath right here in my castle. You swore by all the gods your son would marry my daughter! 

C: Then take me for your hostage, but let Robb go. (to Robb) Robb, get up! Get up and walk out! Please! ***Please!***

W: And why would I let him do that?

C: (holding a knife to Joyuse or whatever her name was) On my honor as a Tully, on my honor as a Stark, let him go, or I will cut your wife's throat!

[pause]

W: I'll find another. 

R: (slowly stands up, defeated.) Mother...

Roose: The Lannisters send their regards. (stab, Robb dies)

Catelyn screams, kills Joy...then stares off into nowhere with dead eyes before she is killed as well. 

-----
That entire scene is burned into my memory forever. That scream still makes me shiver...

Cersei's monologue in The Winds of Winter right before she gives Septa Unella to Ser Gregor to be tortured: "I do things because they feel good. I drink because it feels good. I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him. I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me. I lie about fucking my brother because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites. I killed your High Sparrow and all his little sparrows, all his septons, all his septas. All his filthy soldiers. Because it felt good to watch them burn. It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain. No thought has ever given me greater joy. Even confessing feels good, under the right circumstances."

Wow
Off the wiki and fire page for Bran.
That's some serious cash. S7 has a budget of maybe around 14-16 million an episode.

If all 5 a tiers are in one episode that accounts for 5.5 million out of that budget. Then the b tier needs to be paid. Followed by the c tier. I imagine not much is left for vfx and shit
"Hey guys maybe you shouldn't kill me off this season... I need a new mansion."
Well considering Lena Headey was broke about 4 years ago, she must be pretty happy! 
They deserve it!  I'm really happy for Peter Dinklage especially! :)  I couldn't imagine the show without him.
Shit, Seinfeld made that money 20 years ago. That's chump change for TV. The cast of Friends, himym, etc.
So....15.4 million for next 14 episodes. Noooot bad. 
its the most popular show on the planet. they deserve it
WORTH!
so this means Cersei and the rest make it through to season 8?
Those who survive season 7 will probably be at 1.5 million by the final season.
Why aren't Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams included with the A-tier actors?

I never would have guessed Jaime was a tier-1 character. Sansa or Arya before him, surely?
so THAT is why they changed it to 7 episodes per season

Three stark siblings reunite, jorah and sam. I couldn't be more happier. and what a relieve hearing about Sansa's "you-know-what" status.  
If I'm seeing that picture of Dragonstone correctly, it looks like a giant meteorite.  That would make perfect sense since other meteorites from the Nissa Nissa legend were thought to be dragons.
I really hope that little finger tries to get in between the two sisters and Arya kills him in some way saving Sansa and showing that the Starks will stay together.

I'm really disappointed with the way the Arya/Sansa reunion is going to go. With everything they've both been through you'd have thought they'd give anything to see each other again. But no, once they meet they won't have grown up and matured that little extra bit needed to put the past behind them, and instead end up catfighting.. over *ruling*?! I mean neither of them are going to be ruling anything, besides Winterfell itself I guess. Jon's the one having to do the ruling, not them. Besides, Arya wasn't/isn't the kind of girl that wanted to marry or rule or do any of that stuff, so why now? Ugh. Why can't they just have a lovely peaceful reunion for once? And littlefinger's just going to make it worse no doubt. Hopefully they open their eyes and kill him before he ruins their relationship for good...
Not by much, the TV series has caught up to everyone's storylines unless they were killed off in the TV series, in which case there's a bit of their book story that hasn't been caught up to yet.
Let me think about it...I'm bored at work so I'll indulge.

Jon, Arya, Sansa, Cersei, Davos, Stannis, Bran, Melisandre, Daenerys, Tyrion, Theon, Yara/Ahsa, Barristan, Jorah, Margaery, Littlefinger: All of them are past their stories in the books, more or less.

Jaime and Brienne, their plot lines are kind of up in the air. We don't know if their implied book plots are still going to be important down the road, if the show will get them there somehow or if they just skipped over some things entirely. I know that one aspect of their plot lines is not going to be in the show at this point. But maybe the outcomes will come about a different way. I'm trying to be vague, but ultimately I just don't know what to think of their plot. Brienne is kind of in the right area. Jaime is very far removed.

Sam Tarly, he's the only one that still has a chapter or so of book stuff left to do. But it's nothing that can't be glossed over or reworked into a 5 minute scene. I would say he's pretty much caught up.

Hope I didn't forget anything or unintentionally spoil anything. 
It's been a good while since I read the books but I think Sam is a tiny bit further in the books than he is in the show (also a certain faceless man).

Pretty sure the TV is ahead in a couple of areas 
I think he'll end up sacrificing himself to save a Stark's life. 
One of GoTs biggest subtext's is all about arrogance, every major death so far has been because of arrogance, Ned and Oberan being good examples.

Theons story I reckon when you boil it right down is about his fall through arrogance and his rise through humility. If he doesn't sacrifice himself for Sansa or his sister he may very well be the last man standing.
He still has a redemption arc to go through.
Not Theon, Reek. 
In the books he's still around because he can validate who any Stark is and invalidate the Kingsmoot because he wasn't there and didn't get a chance to press his claim. For the show... seems like he's there because he's interesting and hasn't died in the books. He could have died when Brienne showed up to take care of Sansa but if the Iron Born are going to be involved in the future plot, which seems likely, he definitely makes it more interesting and meaningful than if it was just Yara/Asha leading the resisting faction. 
Well in the show I have no idea but in the books I think he will re-take a dragon from his uncle after his uncle uses Dragon-binder  if it works
I like to think in the origins of his name, that is related to de drowned god (theon=godly; greyjoy=kinda a drowned devout of the god). He might regain some faith in god and end as the new priest. 

Theon is already a person that endured so many things... he becaming Reek can be considered his death, and then he ressurrected as Theon again. Like the words of the drowned god: "What is dead may never die, but rises again, harder and stronger." But without a dick. I think the drowned god have his limitations.
Wouldnt it be crazy if Winterfell gets occupied by Others, and Theon sneaks over the walls to find something hidden in the crypts?
I still consider Theon to be at least 50% a Stark, that alone is enough reason for his story to matter IMO.  
I'm not sure where he will end up, I think that he might end up dying on behalf of the Starks, or that he will have a large influence on the kind of leader that his sister will be.  
Theon is a character on his own, he already was main cause for some of the storyline's more important events. Does he have to receive a grand porpoise in the end?
I don't think there's anything left for him. He played a part in major story developments, but he probably won't have a huge endgame like some other major characters. 
Redemption.  I think hes gonna make a huge comeback to make up for the regret he feels for betraying his boy Robb and the Starks. The family that loved him like their own. 
I think he either lives thru it all or dies a heroes death.

My favorite and one that is always in the back of my mind.

"Kill the boy, and let the man be born."
A lion doesn't concern himself with the opinion of a sheep
When Jaime was speaking to Cersei about him potentially becoming Hand of the King he said,

"There's an honor I can do without, their days are too long, their lives are too short."

Just applying that principle to my own job mentality. Work is a means to an end, a way to support your family. I never want it to make my days terribly long and in the process lead to a shorter life.
"'Power resides where men believe it resides. No more no less.' 'So power is a mummers trick?' 'A shadow on the wall, yet shadows can kill. And ofttimes a small man can cast a very large shadow"

I'm a small guy so to me this quote is inspiring but it even goes beyond physical appearance. This quote is aimed at Tyrion but it also can be applied to anyone who comes from nothing a "small" man aka Littlefinger. It's incredible to me just how many great quotes GRRM has created
1. Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder. Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them. And some, are given a chance to climb. They refuse, they cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is. 
(just replace chaos with 'reddit')

The world is a chaotic place, people make mistakes, people die, people vote wrong, and act wrong and do stupid things for stupid reasons. Chose your spots, wait for your openings and climb. 

2. Any man who must say "I'm the King" is no true King.

Pride and position are no substitutes for actual power and intelligence.
Not today.

-Victarion Greyjoy

Also, both sides of a dialogue between Victarion and Euron:

>Perhaps we can fly. All of us. How will we ever know unless we leap from some tall tower? No man ever truly knows what he can do unless he dares to leap.

-Euron

>There is the window. Leap.

-Victarion
"Don't worry about your death. Worry about your life." -LF
"Wear it like armor"
When I'm in need of some Baratheon stubbornness:

"We march to victory, or we march to defeat. But we go forward, only forward."
'I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men.'

Two words. Syrio Forel
"Never forget what you are, The rest of the world will not, Wear it like armor, and it can never be used to hurt you."

This quote made me so much more self aware.
"Might have punctured a lung, if he had a lung. Most trees don't, as a rule."

Can you be a superfan of this show without being a little scared of what comes next?
The only one it's gone well for is Dany, who's entered Mary Sue territory. 

The North turned its back on the Starks, the wildlings had to be convinced by Tormund and Wun Wun to fight for Jon after he gave his life for them, Bran lost Hodor and Summer, Arya was beaten and tortured throughout the season and lost a newly-made friend (again), Rickon, Osha and Shaggydog were killed after being betrayed by Stark bannermen, Jon's recklessness got most of his men killed and he was saved by the man who destroyed his family whom he now owes a debt to, Arya's gone full psycho and Wun Wun is dead. Jon being made King pales in comparison to the shit his family has been through throughout the past six seasons. It doesn't help that The North Forgot. 
Maybe i'm just ptsd i don't know
Definately, Kit Harington came out and said the next two seasons will be very "bleak". Also we know that the ending itself will have some tragedy to it. I think everything good that will happen in the last 3 seasons all happened in season 6 and the next two will be a lot 'sadder'.
What happens? I haven't read the books. 
I am definitely terrified for the upcoming season. I mean, I love Sansa, but I don't see anything happening to her yet. 

I am scared for Dorne and for the Tyrell family. Super nervous. I have been, somewhat foolishly, purchasing mugs/coasters/keychain, etc. with the Martell and Tyrell family symbols on them. Haha. I am proverbially putting all my eggs in one basket. 
Well, considering those are about the only characters left...it's going to go badly for some of them. I am sure that it won't go as easily for Dany as they are making it look like it will. The Lannister's probably have more options than most people think. Power is power, and there are still plenty of houses that follow power. 

The Tyrells, Baratheons, and Starks are all very weak at the moment. I could easily see the Lannisters sweep in to take control over Tyrell controlled lands. It's an easy take with everyone gone, and it would be easy to see other houses in that area follow the Lannisters. The Baratheons are leaderless and Jaime could push their Armies south to secure the Stormlands. The Starks don't have the men to invade the south, nor should they since they have a big problem with Littlefinger and his fresh Knights of the Vale army just hanging around...I am sure they will try and make a pact with the Dragon Queen. I mean Dany gonna look at Jon's baby dick and know he da one.

 
I'm looking forward to seeing what happens now that Dorne and the Tyrells are out to get Cersei.
Please don't kill any of the Lannisters! I love them!
Nah. Personally I'm rooting for the White Walkers. 
I know people say this every season but I'm scared for tyrion

No, I think Meera is the daughter of Howland Reed.
No, I don't think so. I think Meera's warrior skills are more the result of the mindset and life of the crannogmen. Meera's skill isn't described as anything extraordinary as far as I remember - she could just be decent with weapons because the crannogmen don't have the anti-women bias most of Westeror (minus Dorne) has.
Had this same little thought while watching the new Histories and Lore videos. Idk if it'll happen or not, but it is fun to think about.
She can't be the next wielder of the ~~Sword of the Morning~~ Dawn, right? Seeing as how she's not a Dayne. 

Edit: And she wouldn't even be a Dayne if she were the daughter of Ashara. She'd be a Sand. 

Edit 2: The wielder of Dawn is called The Sword of the Morning. 
I have thought this for a while now. This is my thought...Ashara gave birth to Brandon's daughter and perhaps Ned planned to marry her to keep her honor. Only that plan was all fucked up by Brandon dying so Ned had to marry Cat. I think that Reed went with Ned to Starfall to return the sword and they faked her death while she ran away with Howland Reed and baby Meera to Greywater Watch where they have stayed ever since. To me that explains why we don't have any information on Meera's mom other than her name being Jyanna. And why Howland hasn't come out since he got home from the war. Truly makes you wonder...and poor Ned was there to clean up everyone's messes. Claimed one as his own and sent one somewhere to be kept safe cause really how could he possibly explain two babies different sizes uh....hi Cat...uh I was really busy while I was gone. Here's my bastard son and daughter!!

Alliser was not a member of the Kingsguard. Aerys had Ser Barristan the Bold, Prince Lewyn Martell, Ser Jaime the Kingslayer, Lord Commander Gerold Hightower, Ser Oswell Whent, Ser Arthur Dayne the Sword of the Morning, and Ser *Jonothor* Darry. Alliser was just a general for the Targaryen side.

Jaime is going to create Lightbringer by killing Cersei. 
Maybe not so much a "theory" but I love the idea of Rickon living as a feral, untamed kid among cannibals and unicorns on Skagos with his Shaggydog. I want him to be the most nature-kid Stark to ever live & not die immediately like in BoTB

But for legitimate theory I think Bran is going to "mount" one of Dany's dragons through warging & Arya will complete her list before dying in the snow with someone else's face on, never to be found
If we will see the mystical Lightbringer in the story, it's gonna be Oathkeeper. Just something I felt was strongly hinted at in ASOS and AFFC whenever the sword is talked about.
The ending will be more sweet than bitter.
Rheago didn't actually die at birth and will appear at some point.
bran is the night king
Nymeria will return and reunite with Arya!!  
Also, the show will have a mostly happy ending.  
I don't believe it true because of the fortune the Witch gave young Cersei but my favorite fan theory is that Gendry is the first, and only, son of Robert and Cersei, whom Cersei believes is dead. 
Not a thoery, but THE MANNIS LIVES!
Bran sent the "catspaw" assassin to kill himself in book/season 1 through his greenseeing in order to trigger many of the events that followed, despite the awful things that occurred because of it, because it's the only way to somehow lead to the defeat of the White Walkers. 

The assassin was so sure that nobody else was supposed to be in that room - almost as if he had been told about things in the future that had come to fruition multiple times and that this was the first time something was off. He was deceived by Bran, the Whisper on the Wind. 
Hot Pie is the Prince That Was Promised.
Jojen Paste. It's not all that crazy actually, but still.
Jaime and Cersei are not Tywin's kids. Tyrion is Tywin's only son.

Bran does not play a major role going forward.

Several people knew Jon Snow was not Ned's bastard and knew his parent's were R & L.


Bran will use his powers to control the dragons in order to save the world...
Ser Pouce is the Prince that was Promised.

Jon becomes the night king
Ned stark is still alive.
Ned Stark is alive. you will see...you will all see...
That the night queen is buried under winterfell, but she will escape because Ned buried his sister in the crypt, whose body will allow the night queen to escape and reek havoc on the north. 
Hmmm...probably that when the The Wall falls, Bran will sacrifice himself by using the greensight to kill himself in the past (when Jaime pushed him out of the tower) in order to prevent the knock-on effect that his survival had and thus give Westeros a strong and united army to oppose the White Walkers.
Arya will have to create lightbringer by killing Jon.  She will stick him with the pointy end.
The Iron Bank is discreetly masterminding it all and slowly setting the board to rule all over the world

Series ends with Bran sitting on the Iron Throne, his entire family and all of his friends dead from the battle with the White Walkers, the weight of rebuilding the 7 kingdoms on his shoulders, sitting in the same pose as Ned on the season 1 boxart, possibly with Ghost by his side
Jon Snow is a Targaryen...
Now, this refers more to the books than to the show, but I don't actually believe that there are gods in this world, just different kinds of magic that people started to associate with different alleged deities. "Oh look, we managed to do something, and because we don't know how, it must surely be because of some higher power! Fire? Probably some Fire god, praise him!" I guess you could say that the Old Gods do exist, but I believe that they're just the remnants of past Greenseers who are long gone. Now, in the show, it's a bit different, since Varys supposedly heard voices in the flames. Of course, it could be nothing, but eh, the show's the show.

I'm also a fan of the Grand Maester conspiracy theory, though I don't believe that every Maester is in on it, since that wouldn't be practical in the slightest.
Jon Snow is going to create Lightbringer with Daenerys, and the sword will suck Danys warmth, transforming her into a white walker. And than she go in a jouney to the land of always winter, to reunite with the other nissa nissa's, the crones of past azor ahai's.
When Brienne accompanies Cat back to Robb's camp, after Jamie has escaped killing his cousin and Lord Karstarks son, the soldiers are fighting to kill and defend him - Brienne says, "who wants to die defending a Lannister?" - erm, I would bet good money that you would now, Brienne.
Bran is the Red God. He is able to influence his followers using his powers.  He makes mistakes.

He has Melisandre burn Shireen to be able to save her from greyscale.  She actually teleported Shireen to the place where Sam is(because she was burned) and healed her before saving Jon.  Bran was actually testing Stannis who failed the test.  Shireen becomes a powerful red witch: her and Sam use the library to research how to defeat the white walkers and their undead army.

Their is a connection between dragons and greyscale which will become important to the ending.


Jorah is azor ahai and will win the game
Meera reed is jons snows twin sister
[deleted]
Sansa + Jon
Weird thing is I was thinking about this the other day. Bran could go back to Winterfell and instead of telling Jon his true parentage he takes Jon into a vision (if that's possible) and then Ned tells Jon himself 
Reasons I could not be the 3ER. #1 I would mainly use my power to watch people have sex.
 I don't think it needs to be anything to do with Jon's parentage. (Bran knows Jon is Lyanna's son - wouldn't he guess who the father is when everyone knows Lyanna was 'kidnapped' by Rhaegar).  It could be something to inspire or inform Bran in another way. Ned was one of my favourites too and one more scene with him would be fantastic - it would probably make me cry actually.

Well bran does have visions of ned in the books.I could see them doing a scene or 2,and i agree it would be cool.I think if anything though  it will be more young ned rather then sean bean 
RIP to my first favorite character in the series.
What I'd really like to see is Catelyn somehow learning that Ned had never betrayed her. Not sure how it would ever be possible, but man, would that ever heal some old wounds
Assuming that there aren't any scheduling conflicts, I can't see Sean Bean refusing to return for a small scene.  
So yeah I think that there's a fair chance that this will happen, if we see Bran having more visions of the past.
I feel like Bran showed up when Ned was about to get his head cut off.  If you re-watch the scene, you see Ned's confused initial look, then sudden talking to himself..  it fits.  Bran may have been coaching him to warg into that pigeon overhead or he was asking for info.
Meh, while I like the box art, I'd much rather buy each individual Blu-Ray so I don't end up with a box set for Seasons 1-6 and then individual copies for Seasons 7 (and maybe 8)

I think Season 1-5 are on sale for 79.99 too. Then Season 6 for 40 bucks or so. Correct me if I'm wrong. 
Does anyone know if this set includes the remastered Atmos audio?
George R.R Martin should write.
This is what I hoped the Telltale GoT game would be. But your choices don't make as much a difference as I hoped, so it's basically a visual novel more than anything else.
GRRM finish writing a book?
No, George R.R. Martin should write The Winds of Winter and A Dream of Spring. 
I think he should just finish the books in his original story, that he started over 20 yrs ago...
After I finished reading the books, I looked for CYOA books with a similar story. I have found a fun CYOA book called "Magium" (on Android) and it's pretty good. Call me crazy, but I like it as much as ASOIAF!

(r/Magium for anyone wondering)

Reminds me of Fighting Fantasy series, especially Deathdrap Dungeon by Ian Livingstone.

Also the Lone Wolf series by Joe Dever.

Good old times.....
Telltale.
For it to be a real GRRM choose-your-own-adventure book, the situation should be completely unwinnable. Accept the fact you will be dead at the end. The only question is how and what difference you make another the way.
Interactive fiction for asoiaf could be very interesting.
Read the books, pick a favorite character, imagine you are him, boom choose your own adventure because no matter what you are ending up on page 162 and killed
Politics, man.  It might not buy him the love of Robert, but it's a powerful message still.  

He stayed out of the war until very late on.  When the tide was turning against Aerys, though, he needed to act.  Otherwise he'd have been the Hand of the King, and have nothing tying him to the new king.  Maybe even be on his bad side, and risk his power.  On the other hand, if he moves now, he can 'help' with the sack of King's Landing.  Robert is now indebted to him.  Tywin won't control the throne, but his ~~wife~~ *daughter* will be queen, and his grandchildren will be on the throne.

EDIT: Daughter, not wife.  
IMO it was for two reasons. 

1. To make a good impression to Robert Barratheon. He knew Robert wanted the Targs extinct and wanted to get in good with the new regime.

2. Revenge. Out of the slight for Aerys turning down his proposal to wed Ceresi to Raegar. I don't remember exact words but he pretty much called Lannisters peasants, bad idea when you are begging for allies.
Tywin always believed the Lannisters should be a house to be *feared*. As others have pointed out, he needed to demonstrate his loyalty to the new king (Robert), but he also wanted to establish House Lannister's position in the new, post-Targ realm. Taking the capital with ruthless efficiency prevented a complete takeover of the halls of power by a coalition of Northern, Vale and Riverlands houses that could have seen the Lannisters sidelined to being just the Crown's bankers. Jon Arryn knew how important it was to have Tywin on Robert's side, which is why he suggested he and Cersei marry. 
"we had come to late to Robert's cause, we had to show our loyalty"...said Tywin Lannister. There you have it.
His son and house power and influence 
This is one of those things that has nagged me too. A plausible reason I think it could be is that Kings landing is a notoriously vile place once you are outside the red keep. Maybe Tywin always hated the way it was but Aerys never let him clean the place up. So he shows up to take the city for Robert to declare his loyalty for him and get rewarded and decides to just sack the place in the hopes that its rebuilt better than it was. Pure speculation though.
Simple: He had to prove allegiance to Robby B. before the war ended so he...ended the war for him (RB).
I'd say it was a show of force on Tywin's part. We was willing to sack King's Landing; what would he do to your castle if your house stood against his in the following power vacuum? It was also a way to align himself fully to Robert as he was pretty blood thirsty and wanted those who were "at fault" to pay in with their lives. Being that the whole of the royal family was to blame the capitol, by extension, was to blame as well. 
Can you give the podcast you listened to a mention? 
I think sacking the city was a means to kill the mad kings wife and family. Doing this dirty work for robert surely swayed him more than taking an already failing keep, plus Tywin had a vendetta against the mad king. Tywin risked almost nothing, so any benefit he got from sacking kings landing makes since.
Among multiple factors I think the most important not mentioned here is that he did it for his line. Jamie as a member of the Kingsguard would die defending Aerys. If he sat around and did nothing, he would have lost his son and thus his male line would have ended. He would have no direct descendants named Lanister. You could argue that Tyrion was also his heir but we all know what Tywin thought about him and I would say there are some questions about his lineage that are still lingering that perhaps Tywin knew.
Ah yes. I love these theory breakdown threads. 

**cracks knuckles**

Tywinn hated the Targaryens. He was in their service because it was expected of him as Warden of the west and he was de facto the most powerful man as hand of the King. It served him well to keep his enemies close.

His hatred must've intensified (if not catalyzed) in the early days early of his marriage to Joanna Lannister (his 1st cousin) when King Aerys made a crude remark in regards to the first night tradition. He basically said he'd like to exercise his rights as King to fuck T-dogs new wife. 

He basically said he'd like to exercise the old tradition of being the highest lord in the land to fuck the newlywed. A tradition that had since been banned (or discontinued? I'm still hazy on that detail).

(Don't get me started on the Bolton scandal).

Because Aerys couldn't fuck her he groped her A LOT in the bedding ceremony. Because ... what the fuck you gonna do about it? I'm king, bitch.

Shortly after their wedding Rhaella Targaryen dismissed Joanna Lannister from her service because there were rumours that Aerys may have taken her virginity. Even though Pycelle insists that the rumours were just that, rumours, we ALL know Aerys fucked her and there was no one else at the time besides (maybe) a Targaryen who Tywin thought worthy of the Lannister name. So he married Joanna anyway.

Tywin didn't quit the handship. He was fired. Publicly he let the people know that he was just tired and wished to retire to Wardenship. Privately he was asked to resign by a mad and paranoid king.

With Robert's rebellion looming and tides turned against the Targaryens, he sought vengeance for the mistreatment of his late wife and at the same time felling a half century old dynasty in a quick and decisive manner so as not to further splinter the nation. This is when the incident happenned to Ellia Martel and her children at the hands of the mountain. He was to exterminate the Targaryens and extinguish their lines forver. Fortunate for Rhaella, her unborn daughter Danny and her young son Viserys and unfortunate for Ellia, the mountains propensity for cruelty allowed Rhaella to live and escape.

Tywin rightfully knew that an effortless sacking of an otherwise defenseless city would look good in the eyes of Robert & Ned who were still terribly bitter at the deaths of their kin at the hands of the mad king.
TLTR all the other answers, so my apologies if this is treading on already covered ground. 

But from my perspective, Tywin is first and foremost a family man. Not in that he loves his family, but that he cares about power and majesty of the Lannister name. I don't think Tywin wanted to be on the losing side of anything. He took Aerys abuses and humiliations for years, because it was the best way for the Lannister to maintain their power. It's why he wanted to marry Cersei to Rhaegar. But that didn't happen, of course. When Robert and Ned started their rebellion, Tywin didn't join because he knew that whatever side won, he wanted to be on it. So when he saw Aerys' defeat was inevitable, he made his move and sacked King's Landing, knowing that Pycell would let him in. And to ensure his family wouldn't be punished for their tardiness, Tywin ordered the death of Rhaegar's children at the hand of the Mountain Who Rides. He did something he knew Robert wouldn't have the stomach for but would know it was needed to be done. In one fell swoop he made himself an invaluable asset to the new king, and positioned himself so that he could make his daughter queen and ensure the Lannisters would be the second half of a new dynasty. 
Your third assumption is what is a little misplaced.
It has been stated on multiple occasions that once the royal army lost and Rhaegar died at the Battle of the Trident; Tywin knew which way the political winds were blowing and didn't want to be shut out of power. 
George RR Martin designed warfare in Westeros to 'mostly' resemble medieval tactics. In a capital city as large and well defended as King's Landing, a siege could take months to years; that is why Tywin originally presented himself outside the city gates as a friendly relief force. And it took Grand Maester Pycelle's advice (against Varys' pleading) to convince Aerys to open the gates to the Lannister Army. 
Even the sacking of the city was not so immediate that there was time enough for Aerys to plot with his pyromancer to burn the city to ground.

TL:DR Tywin in fact did it to gain favor with Robert the new power in the 7 Kingdoms.
He did it to earn Robert's trust. He refused to assist Robert in the rebellion because it was unclear how the war would turn out. When it became ever so clear that Robert was going to win, he thought that it would be best to earn his trust and say "Hey! I'm on your side!" by sacking King's Landing and killing the royal family
He had the best opportunity at the turning point in the war to show his allegiance by letting Pycelle open the gates to King's Landing.  It didn't take much more than that (and the killing of any remaining Targaryens/Martells) to win Bobby B's favor.  Tywin Lannister and his armies didn't have to lift a finger or lose a single life in order to place themselves in high esteem with the new King of Westeros.
I believe this is actually explained in the book but I can't for the life of me remember where. Basically, Robert was known as an honorable knight. Tywin knew that he would want the Targaryan children dead, but it was unlikely he would do it himself, especially with Eddard there. Tywin already had his ruthless reputation, and when he presented the heads of Elia and her children to Robert, he didn't smile, but he didn't chastise Tywin either. It was something that needed to be done that Robert couldn't do. And a massive favor, since living Targaryans always cause problems.
He was a deal maker.  Him turning removed doubt how the war was going to end, that was huge.  All Robert had to do was to agree to make Cercei the queen.
What I don't think anybody has really touched on yet:
Tywin HATED Aerys.

The books really go into great detail showing the lengths that Aerys went to in slighting and belittling the man who had once been a close friend. Tywin was his Hand and maintained the realm for him, yet Aerys would regularly insult him in front of the court, berate him in front of the small council, undercut his policies in front of common merchants, disregard his advice to diasastrous results, then blame Tywin for those results, GROPED HIS WIFE ON THEIR WEDDING NIGHT, insulted his wife and children in front of the whole court... you get the idea. When Aerys named Jaime to the Kingsguard and removed him as Tywin's golden heir to Casterly Rock, it was really the final straw.

So yes, the sack of King's Landing had political implications, but let's not forget that Tywin was probably taking a lot of personal satisfaction knowing that Aerys was probably pissing himself on the Iron Throne as his city burned around him. It was 20 years of degradation, shit and insults bearing the sweet fruit of revenge.
He did it because Aerys banged his wife and produced Tyrion.
He did it as a power move, which is very much in his general character. Yes he could have supported Robert in other ways, however this was the best way to make a big statement. Everyone knows that Tywin sacked King's Landing; something of that sociopolitical magnitude not only sent a message, but it almost checkmated Robert into offering some sort of gratitude because that's what was expected of a King (let's not get into what manipulating could have gone on in the background with the council to allow this to happen). Twin proposed his daughter Cersei and of course Robert is going to take someone who was known as one of the most beautiful women in the kingdom.

Tywin saw an opportunity to gain some power so he gambled, and he won big.
You need to read A World of Ice and fire to know the details.  On top of my head :


Aerys and Tywin were best friends and mates up until Aerys started getting jealous of Tywin. Those who hated the Lannister started poisoning the Kings ears against him. It was said that the King sat on the throne but it was Tywin who ruled, which further infuriated Aerys. 


In the end apparently Aerys had a go at Joanna, Tywins cousin/love of his life,  just to spite him. 
That ended up with their already failing relationship to go south quickly. Tywin moved out of Kings Landing with Joanna (now his wife) soon after. And had nothing but hatred for the King.  Things calmed down later on and Jamie became a part of the Kingsguard. But that feeling of hate didn't really go away.


Tywin hated Kings landing and The people there who had conspired against him. With the rebellion, he got his chance to wreck it. Not that he might have explicitly ordered it. But everything was put in place for it to happen and he turned a blind eye while it took place. 
He did it to burn bridges, get it?

He was known for being hand of the king to Aerys Targaryen.  He couldn't make it look like he was a Targaryen loyalist when Aerys lost his throne.  He had to send a message to everyone that he was NOT loyal to the Targaryens.

I think you're forgetting the tactical importance of Tywin's move. Without Tywin doing this, Robert's forces would have had to siege KL. As we see with the Battle of the Blackwater, that isn't easy. Tywin didn't just kill off a bunch of Targs, he handed the city to Robert on a silver platter.

As for the sacking, we can't really speak to Tywin's motives. What we can say is that sacking is what tends to happen when an army takes a city. Cersei and Tyrion say as much during Blackwater. Jorah also says as much when convincing Danny to get some Unsullied, who don't have many of the same urges as uncut men.
He need to own the city by the time Robert arrived. It wasn't just to do Robert a favor, it was to physically hold the capitol so that Robert's forces only enter King's Landing peacefully because Tywin allows them to. If gives Tywin a bargaining chip. 


I think the biggest reason is because Robert's alliance didn't really have a lot of wealth (or daughters to marry Robert). The Tully's had daughters who were already married, the Starks had Lyanna, Arryn had no daughters. By sacking the city, it meant Robert would need money to fix it and that was something he could provide, and in return, his daughter would become queen, as he had always wanted. The other more rich 'kingdoms' had sided with the Targs, so Tywin showed himself to be more loyal to Robert's cause and thus likely the only one he would be willing to borrow from.

Also the Targs could only be killed once, once its done nobody else could get credit. Robert had to acknowledge this even if its something he was going to do himself. It also meant Robert could keep his hands clean of having to kill any children or ordering any of them dead. Obviously its something Ned would not have wanted to do, but I'm not sure Tywin knew that at the time.
I think Tywin left many years before the rebellion. A theory I believe is because Aerys raped his wife. Ser Bariston mentions to Danerys that Lady Joanna was the only woman that Aerys really ever showed a liking for and thusly Tyrion is a Targ. Of course, Tywin couldn't admit this for honor sake and couldn't really destroy the Targs on his own. Tywin only fights when he knows he'll win. 

Edit: also Tywin want Cersei to marry Rheagar, but she was rejected by Aerys. He helped Robert when he knew he could win and to put Cersei on the throne like he always wanted. 
Tywin was waiting to see who was winning. He enjoys being on the winning side. Kings landing was getting sacked no matter what. But if it didn't and the tide began to turn for Robert, Tywin would step in for the winning side (the mad king) and help him
He did it to get cersei married to robert, what with Jamie being unable to keep the throne
In addition to the other reasons given, I can think of couple more:

1.  A show of strength to Robert, to prove that even though Tywin was willing to cooperate and acknoweldge Robert as King, he's still not a man to be taken lightly.  

2.  Because with Robert the clear victor in the war, Tywin may have wanted to bring a swift end to the war, and preferred gaining access to Aerys via open gates to the prolonged siege of the capital that Robert and Ned would have had to resort to.
As much as I hate that arrogant rich old prick, Tywin Lannister was the Hand for years because like his son Tyrion he has wit. As well as a fierce knowledge of warfare. Also that amazing ability to always pick the winning side. Tywin knew, Rhaegar was killed by Robert. The Mad King was moments away from becoming a corpse. He used his leverage of loyal service to Aerys to gain his trust to allow the Lannisters through the gates of Kings Landing. Hell if Robert hadn't been injured on The Trident then the result might've been very similar.
Tywin himself basically explained this. He said they came late to Roberts cause and had to show their commitment. More specifically, he was talking about murdering Rhaegars kids during the sack. He knew Robert wouldnt have it in him to do the deed (and Ned never would) but that Robert was relieved when presented with the bodies as it helped secure his throne.



Also, OP or anyone else, any particular GOT podcasts recommended? 
Tywin was Aeries II's hand from 262 AC until 281AC and Tyrion was born during that time, in 273AC. Tywin remained as his hand for a full 8+ years following Tyrion's birth. 
If Aeries II was in fact the (or a) father to Tyrion, that was still not enough shit for Tywin to take. Something else had to do it.
My personal theory is that Rhaegar or another person told Tywin about the PTWP prophecy, and whatever Rhaegar's plans were for the tourny at Harrenhal (Possibly to become King himself or to find a new Northern bride). Whatever Rhaegar's plan, I believe Tywin sided with him to help the prophecy take form.
Then once Raeghar fell on the Trident, Tywin thought it best to get with the winning team, so he sacked the city.
It's also possible he knew of Jon in some regard, and helped keep him secret. Possibly killing Jon's half brother and sister to distract the new King Robert.
Other than dates and watching way too many YouTube videos, I don't have a good source for this and I'm too lazy to find passages in the book right now!

Edit** as it turns out i forgot about Jamie! i still believe he knew about the PTWP, but Jamie being put to the kings guard is why he Tywin left kings landing.
he needed to demonstrate an absolute enthusiasim for robert's cause 

because he was late in joining the war he needed a show of force so robert would not doubt his resolve 


I feel Tywin sacked the city as a warning to Robert.  "Look what I did here, I took the city once and I can do it again, keep me happy."
I'm kinda late to the party, but I'd like to add that tywin probably had quite a lot of physical wealth stored up in kings landing and would desire to recover it with his own army.
>I reject the notion that his army did it on their own accord. That would be wildly undisciplined and Tywin would not tolerate that in his forces.

You mean forces like the Brave Companions or the Mountains men?

Either way sacking a city was kinda what armies did to cities, as in soldiers marched to war under the assumption that sacking would be occurring.  Doesnt Jorah pritty much say "All armies sack"
I believe Tywin was always good at analyzing the situation whether it be the seven kingdoms or the battlefield. In this case, he knew Robert was going to win after the Batte of the Trident, and he did sacked the undefended King's Landing to emphasize that he would come out of this conflict on the winning side.
What are these podcasts you speak of? Been looking for a good GoT podcast. 
Late to the party but thought I'd add to point 3) above: it's a sad fact of war that, throughout history, armies plunder and loot and rape at will, right up to present day conflicts.  Even the most disciplined fighting forces can give in to excesses when taking a town or city, and I think G.R.R. Martin wanted to reflect this: even a figure like Tywin Lannister is just one man, holding an army together only by his personal authority and his officers.  If they all decide, at once, to indulge their baser instincts there's really not much he or his leaders can do except let the rape and murder run it's course.  Modern Military Police exist to curb these acts and maintain discipline; in a feudal army of mostly levies raised as circumstances dictate, oaths of loyalty and threats from your superiors would be a poor substitute.

See the below quote from Captain Robert Blakeney regarding the sacking of Badajoz in the Peninsular war:

*The infuriated soldiery resembled rather a pack of hell hounds vomited up from infernal regions for the extirpation of mankind than what they were but twelve short hours previously – a well-organised, brave, disciplined and obedient British Army, and burning only with impatience for what is called glory.*

For other more recent and equally depressing instances of reprisals you really don't have to look that far - UN Peacekeepers committing atrocities in refugee camps, Soviet soldiers committing atrocities in WWII, ISIS in Sinjar: it's one of the reasons why we do our best to keep soldiers and civilians separated.

GRRM goes out of his way to emphasise this elsewhere in the novels too - the leaders of the great houses may go to war for good or noble reasons, be it refusing to give up their wards (Robert Arryn) or avenging their kin (Ned Stark & later Robb), but their bannermen are simple and poor conscripts, with both sides more than capable of war crimes.  He even has Septon Meribald describe what it's like to fight and be terrified and commit such acts in his 'broken man' speech.

So when Tywin takes King's Landing he has his men enter the city and turn on the city guards, unleashing a tide of disorder and reprisals as the troops run amok.  It could be deliberate policy (convincing arguments listed elsewhere) or it could be the mere fact that an army - especially a feudal one GRRM is portraying - is at best a ragged mob, and when thousands of men decide to go wild there's really nothing you can do about it.  And if you're Tywin and you know you've got to seize control of the city and you know that once you do there will be a sack: even if you tried to stop it happening, would you afterwards say "I lost control of my men?"
He saved the Rebels from having to siege the capital too remember, he got in because Pycelle told the king to trust the Lannisters, not having to siege saved a lot of time and lives.
I see three main reasons,  it certainly helped looking at least not totally responsible for the killing of the Targ children, and it weakened the city of the future King,  which is always good.  Finally I think the first reason isnjust that this was the normal way of thinking for him : Does this city has gold to sack yes/~no~  
If yes,  am I going to take that city for myself and gain a lot more gold by keeping it happy and productive ~~yes~~/no.  
Just a sime calcul. 
>Sacking a (mostly) undefended city was not necessarily going to buy him the love of Robert. 

except it did. That's why he did it. 

Remember, Robert was known for turning his enemies into allies. Obvious Tywin would know this, and used the sack of King's landing as a way to pledge fealty. 
What Got podcasts??? 
Tywin took his revenge on Aerys for not marrying Cersei to Rhaegar and stealing Jaime. He used that opportunity to wipe out the Targaryens to make way for Robert to take the throne and marry Cersei. That's what I think...he did it solely for revenge but called it for Robert. 

Something I find crazy is that Cersei was dissed by both men (Rhaegar and Robert) for Lyanna Stark.  Damn that's gotta give a girl a complex!!
Tywin's actions were made to prove his allegiance to the new monarchy (to the realm at large), but the sack of King's Landing was a motivational move, for his soldiers?
...because he's a character in a fictional story and the dude who wrote him thought it would demonstrate his cruel, calculating nature?
You havent read any of the books have you? A lot of this is covered pretty well in the books. 
Well for one, Robert was winning the rebellion and Tywin wanted to be on the winning side. Second would be Aerys was a crazy person who was burning all those around him, who frequently embarrassed Tywin and even accused him of being a traitor. 

There is also the theory that Tyrion is also Targaryen, being born of his wife and Aerys which could be another reason he was spiteful.

Either way he was the hand of the king that Robert was actively trying to overthrow, if Robert won and he had not done what he did, he was a dead man.
Tywin sacked Kings Landing to reward his soldiers.  It takes A LOT to raise soldiers in your land even if you are the liege lord and paramount.  These soldiers are part of other minor houses and these soldiers all report to their houses lord.  These lords reports to other lords.  And these other lords report to the liege lord.  There is quite a distance between these soldiers and Tywin Lannister.  Usually when armies are raised and marched forward to war whether to fight a battle or to conquer a town, there has to be a reward for these soldiers who are risking their lives.  That reward was the sack of Kings Landing.  You have to reward your troops or else they might not follow you into battle in the future.  If you were a soldier in the Western lands and your liege lord summoned you to war along with thousands of others during that time, where do you think you're going?  Every solider thought they were going to meet the rebels on the field who had just beaten the royal army and has beaten army after army before that.  That's terrifying to think about.  Would you actually go?

You have to reward your soldiers,  and the sack of Kings Landing was an outstanding reward.  That reward carries heavy weight in word-of-mouth for future generations in case Tywin wants to raise an army in the future.
I was gonna reply tongue-in-cheek that most didn't last through the last 20~ winter, but I realized there are probably numerous fans that actually died or will die before even knowing how it ends...

 Daynegasm
That was amazing
the sword of the MOURNING. heheh
what's interesting is that even if we support her claim, the targaryen house will die with her. she can't bear children. 
I bow to no Southerner's king. The only king i will support is one beyond the wall
Because you think some pointy throne in the sweet warm south matters? 
Do you think it matters what person happens to sit the blasted throne when the wights come with ice spiders and all manner of dark creatures who will feast on the living decide it's time? 

Dany is just as ignorant and distant as the lot of them. Her petty squabble with the southern lords will be the end of Westeros. 

Besides, does a dragon make someone a leader? Does a dragon give one sense and wisdom and bravery? Does a dragon give one honor and justice? No.. a dragon gives one power, and no man or woman with power without check is to be trusted. The very thing that gives her a claim is the thing I mistrust most.

I like Jon Snow, because the power he has doesn't come from a mythical force, or some predestined force from on high. He rules because he must, because there are no other options except anarchy and death. He has only as much power as others bestow, no more no less. He doesn't need vast armies to command loyalty, or flowery titles to feel important. 

You keep yer' dragon queen and yer Unsullied, and yer blasted drothraki horde... I'll look to the one who knows what the real danger is. (said in the style of a northen lord)
stannis is the last reliable leader left in westeros. he has the birthright, he's in his prime,he's a tried and tested battle commander and he doesn't just talk about paying people back he does it.
uhhhhhhh because Stannis duh
Targaryens are no longer the ruling family. They no longer have a claim in the eyes of most. Even if they did, both Aegon and John come before her in the line of succession. There are also many houses that would despise targaryen rule. When Aerys killed Brandon they also murdered other sons of noble houses. Everyone north of the trident ain't exactly a fan. 
 I think Dany would be a terrible leader of westeros. She could barely rule Mereen and would be entirely dependent on Tyrion.
I don't support it because i don't think she would be a good ruler she couldn't control Mereen how could she control Westeros

Because I support the one true king, STANNIS THE MANNIS!
Because my king is the KING OF THE NORTH
She can have the South all she wants. Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark.
Because she's a self-entitled little girl with a long family history of cruelty and madness, she's surrounded herself with morally corrupt individuals and outside of the times she's been able to strong arm people with her dragons she's mostly just lucked her way from one endeavour to the next showing no real capacity to use her advisors well.

Simply because Danaerys' claim is false. Now the claim goes to any living Baratheon or even Gendry for that matter. Gendry won't have a direct claim. But he is a choice. Danaerys feels self entitled to the throne where the throne was clear cut won by right of conquest and not by any treachery or wrongdoings. Thinks herself of a queen to the place she hasn't even seen. To quote Tywin "Anyone who says himself as a King is no true King." But all the claim aside. Danaerys fares as a poor ruler who I doubt can handle the current position of Westeros. Even Aegon is better option for Westeros than her. Westeros will have King at the end. But not due to any claim or power or dragons. Chose by the people themselves for leading them through the long night. 
Because Jon has the superior claim. 

And because she has no claim. Roberts Rebellion won. She is technically an exile, not royalty. 
Because monarchies are inherently immoral. I'm holding out for a representative democracy. Tyrion for President!
Because Targaryens are the original usurpers, and because dragons are fucking boring.
http://youtu.be/j9Y3GhpqFoo
from what i have seen i'm guesting it's jealousy, story pretty much over and most likely she is winning this game not their favs, so can't satisfy every fan , 
I support Dany.

It has absolutely nothing to do with her claim. Because, she's quite far in line post-Bobby. 

The only claim to rule in feudal societies is through power. Yes, there's a rule system that's supposed to negate that, but it doesn't work.

I support her because she's a good human being (for now) with the power to gain & maintain control of Westeros. 

I would like to think that enough shit has gone on in Sansa's life since she left that she might see that her time with Tyrion really wasn't that bad all things considered and perhaps a sort of truce  could form between them, but who knows. She may bear a grudge still and seek vengeance with the weight of the North at her back now, giving her the power that she didn't have back in King's Landing.
I'd kind of like them to continue with things.  But either way, Tyrion has a great reputation with all the surviving Starks.  Jon parted as friends (his words) with Tyrion at the Wall, Sansa at times has defended how well Tyrion treated her in a marriage neither wanted, and Tyrion made that saddle for Bran.  I think those things were a set up for Tyrion to enable the Targaryen alliance with the North.  They trust him and know he's a good person at heart.  But I've been shipping Sansa and Tyrion for a while. 
In the books and show to somewhat.Sansa was very materialistic and looks orientated.She believes the handsome knight must be good etc.Were as Tyrion is the opposite the twisted little man who is supposed to embody everything that is bad and wrong.

Obviously thats not the case,Joffrey who is supposed to be handsome is that opposite of what she believes he should be.And since she left the North,Tyrion is the only person who didnt have an alternative motive regarding her,and wants to try to make her happy.

I kind of hope that her character has moved beyond being a naive girl and she can recognise the deeper things that truly matter,and perhaps her Tyrion reunite and resume there marriage.And she will acknowledge he was one who protected her and shielded her somewhat simply because it was the right thing to do
Considering that Sansa defends Tyrion from both Lysa and Ramsay implies that she bears him no ill will. Also, the show made their relationship much more amiable and friendly than the book so I definitely think that she would be open to hearing what Tyrion has to say. 
I think if Dany isn't going to hold a grudge against Tyrion, Sansa won't either.  Lannisters killed both their fathers, and that's all Dany knew and she didn't execute Tyrion for revenge.  Sansa had it worse because her father was killed and she was tormented/kept as a hostage, but she spent time with Tyrion who treated her kindly.  Both Sansa and Dany should see that Tyrion wants to take down Cersei as badly as the rest.  When it comes to Jamie we'll probably see a conflict arise between them, I expect Tyrion will want him spared.
>Do you think they can commiserate in the belief that neither wanted to be forced together.    
     
You spelled consummate wrong.


Tyrion was always very kind to Sansa. She isn't batshit crazy, so I think they may share a shake of the heads and be able to speak to each other on a very unique level. Perhaps even  drinking companions on the long dark nights to come sharing "my life got this shitty" stories.

Considering all that went down  after Ned's death,  the only person to treat Sansa well was Tyrion. Even Littlefinger wanted to manipulate her even when he got her away after the purple wedding. He treated her with respect and defended her when Joffrey was cruel to her. 
Sansa's entire arc is learning that life isn't a "song" and that there are things that matter more than looks.  She might end up with Tyrion because she learns that kindness and intelligence are more important than the superficial things she used to care about.
After what Ramsay put her through, I don't think she's going to really give Tyrion a hard time about it no. She knows that he tried to do right by her in the situation they were both forced into. 
Tyrion was good to Sansa all along. Even before they were wed. Sansa fleeing the city after Joffrey's murder only helped Cersei's allegations that Tyrion was the murderer. So a part of me think Tyrion will still be a little upset about that but he'll understand her motives. I don't think there'll be any animosity on either side.
If they reunite I highly think Sansa will show respect towards Tyrion and can commiserate in he belief that neither wanted to forced together.  Remeber Tyrion treated Sansa very nicely.  He firstly didn't agree with the marriage, trying all his bets to rearrange it with his father.  He mentioned to his father that Sansa would be heartbroken to marry him and really distraught., Tyrion understanded what Sansa had been through.  On the night of the wedding Tyrion proposed no bedding ceremony for Sansa's sake and did not force Sansa to have sex with him. He gave her comfort and space to Let her get used to her new marriage.  He also says in the book all he wanted as for Sansa so be happy with him, to make her laugh and be more comfortable around him.  So with all the respect Tyrion had given to Sansa I highly doubt Sansa will have a grudge for Tyrion after what she experienced with Ramsay botlon
Find out next time on: Game. Of. Thrones!

I have a Lannister banner, my room is red/gold, I have several pieces of lion art and I love Tyrion (who doesn't?) and even Jaime so I figured it was perfect :)
A man needs to know where he can purchase this.
Imagine what he would have been!
So basically Khal Drogo wearing a powdered wig?

I would die in battle for this man.
So basically you created Geralt of Rivia. Loved that game!
I don't think that the son takes the mother surname in dothraki culture
[removed]
The scene with baby Rhaego had me in tears, so emotional man...!! 

Didn't he have black hair when we saw him during the house of the undying visions?
He would have been beautiful. He would of made Westeros great again.
You mean Geralt of Rheago Targaryen
Thought that was Kratos for a moment, nice work!
Holy fuck that is fucking awesome!!
His name made me realize something, I've read all the books (and it may well be in there but I forgot it) and have no idea how names work with the Dothraki, did Drogo have a last name? What would the last name of Drogo's son be?
This reminds me of a really buff Geralt of Rivia from the Witcher series.
The flying, flaming horse
The Stallion who will mount the world. 
Make Westeros Great Again!
Looks like a trace of kratos
Why does he have no bells in his hair
I need some type of fan writing for this character. For closure.
You mean Khal Rhaego?
Rhaego the Unborn
This is just Drogo with blond hair.
Never knew the Targaryens were PC master race
I came here to upvote Witcher comments! 🎉🎊🎊🎉
he would have fucking owned everyone
This is good, though I think it would fit a bit better if he was more slender.  Still toned, but more like a swimmer's body.  He would be a dexterity guy, not a brute strength guy.
So nice !!
Rhaego Drogo
Some men just want to watch the world burn.
This is great, but didn't he have scales and bat wings?
this is so goddamn badass.
All I could think of:

https://imgur.com/gallery/nQL0p
This could also be Geralt of Rivia and Kratos combined.
SO.
MUCH.
YES.
wow i just got really sad

I've had a lot of fun reading this
Has a certain The Witcher vibe. Looks great. 
rip
Drogo! Your son has returned and he brings with him the destruction of Vaes Dothrak!

It's not the necklace that keeps her young. It helps, but it's more of a symbol of her belief. When she took it off in 6x01, it was representing her losing her belief, revealing her true form.
I don't think the necklace had anything to do with her glamour.  That scene was her literally and figuratively stripping down to nothing as her faith waned. 
I assume that the necklace is not unique. I think there is an enchantment that she can imbue any item with, and she has more than one of these enchanted items laying around. Maybe her hairpin is enchanted. Maybe she shoved an enchantment gem up her ass.  
There's been a couple theories.

The necklace gives her more power but isn't everything. When she's taking a bath she's still confident and able to hold her old form when she's at castle black she's really doubting everything and doesn't even care to try and cover her looks

The liquid she pours into the tub helped keep her looks

Selyse is a true believer so she either always saw the true Mel or saw the younger Mel when everybody else would have seen the older version. 
I suspect the answer is somewhere between "We forgot" and "George didn't tell us before".
Could just be a production error. 
It's her belief that keeps her young. If she takes off the necklace but still believes she can keep in her young form.
I am going to assume it was just a slip up in the writing tbh. Shit happens, just like the seven pointed star behind Aerys.

There's a subtle difference in this version compared to the one where Jaime spoke to Brienne about this in that bath scene. In that version, Jaime said that Ned Stark was the first person to come and see that he killed the mad king. But in this version he says that it was his father's knights that came into the hall. Which one is right?

Do you really think a man coming back from the dead is just overlooked by everyone especially considering he was Lord Commander of the Night's Watch
Few things to note.

1. The Boltons.

The Boltons were a uniting force in the north. People hated the Boltons more then anything else. They feared them, and were all living with knives at their throats. They betrayed robb...killed there fathers and brothers and sons, and then paraded around as if they were rightful rulers because of their betrayal. Jon Snow ended that.

2. The winter

People in the north know that things are changing, and there fathers and forefathers have warned them for generations that when winter comes only the Starks will stand for them. That sort of institutional memory is powerful in a region of people that have traditions that run deep. 

3. The betrayal.

The betrayal of Jon by the nights watch absolved him from any vows he took to them. Like a captain who is betrayed by a mutinous crew, the crew stop being the captains duty as soon as they rise against him. Knowing that he was betrayed would also reinforce point 1. (the Boltons). 

It's simple.  No one gives a shit about the Night's Watch.  That's why they have been forced to recruit criminals in order to just have men.  
The show doesn't dipict time that well I don't think, but I can only imagine word got out about what happened. A man being stabbed to death, especially Lord Commander and Neds son, then being brought back to life, definitely got out.

He was stabbed and seemingly the next day was revived, but if I remember correctly, all of this was before he went to go talk to the lords to join his fight for Winterfell. I am sure the conversation came up, and these Lords knew about it.

It is more convenient to assume they have all heard of his death and rebirth rather than awkwardly trying to incorporate a scene where everybody is being informed of the events. I'm sure there must be a name for this plot device.
This is the first time I'm seeing anything about a wight-hunt involving the brotherhood—got a link to a reference?

Beric never used a flaming sword, only Thoros did, and the fires don't last long.
Dorne!! So cool in the books; love the story of Nymeria's conquest, the liberal views on sexuality, the (almost) equal value of women and bastards, the reputation for Dornish peoples drinking/love-making.
north.

Vale. 


storm lands. 

riverlands.

westerlands.

reach.

iron islands.

crownlands.



and way down here dorne.

House Dayne. I really like the mythic founding of the house, the position of Sword of the Morning, and Dawn - a magical sword of pale milkglass full of stars. I like how they have unusual appearances, like Arthur's pale hair or Ashara's purple eyes, and yet hail from Dorne. 

I also have a feeling that house still has a major role to play in the story - either via flashback, or some machinations in the future. 

A special shout out to House Fossoway of New Barrel - the Green Apples. Raymun Fossoway, the founder, was a brief but brave character that pledged his sword to Ser Duncan the Tall during his Trial of Seven. If it weren't for him the entire story would have likely played out differently, as Duncan would have died, Egg's story would have ended differently, and Rhaegar probably never would have been born.

Iron islands and dorne
Some of my favourite houses like the Mallisters, Brackens and Blackwoods are from the Riverlands. So they are prolly like top 3 kingdoms for me
I've always been a Reach man. I think its my not so secret love of the Tyrells and some of the other minor reach lords that cause me to get super excited whenever I see them in the books. I also like the Riverlands and the Stormlands.
Are we talking about favorite in terms of story, or favorite as in "a place we would want to live?"

Storywise, my favorite is a tie between the Iron Islands and the North. 

As for living, the Reach would be my first choice and Dorne seems pretty chill.
The Rock is my favorite because of the ck2 mod. When I first started playing the mod, I started playing as the Lannisters and I've played as someone in the Rock like 60% of the time since. Idk why it was so at first, but now it's so because I know the Rock and all the Lords and what-not in 7979 the most. I like playing as the Braxes the most. They're in the perfect centerpoint position of the Rock so no one every comes there during wars with other kingdoms and raiders never come there from the sea since it's like 3-4 counties inland. Not only that, but also the Braxes have just enough resources so you can get by with all your schemes and events and what-not and at the same time still have a challenge. I don't really like playing as emperor level character from the start because I like to build up to that with schemes and campaigns. anyhoo, yeah, the Westerlands is my favorite region in GoT even though we've never even seen it.
I would say the Vale, but those sods stayed out of the whole war, so ill go with the Stormlands.
Damn, nice job!
This is really good man, I hope this gets popular!

The ballad of Jorah 👏
lol the video desc "An original song of mine, inspired by a character from Game of Thrones. Jorah Mormont is this perpetually sad dude, always hanging around Daenerys and seeming like a sad puppy dog. Such an inspiring role model for all people!"
I also picked up on the camera focusing on it (they did it with Dawn in the TOJ scene and the sword Meera grabs in the cave too).  My best guess was it was showing his lack of desire to do the "manly" things he was supposed to be learning (we saw he can't swing a sword worth shit).  I don't know anything about bows, but I don't think you're supposed to just drop it like that.  Him dropping it was kind of like "fuck this, let's see if Uncle Petyr brought me a toy."  It also showed a lack of respect to his teacher (can't remember his name) who LF called a traitor and nearly had killed, which added to the suspense of Robin deciding whether or not to give him a second chance.  
Isn't a bowman the sigil of house Tarly? Maybe it has got something to do with it (yeah I know it's unlikely but still).

Jaime in the show is pretty behind where he is in the books. By book 4 he's going through the same moral struggles he is at the end of season 6. He's probably one of the most complicated characters in the series and I don't think even he could tell you if he loves or hates his brother 
I think its more Jamie blaming himself.In the books he stands vigil over tywin on his own.He freed Tyrion,but not only did he free him he told him about the worst moment in his life.

I think if they meet again least in the show they may come to a understanding and possibly repair there relationship somewhat.I dont see that happening in the books though.

She knows he has king's blood. But given her interest in Robert's bastards, and especially in Mance, her criteria for kingship are flexible, which means there's ambiguity in how we can interpret her knowledge about Jon—she may know he has Targaryen blood, or she may just think it's because he's descended from Stark kings.
Probably not. 
Honestly I think Melisandre is a bit of an idiot.  Despite getting great attention, if you were to put her in a power ranking with the other red priests and priestesses, I sorta wonder where she would rank.

edit: Idiot may be a bit harsh, but I think she forces truths in her fire visions.  She's also like 400 years old so maybe she's just through with her patience and is ready for things to fall in place.
It's unlikely, but I wouldn't completely rule it out. The two priestesses we've seen seem to know way more than they should
The way she moves on him at Castle Black gives you the direct idea that she knows he's got king's blood.  She pulls her boobs out and crawls on top of him, like with Stannis and like with Gendry.  But they don't really follow it up at all other than him becoming the Prince that Was Promised in her eyes after his resurrection.  
I say yes.  I've commented before that the prospect of the hottest Prince in Westeros getting the kidnapped Stark girl pregnant and no one finding out about it is pretty much impossible.  Then, add the girl's brother coming home with a bastard boy all of a sudden and there are bound to be people who suspect/know.  I think Varys and Littlefinger know.  I think Melisandre heard rumors and now knows...along with many other red witches. 
Well, he was a Prince. His brother-cousin was the King in the North (KINGINDANORF). 

And now he is.

She probably doesn't know for sure but thanks to the resurrection, she believes he must have Targ blood.
beautiful art style. got any more of that?
The Hound loves him some little birds
I absolutely love the "little bird" reference! This is such a subtle part of the story in the books and it brings so much character to both Sandor and Sansa! 
Ugh. Never thought I'd hate even a cartoon version of Joffrey.

I love the style, but feel like Joffrey should be saying something too.  Like an angry storm cloud or something, to counter the Hound's lovely thoughts.

Should have made the birds chickens :)
In general, the story arc for the Hound seems to be a classic "redemption" tale. I think Brother Ray's killing is meant to show another challenge to Sandor's better instincts. Ray's words will end up being more important than his murder in shaping Sandor, though.
I think it's meant to reinforce Sandor's true brutal nature. He meets, in essence, his polar opposite and then is immediately shown how ineffective being a pacifist works out in this world. Westeros is not meant for the faint hearted, Clegane now has hatred filled up back in his heart. He wasn't changed necessarily after his near death experience, but if there was any doubt on forging a new path of peace, it has now all been lost.
On the contrary, I think the writing was excellent.  The Hound ran away from a good chunk of his identity and was then beaten by a woman in combat effectively stripping him of all sense of self.  But he is tough and a survivor.  He stumbles on a group that represent a potential future for him.  They don't share ideals, but they aren't humiliating him or asking him to do dishonorable things constantly either.  Danger comes and kills this group and also kills this new path for the Hound.  On the other hand, it does give the Hound a new purpose - Justice and he seeks that in the only way he knows how.

The Hound is evolving and the interaction with Brother Ray's group shows that he's going from a selfish character to one who seeks justice for others.  In fact, it seems as though he's picking up some traits from Brienne.
In addition to his role in furthering the Hound's story, he can be seen as a foil for the High Sparrow. Brother Ray said that he didn't truly know the gods because no man could. He said that you could never truly know the will of the gods and you just had to do the best you can in living your life. The High Sparrow, on the other hand, speaks of the gods in an almost arrogant way. He claims to know the gods and what their will is. He dares to speak for the gods as if he knows them personally. 

Brother Ray is a good humble man. The High Sparrow is an arrogant man who seeks to be seen as humble while at the same time claiming that he knows the way and that everyone must follow him. 
I think that without Ray's words, if the Hound was guided to the Brotherhood by other means, he would have been disinterested unlike how it turned out in the show
"The world was built by killers. So you’d better get used to looking at them"
I think it was just to shine another little-- longer this time & with dialogue-- light on The Hound's good side. He's a big softy just kind of hardened by his life's circumstances, forced into this ruthless killing machine. It's all he's ever been good at, in his own words, but does he really enjoy it? 

Having a character who didn't know him as The Hound (or at least didn't fear him due to his spiritual beliefs) opened up conversations in a bare & frank tone we're not used to seeing from Clegane. Those moments before (saving Sansa-- twice, fleeting glimpses with Arya, his recoil at the flames during Blackwater Bay, etc) didn't offer much more than implications, and brief ones at that. I'm sure it was also to further his storyline & solidify or give new conviction to his character, obviously. That's just how I interpreted the plot point.

Also, it's been a long time since I saw that episode arc & it's very late at night so hopefully I made some sense. Be kind.
In the show, Brother Ray is meant to represent a couple of things.  First, he described how violent he was in the past and how he had detached more from his emotions to become an unfeeling tool of oppression.  He murdered, stole, raped and burned all in the name of some authority that he really had no connection to other than being born in a particular place.

Second, Brother Ray shows that a human transformation is possible even from the monster that he had become.  They are very explicit about his attitude towards violence now and that he will never use it to confront any problem.  "You don't cure the disease of violence with more violence".  Something like that anyway.

The Hound was very much like Brother Ray when he was working for the Lannisters.  He was a good soldier that did the bidding of his masters no matter the violence involved.  He served them and used that station to get payback on the world for how he had been trteated since he was a child.  They always kept just a touch of his humanity for us to see though like how he helped Sansa on a couple of occasions.

The Hound loses his fight with Brienne and almost dies.  He is taken in by folks that, while a little afraid, do not judge him for his past deeds.  He is forgiven by this group.  He grows to love the community and they begin to feel like a family to him.  

When Sandor discovers that his new family has been murdered by the BWB he takes action.  Why does he take action when it would appear that all of the teaching of Brother Ray are against it?  I'll tell you why.  

Brother Ray, with his death, was an example to Sandor that those who will not fight evil are doomed to suffer at the hands of evil men.  Doing nothing is as bad and as dangerous as being the perpetrators of evil.  For evil to grow, all it takes if for good men to do nothing.

Sandor, decides to do something because he is a fundamentally changed man.  He is no longer the unfeeling obedient dog and he can never be one that shies away from fighting for what is right.  He therefore does not just go out to get revenge but to stop the evil men that caused this harm so they cannot visit it on other people.  Revenge is a bonus but not his true motivation.  

That's how I see it anyway. 
Yeah, the whole 'you can't answer violence with violence' thing he told Clegane seems utterly meaningless when he proceeds to kill 3 guys, especially when 2 of them are random guys Clegane has never seen before. He's still gruff and 'Houndy'

But his arc is simpler in the series, the dumbing down is bound to happen with such complex books. He does seem slightly more sincere, he's obviously upset about the Ray and Co. referring to him as a friend, wanting to avenge them. The Hound pre-Brienne wouldn't have gone about it the same way.
I think Brother Ray is an example of what can become of Sandor if he chose that path and you can see where it lead for Ray. Sandor can be an instrument for good, you see his good intentions from time to time, saving Sansa and Arya, but in the end he can't change what he is... A trained and deadly killer.  I think he knows that and maybe just maybe he can get some redemption for his life and do some good even if that good is killing bad people.
I wish we got a few more episodes with Brother Ray and The Hound together, have The Hound start to build trust in what Brother Ray was saying and maybe start to believe he could leave the violent times behind and then maybe 2 or 3 episodes after then the Brotherhood kill Brother Ray and the people building the sept. I felt for it all to be in one episode was kind of rushed and could of done with been a bit longer.

It also kind of gave a direction/righteousness to Sandors violence 
I see what you mean about the Hound's reintroduction. Sometimes the show can be very consistent, and other times it is so nonsensical it's like watching 'I Love Lucy' backwards.

It was definitely much better than this but in my mind it went like this:

"The hound is dead! hahaha surprise!!! NM he's alive. Haha we totally got you. and OMG GUIZE UR GONNA LUV IT BECAUSE WE GOT ANOTHER GUY FROM A DIFFERENT HBO SHOW AND HIS NAME IS IAN AND HE KICKS ASS (he does, but that's not the point)!!!!!!11!! AND OUR SUPER DUPER CHERRY HBO SPECIAL APPEARANCE GUY DIES! WE KNOW, it's totally shocking, but we didn't have any purpose for this particular character anyway and might as well give another HBO actor a holler. especially a western one, from the world of HBO.

THE HOUND JUST NEEDED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION IN THE WOODS WITH SOMEONE LIKE A NORMAL HUMAN FOR HIS PLOT TO PROGRESS BUT WE ARE WORKING ON WESTWORLD NEXT YEAR AND REMEMBER HOW GREAT DEADWOOD WAS FOR A COUPLE SEASONS? HBO!"

I am 100% sure that it didn't go anything like that but you can never convince me it didn't. 
He wasn't killed by the BWoB, he was killed by imposters posing as the BWoB. 
Gods I love his character. Easily my favorite. Nice to the Hound getting some love.

They are a faithful adaptation of the first book in the series.
There is a very good side story comic called Dunk and egg. Its based on the side story Dunk and egg from grrm. Its about ser duncan the tall and aegon V targaryen when he was a kid. Im not exactly sure but i think its roughly around 100 years before the events of the main series

Sam is on a singular mission, which is to help Jon defend the impending doom from north of the wall, by becoming a Maestor.

 His primary goal is to discover why and how exactly was it that Long Claw, the Valyrian steel sword that killed the white walker and how to make Valyrian tech again. Which he will. Without doubt.

 He is the real hero here. I just hope they have the dewey decimal system in that massive fucking library.
My theory on Valerian steel is that dragon fire was used to originally heat the steel when it was folded and that dragon fire is mucho bad for white walkers.

AFAIK, all the Valyrian Steel swords were made in Valyria, and Bran has no access there.
I don't remember the source, but I vaguely remember GRRM saying somewhere that Valyrian steel making involved dragon fire; if so, they'd need to get Dany's help too...
I was only 1 when it came out, but it's been theorized since the first book and there are several clues given through Ned's dialogue and actions that reveal it. The story about Lyanna Stark's last words being "Promise me Ned" was one of the biggest hints from the get go. Combine that with how honorable Ned is in everything he does and it was already suspect that he would cheat on his wife. Plus, acting so adamantly against Robert wanting to assassinate Dany showed that he had a soft spot for Targaryen children, because he knew what Robert would do if he found out about Jon. Another big clue is Ned telling Cersei that he knew the truth about her children's lineage. It's clear he was hoping Cersei would use the information to flee KL and save her children, which he must have had sympathy for the bastard children even though they are hers.
Are you asking why wouldn't people figure out Jon wasn't Neds son because he named him after a man who basically raised him since he was what 11 and seen as a second father Given the fact that he named his sons after people who were close to him but because Jon arryn wasn't actually his father this should be obvious? 

(Also to make something clear Jon arryn is Neds brother by law, Lysa and Cat are sisters not aunt and niece. Rickon is a common name in the north and appears multiple times in northern family names as does brandon )

Or why wouldn't varys or little finger who never had so much as a single conversation with Ned or Jon up until the events of a Game of thrones figure out that oh hey this kid ain't his?

Why would anyone bother? Ned and His bastard were up north and had no plans nor desire to leave for the capital what use would it be to go hmmm this kid may not be his I mean all we have to go on is this vague naming sense it's not like Jon doesn't have the most Northern features out of all the stark children, or that he looks like Ned the most no let's all raise flags because his name is Jon.
After watching the show I became highly suspicious when Ned was like, "Dude, not right now, because obviously right now is too Tuesday for me and this more of a Wednesday or Thursday type of conversation. But I swear to you that at some other time--because life in Westeros is so safe I am sure I will have the chance in the future to make a special trip to come see you--I will tell you all about your mother."

*narrows eyes*
[Refer to this Stark family lineage](http://i.imgur.com/P9WC9xr.png%5D(according)

Rickon is not a deviation of Rickard's name

There are a few other Stark ancestors with the name "Jon" in them

Also there's this line from the first book

> "Do you recall your history, Bran?" the maester said as they walked. "Tell Osha who they were and what they did, if you can."
He looked at the passing faces and the tales came back to him. The maester had told him the stories, and Old Nan had made them come alive. "That one is Jon Stark. When the sea raiders landed in the east, he drove them out and built the castle at White Harbor. His son was Rickard Stark, not my father's father but another Rickard, he took the Neck away from the Marsh King and married his daughter."

With all of this, I never suspected anything about Jon's name in the first place


Its a long time ago that I read the books now but I recall somewhere in the opening chapters of the first book they talked about Jon's violet eyes.  A trait that neither the Starks or Baratheons had.  The Targaryans did though and the whole them of the first book was about finding out blood lines through traits.  My suspicion's started then.  A few other hints in the books made me sure enough it was true to search the internet for other hints.
It's theorised that Lyanna whispered Jons name to Ned as Jaehearys. But Ned, knowing how Targaryen that sounded, would go on to call him Jon. Ned could have named him through the J connection as both names begin with J 
My only thought was that only Jon and Arya had a very Stark appearance (at least in the books). I thought it was strange that out of all the boys only his bastard would look like a Stark while the rest held the Tully gene more prominent. I had no idea what it meant but it was an idea.
Pretty much all the evidence either way is in the first book so.... yes.
I think we should have known to question Jon's parentage on the basis of Ned's personality alone. 

Ned Stark was just not the type of man to cheat on his wife- but he WAS the type of man to tarnish his own reputation in order to protect an innocent child.
Depends on whether you mean "was it possible to present a plausible case with only AGOT info" or "Should it have been obvious for a first time unspoiled reader". For the book it was absolutely possible to figure out and some did, though I'm guessing more by bed of blood and "promise me Ned" than anything to do with names. The show S1 has some of the same clues, but not the biggest ones.
The clues were there (even without the luxury of hindsight).  If I remember correctly, Ned found her dying in a bed of blood.  This is often used for childbirth and should have raised suspicion.  So now we have a baby.  Then he comes home with a bastard.  Very convenient, and unlike honorable Ned.  

As for the father, she was "kidnapped and raped" (or went willingly) by Rheagar.  So, Rheagar is likely the baby daddy, and Ned knows this baby is toast.  Leading to his hardship over "promise me".  

So yes, from the books at least, book one should have raised suspicion. Add in clues like the presence of kings guard at the tower of joy and it is practically confirmed.  The name Jon doesn't really need to factor in at all.

I think they keep them with the rest of their belongings, they just don't carry them on their person.  We see Jorah and Daario stash their weapons because they had no where in the city to hide them later.
Law is no open carry. Concealed carry is allowed.
i guess in the same way you get your coat back after a concert. You hand over your sword, get a piece of paper with a symbol on it, and another piece with the same symbol is stuck to your sword, now when you return your piece of paper anyone can retrieve your sword, no biggie.

> How did Stannis get North of the wall exactly when he engaged the Wildlings & Jon?

We last saw him across the narrow sea, in Braavos. That's where he got a loan from the Iron Bank and hired a bunch more troops and ships. He then took the ships directly to the Night's Watch's coastal castle, Eastwatch by the Sea, and marched west towards Castle Black on the north side of the Wall from there.

> Also, why was he North of the wall? Was it to get Mance to join him?

That and to have the tactical advantages of flanking and surprise.

Many reasons. I believe he intended on saving the nights watch, and that he wanted to save the north from the wildlings in order to rally the northerners behind him

Also he sailed around the wall when he left Braavos
It's been a while since I read the books but I believe the red lady saw the battle in the flames so Stannis marched north. 

For Stannis and Melisandre the Iron throne was only part of what they believed Stannis was destined for. Unless I am misremembering, Melisandre thought that Stannis would defeat the white walkers.

He wants to use the wildlings but he needs Mance to bend the knee. Short of that he wanted to name Jon a Stark and give him Winterfell to rally the North behind Stannis

This deserves every praise there possibly is.

The wine was intentionally extra strong, and that was enough for him to lose to the boar.

And Varys theorized that Cersei had backup plans if he ended up not dying to an animal, like a staged drunken fall off a horse or something.
In the books, Ned notes that when Robert hunts boars, he lets them charge him and kills them with a spear at the last possible moment. Robert was pretty good at this, but if he was hit with a far stronger wine than he was expecting, then he would have next to no chance to actually beat the boar.
The wine was described as "strong," probably a fortified wine.  You can add some liquor to wine, it'll boost the alcohol content.  You can get drunk easier / quicker.  

He blames missing the boar on his having been drinking.  Lancel was supplying the wine (and at the time, sleeping with Cercei) so Ned suspected him.  

It's not universal.  Some people say he was just drunk on his own, that he chose to drink.  Some people say that an experienced drinking (and Robert was nothing if not an expert drinker) would notice.  He may have just thought it was good wine or high alcohol wine.  In older times, alcohol content of wines and beers would very depending who made it and how.  Ser Barriston blames himself for not being quicker.

Cercei may have provided the opportunity, but getting him killed is a stretch.  At most, she got him drunk in a dangerous situation.
Wouldn't be surprised if she hit up Pycelle for a sedative, which would have been masked by the strength of the vino. 

It's not explicit... but her pattern of behavior in the time since leaves us with no doubt that she had a hand in his demise.

It's actually quite comical that Cersei gets any credit for his death, good old Bobby B did himself in, let's be real.

"I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him."

Who u foolin bish, we all know ur family's ass got lucky af. Literally like a bartender bragging he 'killed' a drunk driver.
I don't mind this theory.

I will point out that another theory that has Drogon or the dragons being light bringer from the sacrifice of Khal Drogo is out there and Dany did love him.

Jon loved Ygritte and the Nights Watch killed her.  Not his personal arrow killed her but there was some other theory that the Nights Watch is light bringer something to do with their vows being the "I am the sword in the darkness"  "I am the light that brings the dawn"  lines and that metaphorically the Night's Watch is Lightbringer and that Jon sacrificed Ygritte to them.

I agree that the show does put a lot of development into Sam/Gilly so it is curious.
Does the Azor Ahai prophecy say that the second coming of Azor Ahai will mirror the same events as the "first coming"?

I mean, Jesus is supposed to return to Earth at some point, but it won't be as a baby, and it won't be to teach the world shit. It'll be to judge and then destroy us.

Lightbringer has already been forged, so even if Sam were Azor Ahai, he wouldn't need to stab Gilly in the heart to create it. Seems to me that there are only three options with Lightbringer: it's a real sword, like the Sword in the Stone; it's a metaphor (i.e., Dany's dragons, as was mentioned earlier); or, that any sword could be Lightbringer, as long as the Lord of Light's flame is flowing from it.

In any event, all our questions will be answered in the next couple decades or so. Sit tight.
Arya ugly? Oh man
Good theory, but Hot Pie is clearly the prince who was promised. No other character makes sense
Samwell Tarly is George RR Martin, it is known (Dothraki style). 

He is fat and not martially skilled but he still gets one of the few Valyrian swords in the world and somehow manages to survive battles. He is unattractive but he easily gets an attractive girl who starts fucking him out of the blue, doesn't need foreplay and does all the work. George RR Martin doesn't have any children, so in the story Sam is not the biological father of little Sam, he had a son as a bonus. He is a bookworm, a nerd, intelligent like GRRM and the best friend of the main protagonist by pure luck. He fulfilled his dream of becoming a maester in his early 20s, although all other maesters around are 100 years old. Basically, whatever he wishes happens and he miraculously survives and becomes happy while all other characters suffer in endless tragedies and die if they get 3 minutes of happiness.

So, I think that's why he had all of those, not because he was set up to be Azor Ahai or something. I don't think GRRM would go that far :)

I've thought about it too and it's definitely possible. However, the emphasis that Hearts Bane is Valyrian steel makes me think that Sam will use the sword at the citadel to figure out how Valyrian steel was forged. With all of the obsidian at Dragonstone Sam can be the solution to arming the people of Westeros against the WW. Plus he's a terrible swordsman and a self-admitting coward, so even if he was Azor Ahai it would be tough for him to stop the WW.

I completely agree with your making the good guys ugly point though. On that same concept, part of me believes that the hound is Azor Ahai. With all the emphasis on how the gods aren't done with him yet, watching him overcome his fear of fire to wield Lightbringer would be pretty sweet.
GRRM has left all of his prophecies so open ended that he could realistically go any direction and make it fit the story. Do I think your theory will come true? No, but I really like these kinds of theories because after it all ends it's like I'll have a bunch of alternate endings in my head. 
I though the focus on Sam was that he:

1. Has a valyrian steel sword that he can give to Jon or inspect to figure out how it kills the WW 

2. So that he can find documentation in the citadel showing Lyanna and Rhaegar were actually married, legitimising Jon as a targaryen and his claim right to the iron throne. (unless you believe the J + A = T / young griff) 
No way Sam is Azor Ahai. I'm sorry but as a character Samwell Tarly does not possess the strength require to plunge a sword into Gilly's heart. I honestly could see him fleeing into hiding, seeking safety from the WW rather than killing her.  
I think what he meant was that he doesn't believe that he is someone others should believe in, including himself. The fact that he drinks so much shows how unsatisfied with the world Tyrion really is, as at the end of the day drinking is a way to cope with the harsh realities of life, doesn't matter what time period you go to for that. As a result of a world that has discriminated against him for as long as he can remember, he has sort of become a nihilist in some ways. This view on life is part of what makes Tyrion so smart in the first place, his organic skepticism towards a lot of things is a perspective that is far beyond the time period of ASOIAF. Despite all of the skepticism, he believes in Dany because she is someone that genuinely has never discriminated against him and gives him a fair chance in life, even though the Lannisters are partially the reason her entire family was slaughtered. His family or the gods never game him that fair chance in his opinion, but she does. When she annoints him as Hand of the Queen, it is the most rewarding moment of Tyrion's life because for the first time he feels like he has earned this achievement and is finally being appreciated for his dedication to governing.
Tyrion from Season 1: “My brother has his sword, King Robert has his warhammer and I have my mind...and a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone if it is to keep its edge. That's why I read so much Jon Snow.”

Tyrion is smart because he reads and studies and is gifted mentally.  He doesn't believe in himself because he has no reason to.  His name is not mentioned in books, the people around him look down on him, and as far as he knows, his talent is "I drink and I know things".  Towards the end of Season 6, Tyrion is finally getting put in a position where he can apply the things he knows and do something that benefits people other than himself AND get credit for it.
Some of the most intelligent people I've met seem to be pretty cynical about humanity, including themselves.

The best people I have ever known in life are people who don't think they are better than anyone else, and know that their opinions and feelings aren't any more valid than anyone else's. They are aware that as strongly as they feel, there is a person with as many reasons to feel the other way. They are able to maintain a perspective outside of themselves and their own culture; they can relate to people who live a completely different type of life, in different circumstances, because wherever they go, everyone, everywhere, at the end of the day--even Justin Bieber--is just another person living ilfe, trying to be happy. 

Tyrion seems like a great example of that--you don't have to think you are right in order to be smart. In fact, a healthy dose of the opposite can make you even smarter. 
Winterfell in particular is built underneath hot springs or something of the sort. Made mention of in AGoT. Otherwise it would be close to uninhabitable in the winter 
http://www.exploring-castles.com/life_in_a_medieval_castle.html

http://blog.english-heritage.org.uk/10-ways-keep-warm-time/

Now im down the rabbit hole of castles and stuff lol
Fires in every room, and they wore tons of clothing, well, the people that could afford it did.  
Winterfell is heated from the (magical) hot springs below the castle. Think of it like a hot coil radiating heat upward through the floors and walls. 
I'm pretty sure they are mostly just cold all the time.

Sansa describes the Eyrie in AFFC as "In winter this will be a cold white prison"

And at Castle Black I remember they have tunnels they used when the snow was 40 ft outside and warming shacks men may huddle in to keep warm.
big fucking dragon underneath ;)

This is amazing lore. Can't wait to watch all the videos from the S6 DVD
Are there more lore videos like this? I could watch these all day :)
I need someone with the knowledge to help me understand this.

Children and first men are fighting. Fight so long, they come to a pact. 

The children and first men team up to fight the white walkers...which the children created by creating the Night King. So when did this happen? Did they turn the first man into the Night King when they were fighting in the beginning or after the pact? They created the Night King to help them with the first men. I need help haha, thanks.
Are the rest of these season 6 history and lore videos up somewhere to watch?

Children of the Forrest (Gump)?
The viewers.
I've said it before...  I think people forget what an absolute beast Khal Drogo was.  I think that with similar armor and similar weaponry, Drogo's combination of raw speed and strength makes him one of the best GOT fighters ever.  
Drogo and its not even close

The only way someone would beat drogo is by having armour and the freefolk dont have armour 
Tormund is a formidable fighter but Khal Drogo would win. Neither of them is a knight and they both fight their ways Widllings and Dothraki. His speed, strength and also technique for a guy of his size. 
Drogo was one of the greatest fighters East of the Narrow Sea. Plus his weapons are better forged than Tormund's would be. Drogo is so fast that he would easily beat Tormund. It'd be over before it even got good.
Drogo, without a doubt. I think he would even make a decent chance against the mountain.
The comments look pretty one sided, but just a question. Doesn't "Giantsbane" mean that Tormund killed a giant once? Could he have more formidable than we know? 
I've said it before but I'll say it again. There should be a Mortal Kombat video game, with just Game of Thrones characters. Khal Drogo would easily be one of the 3-4 best fighters, including the Mountain, Oberyn, and Ser Arthur Dayne.
The Khal of Khals and it wouldn't be close!
Books: Drogo on horse, Tormund on foot

Show: Drogo on horse, Tormund on foot

In the books they're both talented warriors, but Tormund has been killing rangers and undead for years, while Drogo mostly kills civilians and shirtless Dothrraki.  In the show, they're both supposed to be martially skilled I guess, but they look really really stupid on screen doing any fighting - I'll give it to Tormund though, since he at least kills people and he outmatches Alliser Thorne who literally trains people how to fight all day.  Drogo really is only good at killing Dothraki, and cilvians, and the Dothraki he kills, are also only good at killing Dothraki and civilians.  Any wildlings who have seen actual combat are scarier than a Dothraki, by far


Drogo is obviously a superior rider though, if they were charging each other in a cavalry line, I'm sure Drogo's horsemen would come out on top


Everyone is saying Drogo, but idk, I kinda think Tormund. The ONLY glimpse we get of Drogo fighting, he's pretty reckless. Yea, he was *undefeated in battle*, but Tormund is still alive and Drogo isn't. That's nothing to shake a stick at. Tormund has fought [spoilers tv/ASOS](#s "the Others, the Night's Watch, and the Bolton army"), many of whom were indeed more armored than Drogo. Har!
Drogo was the best khal to date 
The greatest swordsman who ever lived didn't have a sword??

Drogo I think but I also think it could be a pretty close fight. Tormund did beat Alliser Thorne in a 1v1 and also Smalljon Umber (though only when Smalljon got destracted). That and 'easily' surviving many dangerous battles is nothing to sneeze at.
Size-wise they're pretty much the same. In regards of armor, Thormunds rags and leather scraps doesn't really do much against a proper weapon like a razor-sharp arahk. So it narrows down to technique, speed and ferocity. Thormund, as far as I've seen, is basing his fighting style on hack and slash and brute force. While their ferocity might be evenly matched, Drogo has won over several khalasars by being the fastest, strongest and best fighter in the Grass Sea. Thormund might hold his own for a few moments, but eventually Drogo will rip him to shreds.
I don't know who would win, but I know who would win between Khal Drogo and a pillow.
I like to think that their fight would last for maybe a minute before they realize how much they have in common and become instant BFFs.
As far I'm concerned, Drogo was the most skilled fighter in GoT.
I think his only problem is the lack of armor.
In 1 x 1 combat the only one who could beat him is Arthur Dayne( and Wun Wun, but focusing on humans)
Drogo vs The Mountain. 
Now I would pay to watch that
Well considering Tormund was almost beat by Smalljon fookin' Umber,

I'm saying Drogo
Khal Drogo makes Tormund look like Rickon Stark
D & D tend to stay true to the source material so I don't think that they will deviate too much from that. If by "a real ending" you mean everything will be tied up nicely in a little bow then no that's not Martin's style. GRRM already has an ending in mind and he told the show runners years ago. 
The main ending will be the same.  Who gets the throne, what happens to the kingdoms, probably the main characters.  

What happens to the minor characters may be different.  The show likes to bring back characters and explain things, or use a character in place of another for the sake of time and clarity.  People may die earlier, or minor characters may have different fates.  If Ser Barriston lives in the show, that's just a minor change, not a different ending.
The ending will be the same .... X is defeated by X and X is on the Iron Throne, X will kill X kind of scenarios that are important.  I imagine whoever kills Cersei in the show will also kill her in the books because that is really relevant to both the book and show storylines.

How some things shake loose, will be different as long as they arrive to the same end.  It already is.  For instance, in the books Sansa is still a virgin and in the Vale and Jeyne Poole pretending to be Arya is being raped by Ramsay Bolton much to the North's dismay.  Sansa will eventually get back to Jon's side with the Knights of the Vale in tow but they way it is now in the books doesn't line up with the show's progression. 
If I had it my way, it would absolutely have a different ending so I can get enjoyment from both tv show and books without being spoiled.

With that said, no, the tv show will almost absolutely have the same general ending.

We know Martin told D & D the ending he has in mind and they are working to adapt Martin's a story to a television format. However, I have a feeling that, while Martin had an ending in mind when he began Winds of Winter, a lot can happen 400,000 words later. Plot develop and change - it's all part of the writing process. 
Depends on how much they can differ and still be called "the same". By some mile/lightyear wide strokes I think they will be the same, but there will be too many deviations for me to say they are the same. Is brother Ray from the show the Elder Brother from AFFC? Is show Euron the same as book Euron? If you say yes to those I think you'll say the ending is the same. I do not.
[did you finish the shading on his upper lip?](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/napoleondynamite/images/2/23/Trisha_Drawing.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120117232137)
I hope to provide some constructive criticism here. I think the positioning on the nose is a tad low and too narrow at the tip/nostrils.
Your eyes and eyebrows are good but the outline on the eyebrows takes away a bit, give them rough edges at the outer ends at least. Same goes for the outlining on the lips. Try just the curves lines leaving their ends to lightly define the lips. You're missing a touch of shading on the right side (his left) cheek.
Overall this is a great start!

Handsome non-dwarf Tyrion? Me likey.
Sorry for being a little nosy, but did you draw it from head?
This is very nice.  Much better than I can do.  I will say that the nose is a little off to me, but the rest is quite good.

Overall, I actually can feel his expression, so bravo.

Pencil and paper media isn't always very forgiving and you made it look very good.
I like the eyes, but the nose looks a little sexy for Tyrion.
You can see it's Tyrion by his (facial) hair, but the face looks a bit generic. Anyways, great job. :) 
I can't do any better myself.
Haha sorry for the messed up nose and hair. I pretty much suck at drawing hair (no patience) and Tyrion nose was difficult to draw without making him Look like a pig xD. 

I'll try to draw simpler characters next time :)
Great job! The nose does look a little off but I can tell that it's Tyrion.
Liam on Noel Gallagher from Oasis?
Looks great to me!
He looks like Tyrion Lannister
Pretty straightforward: Doreah clearly knew of Xaro's plan, didn't say anything, or maybe even helped Xaro plan this whole debacle, and then got caught in bed with him. Game over. 


> did she betray them as well,

Yes.

> if so, how?

She worked with Xaro to take the dragons and kill Irri and the others who were there.
It's not entirely clear.

There's a deleted scene that shows Doreah is the one who killed Irri. Daenerys didn't know that, but as show viewers, we would have known if the scene had been left in.

However the scene was removed, and even if it had been left in, Daenerys didn't learn about it on screen. Plus Daenerys did send Doreah to spy on Xaro previously, ~~so it wasn't weird that she was there with him~~. edit: actually, Daenerys didn't instruct her to sleep with Xaro, she implied she should seduced someone in Xaro's entourage. So it *was* weird Doreah was in bed with Xaro.

I think Daenerys may have assumed that Doreah must have known about Xaro's plans. And despite being a main protagonist, Daenerys isn't 100% right in the head. She tends to overdo it when she's out for blood.

God, this literally screams Tyrion & Jon as advisers to Dany.
I've always wondered which of the two killed the other for food a few days before dying of renal failure.
False, his real name is Moonboy for all we know.
I thought the current theory is Jaehaerys.
I always thought Aemon is likely.

Prince Aemon the Dragonknight also loved his sister Naerys that was married to their brother Aegon the Unworthy....the original draft has an interesting Arya/Jon relationship that pairs nicely with the Aemon/Naerys relationship.

Also the other Aemon Targ - Maester Aemon didn't happen to have that name for no reason.

Its possible! I really like this. 
Based solely on this, Aemon is a likely name. Aemon the Dragonnight was the best swordsman of his time, as Jon is pretty much said to be so in Season 6. Also.... Robb a fool in love, a love that cost him dearly so that Florian the Fool could be another hint too.
Oh my gosh I love these so much I cant wait for the blu-ray!
I'm disappointed that Best Buy stopped doing the custom covers with the house sigils.  I've been collecting them since season 1.
What is this
Pre-order? I just received mine (Europe).
Doesnt it release today?
And then he dies in the worst character death of the entire series. :(
Cant the besieging army also just fish in the river?
Pretty good hype concidering they just yielded the castle and didn't even bother to have a black fish death scene. 
Im mostly hyped for the Histories and Lore that comes with it personally! 
This is amazing. Where do I find more expanded lore videos like it?
Where's Stannis?! We didn't see him die.
#onetrueking
The bluray of this season has some amazing extras! Can't believe there are 13, that's T-H-I-R-T-E-E-N commentaries on this set. The documentaries are amazing as well. God I love this show and almost everything they do.

> We know that Valyrian Steel can kill wights

You mean white walkers? Ordinary fire will do for wights.

https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/wiki/faq#wiki_what_is_the_difference_between_wights.2C_others.2C_and_white_walkers.3F

> Is it possible that someone could lead an expedition into Valryia to try and uncover the secrets of creating the steel so that the war against the dead can actually be won? And not a single person, I mean a large force, thousands strong.

Seems a lot more efficient to send those people to Dragonstone to mine the dragonglass (obsidian) there. Stannis told Sam there was a lot, and we know for sure that it works against white walkers too. Whereas a Valyria expedition could turn up nothing.
1. Valyrian steel kills White Walkers, not wights.

2. Obsidian is just as effective at killing WWs and is much less expensive. It is available is massive quantities at Dragonstone.

3. It seems very unlikely that there would be the secret to VS written down on a wall in Old Valyria. It was a secret that died with the Valyrian Freehold.

4. People have gone to Valyria and never returned. An old king of the rock is one (he actually lost the Lannister ancestral valyrian steel sword, Brightroar) The ruins are said to be cursed and you are unlikely to find many people willing to risk their lives in Valyria. I will admit Euron Greyjoy "claims" to have gone there and gotten a suit of VS armor.

Just seems like a lot of risk without too much reward. Even if the secret to VS was found, the process is still very expensive. They wouldn't have much time to forge new swords before the WWs invade.
I'm becoming convinced that the method for crafting VS is known within the Citadel since they craft rings of it for their chains after they study magic and obviously Sam will find it somehow.  It likely includes mixing in some sort of ground dragon glass powder during the forging of the steel like how carbon is added to strengthen steel in the real world during forging.  This would also explain the smokey coloring and look of VS that is described in the books as well as the extra sharpness of the blades just like obsidian blades are supposed to be sharper than steel irl.  
Like Euron?
Any steel can kill wights, fire is better.  Valaryian steel or dragonglass must be used on White Walkers

Maybe, but the process might not be written down anywhere, it might've been lost with the deaths of Valyria's sorcerors.
Tobho Mott is still much closer though
I thought bran might know the secret to crafting it now, wouldn't he?

I hope someone uploads them all to one place. pretty please
The first glimpse we got of the War for the Dawn was the first scene of Season 1. The Nights Watch rides out to investigate mysterious disappearances and the sortie gets slaughtered, sans Wil, by the White Walkers. The War for the Dawn has been going since that episode and probably before, the southron lords simply didn't know it at the time. Mance and the Wildlings knew it but those south of the Wall didn't know it until Jeor Mormont sent the wights hand to King's Landing--even then it was discounted.

The final two seasons will focus more on the war between the living and the dead. It's the ultimate battle. The battle for life itself and will it come down to one massive battle. I'm afraid from a storytelling perspective that I think it's more probable than improbable that we'll get one massive, decisive battle to end the White Walker threat.

The Night King being the embodiment of death is accurate. That's all he wants. The victory will be stemming the tide of death from overtaking the land and snuffing out all life. Yes, everyone dies but the war is not just to defeat death. It's to keep life and, to a lesser extent, death.
Just my $0.02.
There will be mostly power struggles between the living. Whitewalkers start to progress south,this unifies the living there are some lossy skirmishes and a peace reached. And history is set to repeat itself

That's my guess

How old is your mom?
It's so unclear, but I think most people generally agree (myself included) that they are the same and that its Jon
Seeing as Lyanna literally said "promise me Ned" I think it's safe to say that Jon is the prince that is promised. That could of course be a misdirect but by the looks of the timeline and how long is left in the books/series there isn't any time for any more red herrings.


Last Hero: Bran

Azor Ahai: Jon

Price that was promised/ Stallion to Mount the World: Dany 

Dany is meant to rule, and not just the Dothraki. She is the prince(ss) that was promised and will unite the world under her rule. Jon is AA and will be the one to lead men against the WW and save the world from the 2nd Long Night. Bran is the last hero because he is the only one who can save mankind. His gift allows him access to all of the secrets of history, allowing him to figure out how to stop the WW. He cannot defeat them though, on account of the fact that he doesn't have legs that work. But he will be the one to awaken the Targ side of Jon I think, and will be the driver behind Jon uniting men against the WW. He will also be the main reason for a revitalization of the Night's Watch. 
I respectfully disagree. I think they're all the same person seem by different cultures/beliefs and they all point to Daenerys (She has some "First Man" blood by her great gradmather, Betha Blackwood). Even the show strongly point to Daenerys. They did not create Kinvara (an exclusive character) for nothing. And let's remember they often call this savior "the prince/one that was PROMISED", so if you consider all those times people around the world spoke about Dany (since de first episode) than you have someone who has been promised, literally.

The Last Hero is a legend, not a prophecy. Its the name for a particular, historic person that founded (or helped at founding) the Night's Watch.
Jon snow all the way 

Born under a bleeding star - Arthur Dayne sword and blood 

Blood of the Dragon - Son of Rhaegar Targaryen 

Wake Dragons from stone - Resurrected by the sacrifice of Shireen Baratheon  Jon = Dragon  Shireen = Stone 

Born admits salt and smoke- Reborn/resurrected by the burning of Shireen fire = Smoke  Tears = salt 

literally is a Prince who was promised 

And is the the third and possible only surviving head of the Dragon - Rhaegar = Dragon  Heads = His children 1 Rhaenys dead 2 Aegon dead in tv show maybe alive in books 3 Jon Snow and let's not forget 3 is a very important number it took three attempts to forge Lightbringer 






I missed The Stallion That Will Mount The World.

Pretty much only applies to Dany though...
Isn't her fleet made up of ships that Yara stole from the iron fleet? Seems like she and Theon may have something to say about that. I could see her doing it. But it seems like it would be a big mistake, considering the huge tactical advantage it gives her.
Would be cool af but the Dothraki would need a way back :P
Yeah that's actually quite a cool idea.
I feel like its something she might do. kind of a waste of money, but thats ok, lol
It isnt just her fleet, also Dorne and Highgarden. Not the best way to start off new alliance.

She's probably going to land at Dragonstone, her family's seat and her place of birth. Plus, no one's heard from the place since Stannis left for the north so it makes that much more sense. Considering Dragonstone is an island she's gonna continue to need the ships even after she arrives.
She will need the ships to take on Euron's fleet.
I don't think she'll burn her fleet. She knows that the Iron Born under Euron are preparing a massive fleet that could challenge hers. She needs a strong fleet to protect her ports and shores. She'll need them to secure her outer borders once she conquers Westeros proper.
His character is total opposite of Jon Snow.

"Kill them. And save the bullets"

"All SATO forces are ordered to surrender for immediate execution" lol
Thank God I'm not the only one 
he's only there for like 10 mins. Disappointing!
He did a great job for the scenes he was in. But he was strongly under utilized. 

I rented the game just to see how kit did as a bad guy.

"The war of the ninepenny kings they called it. But I never saw a king, nor earned a penny."

That right there is the quote that made AFFC my favourite book. I know it's not generally regarded as popular among readers; but to me the parts where they showed the effect wars have on the countryside made it for me. It's timeless.

Am not sure if the graphic novels are based of the books or show but I'd (haven't read the either) but you should probably pick up both if you can!
The graphic novels are based on the books, but only the first book is covered, so if you're looking for more material beyond that then you're better off just reading the books :) That said, I really enjoyed reading both. 
Bugger your bloody restrictions. Watch the damn show.
I would pay money for these
You should definitely consider selling these on Etsy!!

Hardhome kid raises so many questions for me. If he's a degraded skeleton, why does he have a full head of hair and lips and ears and a nose?
It took me a minute to find something because I kept searching for "light of seven" or thrones.  Derp.  Go to Etsy and search for, "seven point necklace."  Make sure to buy from an American seller and check if item is already made or you won't get it in time.

I like that you want to be someone atypical.  You know there will be 20 Jons and Danys at that party.  You should bring a big piece of lumber to carry around, like whatever they were building.

Edited to add:  it looks like there are also some under fairy star, heptagram or septagram
Search for "tunic" for the shirt.  Otherwise you could make/buy a bunch of tentacles and go as the Greyjoy kraken.  Funny always wins the contests.

I hope you kinda look like him and/or your party group is super into GOT.  On Halloween I went as blind Arya and maybe 5 people recognized me in a relatively large city.

If you aren't Jon, Drogo, or Dany people need lots of hints.

Good luck!
you could probably make your own necklace if you're artsy and stuff
I wonder how far they'll go back. Maybe starting a bit before the tournament where Rhaegar took Lyanna and lasting until Robert takes the throne?
I would love a storyline about Old Valyria
I wish they could go back in time....start with Roberts war and put in a ton of things they left out. 
Please do Dunk and Egg Please do Dunk and Egg Please do Dunk and Egg Please do Dunk and Egg Please do Dunk and Egg Please do Dunk and Egg Please do Dunk and Egg Please do Dunk and Egg!
A prequel anthology series would be pretty cool. Different seasons to cover different events
My vote goes for the Dance of the Dragons. Epic and dramatic with all the elements that makes GoT so compelling. It also benefits from being a story a lot of casual viewers and non-book readers aren't as familiar with as, say, Robert's Rebellion.
I think I must be one of the minority here that does not want to see Robert's Rebellion. It only matters in the context of the current series, and most of the main and exciting plot points have already been revealed in one way or another. I dislike most "prequels" for the simple reason that they have to tell a story that hits certain notes to match with the rest. I just feel like there is not as much freedom to explore.  I don't have much faith they could tell an all new story though, so maybe it's for the best.
Dunk & Egg!
If they do, I hope they put as much care unto casting as they did for s1. The brilliant casting really makes this show. 
"I'll take as much as we can get"

Well guess that means its definitely shorter than season 7.  Shame considering how much they are just fast forwarding these final seasons...
Dunk and egg or the dance of the dragons would be awesome. I know everyone wants Roberts rebellion but if before something further back. The original long night would be cool.
Aegon's Conquest or Roberts Rebellion. Or even better show us parts of Planetos (I hate that word) that we haven't seen yet and likely won't see. Stuff like Ashai.
Am I the only person on earth who finds prequels annoying? You already know how they turn out. If they did a prequel about Robert's rebellion, I'm not gonna go in thinking, Rheagar's got this! 
HBO... Please. Don't let me down on this one. 
I'm still hoping we get an anthology-type deal dealing with each of the Targaryen kings. There's tons of cool lore.
Pls not Roberts rebellion. I want to explore something farther back. Give us 7 seasons of the blackfyre rebellions. Or the dance of dragons. There is so much to choose from
Great potential there, but I don't know...GRRM's storytelling is amazing, but it's clear when the show diverges from the books how inferior the screenwriters are when they don't have GRRM's story to work from. Poorly thought out plots, 2d characters, etc.
Sir Duncan the Tall and Egg?
I would love to see Valyira 
[Dear HBO..... ](https://media.giphy.com/media/wErJXg1tIgHXG/giphy.gif)

I would love to see the Blackfyre rebellion. By far the most interesting war in Westerosi history
George.................................... Can you just finish the books first dawg? Damn homey...
[Three Thousand of Qohor](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Three_Thousand_of_Qohor)

would make an excellent movie, I think! It's almost Troy-esque.
Yiss
Doesn't GOT sucked enough of my time?🤔
Yes please
I would love if they went back in time for each series. Like start with the Bobellion ending with Robert on the throne (or maybe even a jump to grey joy rebellion at the end), then go Dunk and Egg ending with Summerhall, then Aegon the unworthy ending with the Blackfyre Rebellion, then the dance with dragons, then the faith militant uprising (not too attached to this one), then Aegon's Conquest, then possibly a series based on one or several of the kingdoms of Westeros, then a long night series would be pretty cool. They really could milk this world for all its worth if they did it right (and hell, I'd be ok with it!) The possibilities are truly endless!
ayy
It would be cool if they could throw The Smiling Knight and The war of the NinePenny Kings in there somewhere.

Because id like to see more of Arthur Dayne and Barristan Selmy. Also, young Tywin , young Brynden Tully and a young Jamie Lannister while he was still learning
YOUNG BARRISTAN! YOUNG BARRISTAN! YOUNG BARRISTAN!!!
I hope its story is based around the war between the Stone Crows, Burned Men, and Black Ears!
Oh please yes!
Dance of Dragons for more DRAGOOOONS!
The only prequel I would like to see is - Aegon's Conquest! If you dont know what its about - Read GOT historyblog ! 
I don't know if I'd want that :/
My biggest worry is that they'll portray young Robert as the villain. I know Rhaegar was loved and all that. But I want to watch and be rooting for both of them, conflicted. Not just see Robert turned into some cliché jealous asshole.

I feel like they might make that mistake in order to solidify Rhaegar as the unsung hero. 
"Hey we found something with a rabid fanbase! Let's hammer it into the ground until no one cares about it anymore!"
i would be down for a series that did a storyline a season. sort of like american horror story or true detectives. roberts rebellion season 1, dunk and egg season 2, old valyria and aegon season 3
Everyone knows how well prequels tend to go...
Prequels suck
Anyone else wondering what's there west of westeros? i'm itching to find out.
I would like to see smaller vignettes which don't necessarily have to flow one into another. That way we could cover the doom of Vayria one week and the tournament at Ashford meadow the next week and the dance of the dragons a week later.
Give me a story set in the far east damnit!
They'll go back millions of years, to a land called the United Kingdom. 
Is it bad that I kinda wanted to see the Dance of Dragons story as a series more than a prequel to GoT? mainly because dance of dragons is pretty complex & Robert's rebellion isnt that long of a story.
The fall of valerya/rise of targs/faceless or Roberts rebellion plzzz
Seeing Rhaegar crown Lyanna is my holy grail, find a way to make it happen guys 
Is it a confirmed prequel? Depending on how GOT ends, why not a sequel? Why not both? Etc. I just feel we are limiting them to only branching out into the past. And please, no spoilers. 
I do NOT care what the story or time is that thia is set in. All I know is I want to see places like Asshai and Yi-Ti (especially the 5 forts) and Sothyros on tv since George Martin has essentially said we would not see them in the books. Old Valyria in its glory as well if possible.
Rhaegar and Ned as the main characters of the prequel sounds like a BIG hit.

Too bad that now GRRM will have another excuse to never finish writing the series...
I feel like you could pick any historical event or time alluded to in the show or books, and make a great story out of it. 
I'm not so sure I want to see a GoT series where there aren't any real surprises.
I would go back far enough to see the wall being built as the end of series scene
Persinally, id rather see a new story within the got universe.
I'd be interested in seeing Old Valyria before the doom. 
We demand Stannis and Cleganebowl  
I want to see a prequel where the last 2 seasons are Robert's Rebellion. I NEEEED to see more Arthur Dayne and the rest of that bad ass king's guard do some damage
I'd dream of a Dance of the Dragons era prequel. Equally riveting with EVEN MORE DRAGONS. Also a Targaryen history would be amazing. If not that, the Blackfyre Rebellion is another good storyline that could very well lead into Bobby and the Boys.

Aegon's conquest, old valyria, dance of dragons and Roberts's rebelion
I'd really just love a prequel about Rhaegar from his POV.
Milk
Roberts Rebellion would be awesome. But they'd have to dance around Jon's birth at the TOJ since by the time this comes out we'd already know Jon's parentage. 
Barristan Selmy, more Arthur Dayne, Duncan the Tall, Aegon, Aerys, Rhaegar, Ned & Bobby in their prime? Maybe a callback to Jorah? Sign me up.
Don't do it! Better Call Saul is eh and Fear TWD is horrible. Either continue GOT as it is or let it end! 
A Song Of Ice And Fire
 A Dream of Spring
The Winds of Winter 2: Electric Boogaloo
There And Back Again...
Gnimoc Si Retniw
Imp's Delight
A Time For Wolves

I hope this title makes in appearance since it was scrubbed for A Dream of Spring
A Game of Thrones (repeatitive I know because the series is called "Game of Thrones" but it's the best I can come up with right now).
Ned Stark's Revenge.
Where do whores go?
Not sure about the last episode, but I hope they use A Time for Wolves as a title at some point. 
Oh off season, is there a topic we can't think of?
Endgame.

I like the idea of a single word title.

Cast off: Survivors of the crushing defeat sail west, from westeros....
Drinking and Knowing
"King Gendry Waters, First of His Name"
Winter is Coming 

The second long night has ended, the war for the dawn won but as spring comes the starks have the same warning. 

Or 

Love and duty
And now your watch has ended
I don't know how the story arc will go... there are so many storylines, that there will be at least an episode or two at the very end devoted to wrapping all of it up. 

But I think there will almost certainly be an episode titled "The Battle for the Dawn," a line spoken by Aemon to Melissandre. Which, tbh, is the only battle that has a chance to be more epic than the Battle of the Bastards. 
Morning light
Winter is going
Dreams of Spring
Either "A Dream of Spring" or "A Song of Ice and Fire" for the finale. Hopefully, "A Time for Wolves" might be an episode title sometime in on of the final seasons. I hope the title of the episode where Dany attacks King's Landing (come on, it's going to happen) "A Clash of Queens" (Dany vs Cersei) as that would be awesome. It would be nice to get "A Feast for Crows" and "A Storm of Swords" somewhere as well, but maybe not as likely.
whenever cercei and dany have there battle, it should be called battle of the bitches. 
THE END.

He is a dwarf with a westeros accent and in the books he is hideously ugly 
Most likely he's seen Tyrion before. Jorah fought in many tournies throughout Westeros and more than likely Tyrion was present at them as well.
Tyrion is a dwarf that talks like a highborn Westerosi but is dressed like a commoner. Not hard to put together. Tyrion figuring out who Jorah was is way harder.
I doubt there are many dwarves with a missing nose and eyes of different color. Plus the highborn westerosi accent.
"You walk like a rich man".
Jorah knows who Varys is and certainly knows who the Lannisters are.  Seeing Vary alone would tip him off that the dwarf was Tyrion.

he probably knew him from the time he served the Starks 

tyrion was still always around court？
Wasn't Tyrion running his mouth to Varys and one of the hookers in the bar/brothel in Volantis Jorah was at?  I thought the show made it seem like Jorah heard Tyrion droning on to the hooker about being 'one of the richest men in the world' until recently.  He's also it's well known he's a whoremonger.  Jorah hears 'richest' coming from a dwarf, with a Westrosi accent in a whorehouse and he simply puts 2 and 2 together.  He could have seen Varys too.  
Think we have to assume. Tyrion is the highest born dwarf that I know of, so the way he talks, walks, and acts in general can give it away, especially since people that are rich act very differently in these societies. He also has the golden hair, and while in the show he isn't that ugly, he still has the scar, so that could be a hint. He also is in a whore house, which he is known for, but i'm sure it isn't the only dwarf to be in one.

Most likely just a rich person feeling. Jorah was a lord, or was part of a high family, I don't know specifics, so he knows these things. And to see a dwarf like that, where they were, seems way to out of place to be a coincidence.
Tyrion Lannister is a very wealthy person who everyone in the kingdom knows. He probably has portraits of himself somewhere and Jorah just remembers what he looks like. Also maybe Jorah had been spying on Tyrion for a while before kidnapping and heard people call him Tyrion.
A parry is not a full stop block but a deflection, timing, footwork and angle of the blade can be more important.than strength when parrying, if you angle and time it right you can use you opponents momemtum against him.

Source 4 years studying HEMA(historical european martial arts) long sword while being slightly Below average height(I'm 5 foot 6 inches tall) Meaning nearly all my sparring partners are taller than me.

Also just a being a nitpicky sword nerd, what the mountain uses is not a broadsword. A broadsword is a very specific type of one handed scottish swordwith a basket hilt( A good example is seen in the film Rob Roy or the sword used in the show Outlander). 

The swords used by the mountain would be considered a Greatsword(Zweihander in German, Montante in Spanish) and is actually a early Renaissance weapon. The weigh only about 6-7 pounds for battlefield versions, the realy heavy ones in museums are bearing swords used for ceremonies. Ice is also a greatsword. The mountain is so big that he can use it like a Longsword.

Most of the other sword on the show are one handed knightly swords(modernly called arming swords(think the sword Robb stark uses or show version of oathkeeper )and hand and half swords.which are also called bastard swords.or longswords(long claw is good example).

The books confuse Things by using longsword for what are really arming swords,.which is probably influenced From martin having played tabletop rpgs like dungeons and dragons where one handed knight's swords were called longswords because the games feature shortswords(think gladius or ziphos length swords).


You would only have to dodge it a few times. While they are scarey looking, they are not that functional. Actual fight scenes involving those swords would be a minute tops. Even a very strong person gets tired very quickly, especially with armor on.
If the fight between the viper and the mountain happened in real life, Oberyn would have poked him full of holes very quickly.

<<<used to be in love with a sword and armor maker

He's the voice of Civilization 6. Every couple of minutes he pops up to say something, it's pretty cool if you're a fan.
Well, you got the History and Lore, where the major actors narrate stories about Westeros and Essos.
Whenever I hear hm talk, I hear the voice of the O2 ads. That, or Sharpe.
Nah, they should simply make another GoT series in which Ned fuck them all.
Every time I rewatch LotR now I keep thinking in my head "No, Ned wouldn't do that, he's an honorable man" before remembering theyre two different roles. Played a good Boromir but he hit it out of the park as Ned. I know description wise from the book they probably could have went a different direction but everything else about the character, Bean played the role to a tee

Tbf 99% of us would agree it's Jon who's the "Prince that was Promised". The only thing about the prophecy is that it can apply to so many others. That also depends on the prophecy being fulfilled in a way as GRRM said but don't quote me on it that prophecy is just prophecy it doesn't mean that it's true or something along them lines.

 But I totally agree it's Jon and your post really does give alternative points to show that it's Jon.

 Just for fun tho, Daeny also lost her love in Drago and Rhaego and I'm sure that in future books/show there'll be other things that can make your points relevant to her and potentially others.
I personally see lightbringer as the nights watch itself. The nights watch even killed his lover and will be there to stop the others 
Usually Drogo ones are pretty bad, but damn, dude hit the gym. 
Awesome! The Horse costume is really realistic! 
Thats pretty good.
Your photo has warmed the cockles of this old ladies heart!  As a young woman...I loved riding horses and it was very difficult to find young men who shared my fixation.  As a young adult and even throughout my 20's, 30's, 40's and 50's...I can only remember meeting three men who were interested in riding! 

You look exceedingly fine on your horse!  I envy your partners!

Your cosplay was done really well! That horse looks more like I would imagine Khal Drogo's horse to look than any horses on the TV show! What breed is (s)he?
WOW!  Fantastic job man.  You look awesome!
I can't wait for the "I see your Khal Drogo cosplay and raise you..." post
Thank you everybody, I will putt you one or two pic (my fav) of this shoot when I will get the pictures ;), all the shooting should be there if you're interested : https://www.facebook.com/leobanec/
you look better than the Khals from the last season
Man... cosplayers are so committed!

I mean this guy lifted weights for years and got jacked **JUST** so he could play Drogo.

Pure commitment. Astounding.
that horse is gonna need a backiotomy
"A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal."

***Hilarious*** you said this because Jason Momoa actually hates horses. In fact, in the majority of his "riding" scenes, he would only walk the horse about 10 feet. He would seriously start from just off screen and walk into the scene, that's it.

San athchomari yeraan, Khal. 
Great work! Now show up to ComiCom with the horse!
You can also cosplay as aquaman soon
Handsome. ;3 
Those...pecs....

Eventer/dressage rider here myself. I'm swooning. 
A great cosplay again wasted by pictures taken with a potato. 
You should audition for the show!!
Impressive. You even have a horse! My costumes would be so much cooler if I had a horse.   ;)
Yes, but can you throw an axe for a bullseye after taking a sip of beer? 
dude u nailed it! 
Would probably pass as stunt double!
You are a fucking champion, for having the muscles but mostly the HORSE, because as the title says, a Khal who cannot ride, is no Khal. 
Omg that horse looks so real! Great costume!
Nice job. Also, damn son! You're ripped!
I want to see someone dressed up like this with Tom Hanks SNL character, gray beard and MAGA hat. Carl Drogo.
Which way to the beach?
NGL I was kind of hoping it would be a pic of you falling off the horse, what with the title.
Finally a swole drogo 
Question is..do you think you could get into a Comicon like this?
Looove!
m'ath m'ach
Not Bad!!!!
You don't ride that horse, you sit on it standing still ;)
More pics?

For science?
Cosplay level 1000. Damn you make me wish I was 10 years younger.

Such a cute horse! Draft mix? Maybe percheron? The first pic is my favorite. He's got one ear on the strange human on his back and the other is cocked at the person behind the camera, probably jumping up and down trying to get both ears up, which they succeed at in the second picture. Oh and costume is awesome too. :)
you seem to suck at horseriding but otherwise it looks cools.

Bronn is a Dayne. I've go no evidence supporting this apart from it would be the best thing ever
Bran is the Lord of light 
I think Sam and Tyrion are going to get along splendidly.

I imagine they would be excellent in a Sherlock Holmes-style spinoff where they travel the planet together solving the mysteries and myths of Westeros.  

A Dunk and Egg for the modern post-apocalyptic generation. 

It could happen. 
John will find his own tombstone somewhere in the krypt and discover his true parentage. Ned put his true last name on the tombstone when he was a baby but hid it from the world. 
Varys is a merman.
I love [this] (https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4tzu7x/everything_king_of_the_ashes_how_littlefinger/) theory for the next season that I read on this sub a few months back. 

tl;dr (but you should read it, it's really interesting) Littlefinger and Sansa set a trap for Cersei and pull a Tywin on her, sacking King's Landing when Cersei opens the gates. Jaime kills Cersei, Cleganebowl happens, and Cersei blows up the entire city.
John Snow will become the next Night's King. Lots of foreshadowing for it as well:

King of the North, literally king of the white walkers and the others.

His pet wolf is "Ghost". As a specter of some sort / something undead.

His name is literally Snow. White and Cold. 

Bran knows how to make people undead, by piecing their heart with magical glass/obsidian or something.

Benjen says in season 1 to John that "Here(In the North/At the wall) a man gets what he earns" and that John and he will speak when he returns. Returns from the dead it seems.

So John will take the place of the old Night's King for a few thousand years. - There must always be a ~~Lich~~ Night's King? Sounds like the bittersweet ending we were promised.
Syrio = Jaqen.  


Jorah is Azor Ahai - I really like this theory because Jorah truly is the only person I've seen be 100% motivated by love for a woman. Whether it's his first wife, his second wife, or Dany.

I believe that Dany is going to win the war for King's Landing and the power will get to her head (something similar to King Aerys) and Jorah will realize what she's become. He'll then take Longclaw (which Jon will give back to him) and plunge it into Dany's heart (she's a Targaryen ergo "heart of fire") and Longclaw will become lightbringer.

I'm still unsure of if Jorah will wield lightbringer or if Jon Snow will, but I'm 99% sure Jorah will be the one to forge it.
Davos is the one who was promised.
That soon after Cersei becomes queen, Jaime will start to have PTSD flashbacks to the Mad King days and he'll feel obliged to kill Cersei because she used the wildfire and she's out of control. What she did goes against what Jaime stands for, and although tragic, he'll have to kill her and hold her in his arms as she dies.
Tyrion and Daenerys will fall in love. I don't know what the implications are, but it will happen. Tyrion's already falling for her.
Jon, Dany, Jorah, Tyrion and Gendry get in trouble with the white walkers and almost die but at the last second they use their transmutative powers to unite and become Voltaratron, the most badass cyborg dragon in the universe.  They quickly smash the white walkers into a plate of blue custard and then live happily ever after.  

Sorry for that.

Dany and the Targ Alliance are going to pound on Cercei and the Ironborn. But by season 8 she becomes the tyrant.  The horn mentioned in the books is esed to control the dragons and take power from her and her Dothraki hoardes that stay loyal.  
Because the secret relied on Cat treating Jon like a bastard. People would have noticed if she suddenly started treating him better. 

Plus, Ned made a promise to Lyanna that he would protect Jon at all costs. 
I wouldn't say this has been explained away, because one could argue that Ned could trust Catelyn and his family. However, Ned made a promise to Lyanna. We do not know what it is that she exactly asked him to do. But when he makes a promise, we know that Ned keeps it for love and honor. Here's the best quote from the book to explain why Ned did what he did.

AGOT, Eddard VIII (Chapter 33): "Lord Stannis shared the secret Jon Arryn had died for, he was certain of it. The truth he sought might very well be waiting for him on the ancient island fortress of House Targaryen. And when you have it, what then? Some secrets are safer kept hidden. Some secrets are too dangerous to share, even with those you love and trust."
Because, at the time, Ned couldn't trust her.

Ned and Cat were married shortly before Robert's Rebellion. He got her pregnant in the short time they had, and then didn't see her again for over a year. The next time he saw her, he was bringing a Targaryen bastard with him that he had just sworn to protect no matter what.

As for why he continued to keep it secret, it was probably so that Cat would treat Jon as if he really were Ned's bastard. If Cat suddenly started being nicer to Jon, someone may wonder what's up. Also, Ned probably couldn't be sure how she would react. Cat has no love for the Targaryens, especially since it was the Mad King that killed the man she loved and who was to be her first husband, Brandon.

So in the end, Ned probably just decided that it would be a lot easier if only he knew and everyone else treated Jon as a bastard. The fewer people who know a secret, the less likely it is to get out.
Ned and Cat hadn't been together long when he brought Jon home, it wouldn't be wise to trust anyone with that information that didn't NEED to know. 
At that point at Ned's life his actions were justified. By that time. His father and brother were both dead. And his sister died giving birth to Jon. At that point Ned would've kept any promise for his dying sister just on the fact that he didn't want anymore Starks lives to end. Hell when Ned and Jon talk the final time as Jon heads for Castle Black and Ned to Kings Landing you can see how badly Ned just wants to tell him. And I'm sure he would've had they crossed paths again. And I think that's what made it so hard for Ned, knowing of his 6 children he raised. The one he was most proud of wasn't even his biological son. Jon portrayed a Starks honor and value way more than Robb.
For Ned it's obviously an honor thing. But look at it this way too.. if your husband comes home with a child and says "it's not mine! but we have to take care of it .. because .. reasons." you're probably not gonna believe him.
Neds marriage to Cat was arranged quickly after his older brother was killed.  Ned then almost immediatly goes off to war.  It's likely when he returns he doesn't really know her or her intentions all that well.  

They grow to love one another but by then telling her would cause her to treat him different and thus be noticed.  So he keeps the secret.
Marriages in got are like the marriages you typically think of, they're not "love and behold, all my secrets are yours, love for life" marriages, they are political. Cat isn't Ned, she didn't make a promise to Lyanna, she has no reason to respect Lyannas wishes, no reason to protect Jons heritage. The marriage they had was to secure political union between the Starks and the tullys and to produce children to inherit the north.

Cat with that secret means that secret isn't safe.
She's impulsive and reckless, when she got even the slightest hint that tyrion might be involved in the assassination attempt on bran she kidnapped tyrion and basically left to execute him without any real evidence. She didn't even want to give him a trial, she just called for his head, lannister reaction be dammed. She betrayed Robb and gave away their greatest leverage on the *chance* that it *might* get sansa and arya back, do you think she'd hesitate to betray Jon for her children's sake?
Well, Ned didn't love Cat, and Cat didn't love Ned when they got married. Both of them lost the people they would have preferred to marry and ended up together through circumstance and politics, not love. Over time and through the years they developed a friendship, trust, and finally love through building a family together and through a mutual respect for the other's character. Ned couldn't have trusted her at the beginning, and even if he had the inclination over the years, it became imperative to protect his family from a secret that was extremely dangerous if anyone--especially Robert Baratheon--found out. I get why he kept it to himself. If he carried the burden alone, then his family could act in innocence instead of deception.

Because it would be suspicious if Cat treated Jon, a bastard, like a legitimate Stark, and not a bastard. Plus, if one of her children were being held captive, she could use Jon's parentage as a bargaining chip. So it wouldn't have been safe to tell her. 
Ned barely knew catelyn when he came back from the war, so he wouldnt risk telling her. When she already started treating Jon in a bad way, people would have noticed that something was up, but I highly doubt anyone would have realized that Jon is Rhaegars bastard. I rather think that Ned knew cately was emotional and stupid, even though he loved her.
Wait a minute. Many posts I read stated that Ned couldn't tell Cat because of behavior changes that would be noticed. In one of Cat's chapters she is talking to the wife of Robb and tells the story of why the gods were punishing her. She prayed for Jon's death and after he got sick, she promised she would care for Jon if the gods healed him. She failed to keep the promise. The point I'm making is Ned could have told her then and yes she would have accepted and changed to keep her promise while her change of heart would have been perceived normal with Jon's near death experience. Ned never really trusted Cat. It was an arranged marriage for Ned for honor and for Cat she grew to love him. IMO. 
i wouldn't trust her either.

So so pwetty
Are you sure you're ready to greensee alone?
It did feel like forced exposition. GRRM probably told D&D that Jon's parentage is revealed when Bran looks into the Wierwood trees and D&D just went with it. 

I'm very interested to see the reveal in the author's narration, but that feels more and more unlikely with each passing month.
To be fair, we were all annoyed that the 3-Eyed Raven cockblocked this scene from us for 7 episodes; I'm sure Bran felt the same.
I thought he was gonna touch the tree and meet Bloodraven existing as a warg spirit in the tree to cotinue his training until Bloodraven's consciousness got completely lost in the consciousnesses of lost dead wargs that lost themselves when they died while warged into the tree. (Like what happens if you're warged into an animal and someone kills your human body, you stay warged in the animal until the consciousness is inseparable or whatever)

I felt like it would have answered a few questions and still gotten the reveal and not feel like we missed an important conversation or two somewhere off screen.
I've wondered this same thing. I don't think a lot of people wondered why he decided to do it, I think they were just happy he did. I'm wondering if he had a suspension about what he might see and if he had some sort of plan if he got confirmation. I don't think it was just purely out of curiosity. 
Your question made me wonder why he didn't go back to the TOJ scene when he first dove in by himself (when he got marked).  If it was weighing on his mind why not go there right away?  As for Meera not knowing, I'd imagine Bran shared everything he saw with her...probably wasn't much else to talk about hanging out in a cave for months.  He probably complained to her that he pulled him out of the vision before seeing what was in the tower.  He'd almost certainly tell her that he saw her dad fighting (might have left out the backstabbing part).
I also feel that the scene was confusing to non-book readers or those that don't follow everything as closely as others. I had to explain the R+L=J theory to several people after this reveal. All of them just went, "Oh. Now I get it." So unless you already knew the theory, I have a feeling this scene was confusing to you.
[deleted]
Makes it more dramatic for TV by withholding the reveal until the final episode. 

 I agree tho it wasn't done as well as it could have been. Could of had BR have some sort of cockblocking magic on him going to that specific place until he dies.
I would imagine if Brandon saw a flashback of his father, whom he very much loved, fighting ser Aurthur fucking Dayne and be taken from the vision I would imagine that vision would seem most important to him. At some point he decided next good chance I get I'm going back to then and finding out what the Old Man wouldn't let me see
There was a reason that Bloodraven brought Bran to that vision in the first place, and it was fairly obvious it wasn't just to see Howland Reed save Ned's life. Had the WW not attacked the cave in the first place, I'm sure he would have shown Bran the rest of the vision at some point. Bran hadn't moved on emotionally from that vision, and he knew there was more to it. Especially because he even said that he had heard the story a thousand times, yet the whole significance of the TOJ/what was in the TOJ seemed like a complete mystery to him. Therefore Ned had never brought it up, and having seen the rather dishonorable way Howland backtabbed Dayne to save Ned, Bran deduced there was even more to the story.

Stevron Frey, Walder's firstborn son, made an appearance in the first season and was never mentioned since. As far as we know he is still alive and presumably succeeded his father as Lord of the Twins
According to [The GOT wiki](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/House_Frey), house Frey has no shortage of potential heirs. Edmure would probably be the last person anyone would even consider. In the books, Walder has even more heirs, but even on the show, there are enough. Arya didn't kill all of the Frey men, not by a long shot. As that site points out, House Bolton was rendered completely extinct by the end of the last season, but house Frey isn't even close.
I'm hoping they show the aftermath of Walder's death, and I think it could turn into a Frey civil war. There are so many of them that others will want to be Lord instead of just being another countless Frey like with the Late Walder Frey.
literally anyone... ser pounce even
In the books, the BWB is out hanging Freys every other day.  I'm guessing they roll deep in the show too.
There's a rumor that [potential spoiler](#s "Arya wears Walder's face, holds a feast for the Frey family, and poisons them all. Kinda sorta similar to how she escapes Harrenhal in the books. With that, the Frey line would become extinct, which would be hilarious, horrible, and beautiful.")
With Walder Frey, Black Walder and Lame Lothar dead. I suppose it should go down to Stevron but considering how shit their family is, I expect them to fight over it and probably all die.

He's got kids out the wazoo. That man thought that controlling a vital travel route and making a lot of babies was going to turn him into The Next Lannister Dynasty^TM.

Instead, he fathered a bunch of idiots in condom caps. 
I hope arya kills them all

Does he have sons? or grandsons? lol
Just wait until he meet Podrick "magick cock" Payne.
Winter is coming, and so is Dickon Manwoody. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
The sigil is badass.
I can see the title sequence.

Another great chance missed.
He is the true hero of Westeros.

Bran - I can't see him dying with all of the 3ER activities he's been getting involved with. I think he's too crucial to too many characters plots to die,

Dany - I think she'll sacrifice herself in a battle to save the realm as part of the 'bittersweet' ending. She'll save the realm but never rule it.

Jaime - Possibly die next season in battle against Dany/Jon. His storyline will be spent once Cersei is defeated which should be next season.

Sansa - Live to the end. No reason I can see that she would die, she wouldn't be on a battlefield and is smart enough now to keep herself out of immediate danger. 

Littlefinger - Really hope Sansa brings about his downfall through a crazy double bluff or something like that for all he's done to her and her family. 
Bran - Ghost of Hodor comes back and gets him

Danny - While riding a dragon laying siege to some castle, just before she delivers the critical blow, inexplicably an arrowhead bursts forth from her chest.

Jaime - Falls in relatively shallow water and is pulled to the bottom by his heavy hand and drowns.

Littlefinger - Drinks own poison accidentally 
I am okay with anyone dying as long as it is done with purpose and adequately epic for these major characters.

BRAN - I can't see in dying unless it is in the final episodes of the show. He is too useful of a plot piece and will be crucial up until the final conflicts. But I think anyone is up for grabs when it comes to the very end.

DANY - I see her dying in the final conflict and it will be an incredibly bittersweet feeling. She will make even more morally ambiguous choices and so we won't quite know how to feel when she finally dies. I just don't see her on the throne and I don't see her giving that up until she dies. Low low chance that her final arc will be about finding purpose and growing a life outside of the game of thrones and your preconceived destiny. I think that role could be fulfilled by other characters though.

JAIME - I don't see him living much longer following Cerseis inevitable death. He will have a tragic death of the recently reformed man. Just when he becomes a hero, he dies as a hero.

SANSA - I see her surviving everything. I just can't see a way km which her dying would work considering her entire arc has been about the loss of innocence and finding a way to survive with your limited resources, experience, and knowledge.

LITTLEFINGER - Has to die for there to be an ending to the narrative. He is far too core of an antagonist and with too many enemies to survive. I look forward to it and I hope it is an epic moment.
I feel like Arya is going to kill Littlefinger after finding out about his role in Ned's death...
Stannis kills them all and takes the throne away from the usurpers and pretenders.
Bran travels back in time and becomes the three-eyed raven we see in S6, killed by Night King or not at all

Daenerys is killed by Jon to fulfill the Azor Ahai prophecy. Not gonna happen, really can't see her dying. Otherwise directly at the hand of the Night King. Nothing else is dramatic enough. 100% survives

Jaime I somehow see surviving until the end too. If he dies its via Cersei or the Mountain. Perhaps he kills Cersei to stop her from destroying KL and the Mountain kills him in turn. Once again might die in the struggle against the walkers.

Sansa would be killed by Littlefinger in rage/jealousy or maybe accidentally by Arya. When Arya returns I think littlefinger will try and turn them against eachother. Arya will see through it and kill Littlefinger. 

Of all these only Littlefinger will die.
I don't see Bran dying, but if he did it would be similar to how the 3ER died. Killed while doing something crucial in the past to ensure ultimate victory.

Dany would probably die near the end, sacrificing herself.

Jaime would die slaying Cersei too late to stop the Wildfire from ripping King's Landing's roof off.

Sansa would be betrayed by Littlefinger for standing on his ambitions. Its clear he loves his self-written destiny more than any one person, even Sansa, even Catelyn.

Littlefinger would be hanged or climb the Iron Throne after Kings Landing's destruction, only to be cut by its many sharp edges and die upon it.
Dany - Assassinated by the Faceless Men.

Jaime - Sacrifices himself. Killed by Gregor after he kills Cersei.

Littlefinger - Through the Moon Door.
Bran freezes to death in the cold north, and returns as a wight walker 

Dany goes headfirst with her dragons into battle against kings landing and dies with one of her dragons

Jaimie dies protecting Cersei from Dany

Sansa gets murdered by Cersei.

Littlefinger gets killed by Jon Snow.

Bran - i don't really see him dying to be honest he is to important to the story right now to just kill off

Dany - Dies in Battle for king's landing with one of her dragons

Jaime- probably in the battle for king's landing against Dany and Jon

Sansa - She will probably live to the end

Littlefinger - Sansa poisons him
Bran – Lives,  for sure. 

Dany – I suspect Jorah Mormont will drive a sword through her heart (and from her he'll pull a flaming sword). 

Jaime – I think Jaime will live. But if he does die, I suspect it will be in grand fashion, doing something incredibly heroic (considering his obsession with the white book). Perhaps he'll end up sacrificing himself to kill Cersei and save Dany. It would be weirdly poetic if he died saving a Targaryen. 

Sansa – I suspect Littlefinger will use Sansa to create a divide within the Stark house and then will kill her and try to frame Jon. From there he will try to seize power in the north. 

Littlefinger – I am still not convinced that we know Littlefinger's true motives. I don't believe it is solely to sit the iron throne. That doesn't make sense to me. It seems too obvious for Littlefinger, who famously said (in so many words) that keeping his motivations a secret is paramount to his plans. I think he'll play an even bigger role than most suspect. So, I think he'll be killed near the very end by the Night's King or Azor Ahai. 
I could see Cersei killing Jaime if he started to turn against her. Cersei doesn't seem to care about anything except the throne now. 
Bran will die when Jon has to kill him to stop the Night King from using him against Dany.

Dany will be riding Drogon when Bran controls another dragon to attack her and cause her to fall during the main battle and maybe dying from injuries or gets taken by the Night King.

Jamie will take his chance and kill Cersei and leave himself open to an attack from the Mountain who will beat him to a pulp and then Brienne will Kill the Mountain and Comfort Jamie in his last moments.

Sansa will die when Littlefinger realises she isn't any use to him and maybe kill her when she tries to kill him for conspiring against Jon, it would be a weird moment where he is crying holding her dying.

Littlefinger will die when Arya finds him and Sansa
Jamie dies protecting bran 

Davos broke my heart in that scene. 

Liam Cunningham is one hell of an actor. 
Davos is one of my favorite characters. He rates higher than most Starks for me. Like him more than Dany more than Jaimie but lower than Jon and Tyrion
Shireen's death was the most awful in the whole series. She was a very minor character and so there wasn't any real attachment but burning a child alive at the order of her parents and knowing how much she meant to Davos made it so agonising to watch. 
What's next for melisandre after Jon has banished her? Join with dany? Find someone else to be AA? Continue to work for Jon from the south though?
This Artwork is Perfect
*I never asked for this crown. Gold is cold and heavy on the head, but so long as I am the king, I have a duty … If I must sacrifice one child to the flames to save a million from the dark … Sacrifice … is never easy, Davos. Or it is no true sacrifice.*  - Stannis to Davos. 
I gotta say, Davos has been one of the biggest characters that grew on me over the seasons. I remember when I first saw him season two, and I just wanted his scenes to be over because I didn't know who he was and because I wanted to see what was happening with the Stark children.

Now after reading the books and seeing him in the last three seasons he has completely made me respect his character. They really killed the casting for Davos, and he was able to bring out so much emotion in what otherwise would've been a reasonably emotionless journey with Stannis.
There is this scene where [Davos accompanies Jon and Sansa to Bear Island](https://youtu.be/qIljvhVFE90?t=2m25s). After she asks his nama Lyanna Mormont leans over to the measter, but he interrupts 
```"you needn't ask your measter about my house, it's rather new."```

He didn't know about Shireen back then, but we as viewers did - which made that sentence so heart breaking. Because his house is not only rather new, it is already at an end. He lost his son - first slowly to religion, then to the flames of the blackwater. And then he lost his sort-of-daughter - to religion and fire.

Besides Sam, Davos might be one of the only characters I genuinely wish to make it through the long night and get some sort of happy end and some form of peace for the rest of their days.

edit: apparently Matthos has siblings (who don't show up in the series)
I love the condemnation of the story of Abraham here.
As soon as you consider the idea of a man hearing voices to burn his child — as exactly what the story says, it's difficult to ever consider how anyone could read that as a virtuous holy tale of the morality of faith, especially in the modern era.
One king, one god, one realm.

The Mannis true king

Bend the knee or die
Hell yeah, Davos Seaworth is the best
Davos standing up to Melisandre is one of the greatest scenes on the show
Wow, great artwork. The picture really capture Davos's grief. Good Job!
It's refreshing to see fan art not about Jon snew or danaerys 
When a military commander takes his non contrubuting family members to battle ... either your commander is stupid and is going to get you killed OR that is really shitty writing.
The Broken Man
Sorry for asking a dumb question but she didn't die (yet), and certainly not like this, in the books right? 
But if he commands you to cut their dicks, then surely he is a just and loving god.
Not evil, was doing what he thought was the best for the good of the world.
It looks like he's holding a figurine of Genji 
I keep wondering how the art of ASOIAF will be forever altered by the TV Series. How many artists will be able to omit the influence of the series and produce original interpretations of our favorite characters rather than just the likeness of who played them in the series? I hope to continue to see original work like this.
His delivery in that entire scene was phenomenal....but the way he delivered this line sent straight up chills down my spine. I really hope they give him enough material this season so he has a shot at best supporting actor, because he is amazing.
Nice!
Amazing work of art, captures his emotions very well.
Amazing artwork. Only one thing I'd like to point out. Its Davos's left hand that was shortened not his right hand. 
This is my life .❤️ That damn Onion knight 
I still like Stannis, even though they butchered his character(figuratively and literally.) Melly is still evil since she told him to burn Shireen. I don't care if she brought Jon back in the show. 
r/atheism
The look on his face. Damn.
Or if the adaptation butchers the characterization of a popular character, your writer is evil.
"Stannis is my god" - Davos 
Good drawing but he didn't have that sad look. It was more of a angry/sad one.
Watermark ruins it for me.

I thought this was a cake at first. I would eat the cake out of that cake.
Is this 3D printed?
Wow those are awesome, whats the preferred way to mount them to the wall?

The "gold price" the Faceless Men charge is there purely as a means of stopping flippant demands for a persons death, regardless though, the price is always high, and likely to put the requester in financial trouble, but ultimately within the means of the requester. It also varies depending on the prominence or importance of individual being targeted.

What happens to the gold once the contract is accepted is anyone's guess, but it likely goes toward maintenance costs and whatever charitable endevours the House deems worthy.

EDIT: So you get an idea just how costly it is to hire the Faceless Men:

> Do you have any idea how costly they are? You could hire an army of common sellswords for half the price, and that's for a merchant. I don't dare think what they might ask for a princess.

~ Petyr Baelish to the small council on Robert's plan to kill Daenerys
So u/JascaDucato broke it down a bit but my other understanding is that other than the golden price one can even offer their lives in exchange for an assassin for hire. So if for example you bet on your ship not returning as some sort of life insurance and actually not returned, the policy holder needs to reimburse your family. The policy holder refuses and your widowed wife is destitute, she may not be able to afford the golden price. But she can sacrifice herself in addition to the policy holders life as well. The faceless men get not one but two new faces and fresh new experiences (apparently the masks have other magical properties). 
I've also wondered what is the price for experiencing the "mercy" of the many faced god for yourself or a loved one? Is it free if they determine you meet some sort standard, or can any suicidal person come in?

So nice of Cersei to give Mountain and Unella a break from their rape-fest, and let them out of her dungeons to shame people into being more environmentally-conscious.


If Al Gore got a Nobel Prize for his PowerPoint slide show, then HBIC Cersei certainly deserves one too!!
Haft is such a loveable guy, nice to have him on the cast.
Nice to get some humor from such despicable characters
Why couldn't any of *my* Shame Nuns have been that pretty when I was growing up?

those machines are the best
I think the joke was stretched way, way too long.
Worst part is, the killing of Myrcella was a dishonor to Oberyn... They in fact do kill little girls in Dorne
My guess is that - like pretty much everything Dorne-related after Oberyn's death - will not be brought up. Ellaria Sand will be treated as wanting revenge for Oberyn, not the murderer (and de-facto successor) of Dorne's ruler. The sneks will be treated the same way, not as the murderers of their prince and Myrcella. "Let's all just pretend those horrible Dorne plots never happened, ok?"

**If** Myrcella's death is brought up, I think it will be when Tyrion and Jaime meet the next time (when Dany marches on King's Landing), and Jaime will damn his brother for murdering their father and allying himself to the people who killed his niece. That revelation would hit Tyrion quite a bit I think, because he sent Myrcella to Dorne to begin with, and cause some trouble within the Fire & Blood camp.
We won't ever find out. I don't think they'll bring it to his attention in the show (at least on screen). There isn't to many episodes left for Tyrion to talk about Myrcella's death. 
They're kiling Dorne off now. They are allies of the great Targaryen Restoration.  They can ignore the whole storyline that they destroyed from the books. The whole thing could have been much much better, but they needed to sacrifice something , I guess. 
Probably blame himself

GRRM's actual opinion:

http://grrm.livejournal.com/427713.html
Also this is the dumbest shit I've seen in a while in regards to "salty book fans" 
GRRM fucked up his own story after ASOS. And he's been struggling with it ever since. Can't even untangle the mess and finish TWOW.

So DnD are going to kill GRRM? 
so grrm was poisoned by his enemies? 
Saw this online and had to share! Probably has been posted before but I haven't seen it 
This is gold.
Downright amazing.
I don't think they will be too concerned. Theon will certainly be nervous for how his betrayals ultimately led to the death of Rickon and suspected death of Bran. Jon may forgive him though for the greater good of their potential alliance with Dany. 

Tyrion will probably be glad to see Jon as their leader, I felt him and Jon connected during his journey at the Nights Watch towards the end. Sansa will certainly defend Tyrion for the kind ways he treated her when they were married together.

What do you think?
The thing is, while we know for fact what happened to Jon because we saw it on screen, very few people actually do. Few people saw Jon getting stabbed, fewer still saw him get resurrected. For most people, they HEARD that Jon Snow was stabbed repeatedly and then left for dead. A couple of days later he walked out of a room like nothing happened. If it were you seeing him walk out after hearing that he died, what would you think? That he was resurrected or that he never died in the first place?

I think no one cares all that much because the whole Jon died and came back from the dead is just an unverified myth. Same way that no one seems to care that Dany now has dragons despite there being thousands of eyewitnesses to verify that. People in Westeros still don't believe in magic.
"I see you took my advice of never forgetting who you are to heart, bastard." - Tyrion, probably.
I don't think they will hear much about his death and resurrection until they've met each other again. I don't think the mutiny at Castle Black would've reached that far south. Hell, The Citadel didn't even know Jon was the Lord Commander. So I doubt, they would've hear about the mutiny too.

All they would've known that Jon Snow deserted Castle Black, raised an army of wildlings/ Northern houses, and recaptured the North for the Starks. They might see him as illegitimate or don't really care.



I too, thought it strange that they entirely left out character reactions to him being alive once more, besides the Nights Watch, Mel, and Davos.

The only character to mention that he was legitimately resurrected from the motherfucking blackness, was Brienne of Tarth.  All she said, to Sansa, was: "A bit brooding, well, considering..." And she trails off.  That's it!!

Dude was brought back to life and then won the North back from inherent evil.  But they just choose to move on and away from that BIG plot point.
>the epicness/stupidity that was him charging the opposing army alone

yeah I know this bothered a lot of people but I loved how much of a Stark move it was. The backstory was that the Starks won the north through pure strength and Jon taking back Winterfell by beating Ramsey to near death with his bear hands after charging his, much larger, army on fucking foot is a story for the ages even if the little detail of the Vale riders being the real victors will probably be lost in the songs. 
"...it still really bugs me that we didn't see any reactions from any of the other characters in the show."

We did see the reactions of everyone at Castle Black. The Free Folk think that Jon is "some sort of god," the NW were awed, while some looked uncomfortable. The one who delivered Ramsay's letter just stood there and stared at Jon until he dismissed him. Jon himself is horrified by it. He thinks that it's not right, he shouldn't be here, and he doesn't know why he was brought back. Even worse, R'hllor brought him back, and he would not want to advertise that around the North, which worships the Old Gods.

I don't picture Jon telling anyone unless they ask why he left the NW. Even then, I don't know how he feels comfortable telling people such a fantastical tale, especially when he's trying to convince people to wage war against an army of the dead, when he himself was resurrected from the dead. Awkward.

I am annoyed that we did not see Sansa's reaction. I know she was really wrapped up in her need for vengeance, but she didn't even look awed by Wun Wun.

I think the story of BotB will be that Jon, a bastard, valiantly tried to save the male trueborn heir and fought bravely and honorably. Then smashed the Winterfell gate with a giant and defeated Ramsay Bolton one-on-one. The Free Folk and the Northerners saw courage, strength, loyalty, and honor, not stupidity. Now, if Jon had died in that cavalry charge, a different tale might be told.

I wonder if Varys will be aware of the rumors surrounding Jon. (Ramsay: "I keep hearing stories about you, Bastard.") I'm really looking forward to the Jon and Tyrion reunion. They have both risen high since their last meeting.
I think at this point Theon is going to have to do anything that John says. He has no leverage or high ground on any issue. Tyrion on the other hand is the brains of Dany's operations, I think it is going to be those  two mostly working together with Dany jumping in here and there. She has no clue how the politics work on this side of the world. It probably wont matter if he believes Jon was resurrected or not he has the north behind him. 
My only problem with S6 was Sansa literally not giving a shit that Jon rose from the dead. Like she's one of the only characters that really hasn't experienced the "magical" parts of westeros and she's barely phased by it.   
The Biggest Thing is no body showed any surprise at the fact that a freaking giant fought for jon snow.
Who is going to hear it?  The Wall hasn't sent ravens out about the new Lord Commander Jon Snow--they've been balls deep in more pressing issues.

Thorne didn't have time to send out ravens about it, and even if they wanted to, of the two who COULD send out ravens, one is dead and the other is at the citidel.

When Tyrion and Theon hears, it will be through Varys.  And it will be less focused on the 'they say he came back from the dead' and more 'He took back Winterfell with Sansa, and the Boltons have been vanquished.'

I see Theon taking this news exceedingly well.  (Albeit with a cathartic cry)

Tyrion will probably nod.  'He's a good lad, and the North was never really ours to begin with.'
[I think they'll do a high five.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRY8LYzmnIg&feature=youtu.be&t=78)

Worth the watch? You decide.
I think Tyrion will be the catalyst to Jon and Dany's alliance, knowing first hand the kind of man Jon is, and how he is like his father (uncle), Ned, a good man, that cares for the realm, and not for politics or the squabbling of southerners. There will be two kingdoms, the North, and Dany's kingdom, but Jon may not be the ruler after all is said and done. 
Cannot wait to see the interactions between Tyrion, Jon and Sansa. Also Theon
I can't wait to see the Jon/Tyrion scenes in S7. Tyrion will be the bridge between Dany and Jon since they both respected each other. But I really want to see Jon interact with Theon, with every thing that happened with Robb and whatnot.

Also giants fougt by his side... so much of it sounds like a fairy tale they probably wouldn't believe it
I think Jon's resurrection is being underplayed, because, in light of the realization that all the "fairy tales" i.e. white walkers and dragons, in the GOT universe are real, why wouldn't resurrection be possible?

I expect the books will do a better job of explaining this, and I suspect that's part of what is taking George so damn long to write Winds of Winter. 
If anything, it will be welcome news. Tyrion would have nothing but good things to say about Tyrion. Plus, who would you rather have in the North? Lannister loyalists or people that revolted against the Lannisters twice? It would seem like they would be natural allies, much like they would have possibly been with Renly.
If you're going to give it to a kid and you don't want them to have nightmares I get it. 

Otherwise I'd buy that one, it's got hutzpah. It's got character. It's got personality. I love it. 
You're right, that is embarrassingly ugly.  Six months ago Barnes & Noble had a bunch of Douglas brand dragons.  They usually stacked them by the Harry Potter stuff though I don't think they were necessarily from that series.  I just checked online and the black one is black and gold, not red, so it's not quite what you're looking for.

4>>6>3>>>1>>2>5
Season 2 hands down. Some of the best scheming with Tyrion in King's landing, Robb was in full swing as a military strategist, development of supernatural elements throughout the story, Jon jumping into his heroes journey, excellent shifts of power during a full-on war throughout the 7 kingdoms, Arya starting to find herself (and her dope scenes with Tywin) and the Blackwater. Dany plot was a little slow (only had her wandering the red waste and her time in Qarth), but that was the only questionable storyline.

Amazing storylines, all of them
1,2,3,4,5,6 damn happy I got into this show, I don't have an order cause there is no latter seasons without the early ones. Plus some characters aren't in the latter seasons :( ie Robb and Ned and Oberyn and Tywin. and they totally owned the seasons they were in
Probably go 4>6>2>1>3>5

5 was mostly forgettable outside of Hardhome and "For the Watch" in my opinion.

Truthfully, I'd say Season 6. It was the first season in which I genuinly had no real idea how things were going to progress (with the exception of certain character undeaths), so I enjoyed being surprised for once. After that I would say Season 2 - I thoroughly enjoyed Arya's storyline in that season; her interactions with Jaqen H'ghar were something I was greatly looking forward too, and the dynamic created by expanding Tywin's role added a lot to both characters' development.

For me personally, I would go 4>3>2>1>6>5.
Season 6 is personally my favorite season. We got the most catharsis the show has ever seen. Season 4 is a close second, if not tied. I guess it would be 6, 4, 1, 2, 3, 5 for me. 3, while it did have the Red Wedding, Arya in the Riverlands and Jaime's beautiful development, tended to drag on a bit with certain plots. Theon's torture became tedious at points, and Robb did jack all for most of the season. The last few episodes really saved Season 3 (Rains of Castamere is easily in my top 5 episodes still). 
I don't think there's been a bad season (I even like Season 5, guys! The Sandsnakes sucked but I liked everything else!)

But comparatively: 4 > 6 > 1 > 5 > 2 > 3
1, 6 & 4.
Season 6 has to be my favorite. Although slow in some parts, nothing beats BotB and WoW for me. Season 1 is probably in second place for me.
6>4>2>1>3>5 
6>4>3>5>1>2
People go ona bout season 6, even though the last two episodes were arguably the only good ones.
3 > 1 > 4 > 2 > 5 > 6
4, 2, 1, 5, 3, 6
S2>S1>S3>S4>>>S6>S5
I honestly love every season of Game of Thrones, but after re watching the series all the way through so many times with so many people (rookies led to the slaughter :P) I've come up with my top 2 at least.

Season 4 is my favorite because it never had time for exposition, it was just payoff after payoff of all the buildup from the first 3 seasons. Oberyn, Battle at the Wall, Tyrion's speech, the finale, The Purple Wedding, this season had it all. Also, having such a huge shocker right away in the season made it super exciting from the beginning.

Season 6 had possibly the 2 best episodes of the series yet. Payoff after payoff yet again, the only gripe I had was some writing inconsistencies with Arya's storyline and the way characters reacted (or lack of) to a certain revelation early on in the season. But other than that, this season was absolutely amazing.

Not ranked:
Season 1 is amazing, but does have A LOT of exposition to setup which is a little too much sometimes (especially for first time viewers)
Season 2 has some good moments, but the crown is Blackwater. Also, Tyrion is amazing in this season XD
Season 3 has some great moments too, but the crown is the Red Wedding, which remains the most shocking moment of the series for me.
Season 5 gets too much flack to me. I was thoroughly entertained every week when a new episode aired. Sure, Dorne had some problems, but not enough that the season is automatically "bad" or even "HORRIBLE" as so many whiny viewers like to shout. I love every season of Game of Thrones, but 4 and 6 are the best of the best to me.
S6 is my favourite. It was such a jam packed season and the last 2 episodes are some of the greatest television I've ever watched.

Second favourite is S3. There's so many storylines I loved in that season, and the Red Wedding is still the most shocking moment.

Close third is S4. It was such a fast paced season and the Watchers on the Wall is my favourite battle of the show.

Then S1, S2, and finally S5 is my least favourite.
2 > 1 > 4 > 6 > 3 > 5 

Unpopular opinion, I know
6, 1, 3, 2, 4, 5. But it's hard to put any season last. Season 5 had Hardhome. Season 4 had Oberyn. 2 had blackwater bay and the epic scene between Robb and Jaime in Jaime's cage with Greywind there. possibly my favorite scene in the entire show.

But yeah season 6 didnt have a single bad episode. Totally unreal season. far and away the best by a wide margin. 
From best to least fav:

Best: Season 4

Second Best: Season 6

Third Best: Season 3

Fourth Best: Season 1

Second Least Fav: Season 2

Least Fav: Season 5
Season 4.


Followed by Season 3 and then Season 6.

But if winter is coming, then surely you'll need The Wall?
  Of course. Some times you just have to build a background and set the table for the future action. It is not WWF. 
I just appreciate that Season 5 came and went. There is at least two seasons of content within those books. Some good (Jon Snow/Cersei Lannister/Dorne story arcs) and some just plain boring (Brienne & Jaime in the Riverlands/Tyrion's 'where do whores go?'/Meereenese knot). Sansa and Bran pretty much fall off the face of the Earth. I don't think the show would've survived a true rendition of AFFC and ADWD. It may not have been perfect and the the loose ends were felt until the end of Season 6, but I think the showrunners did their best to push everyone's storylines forward to where they need to be for TWOW. Besides Dorne, it would've been better left cut, I mean there's clearly nothing left if Arianne and Quentyn aren't going to be in the picture. 
Season 5 of GoT is still a better season of TV than 90% of shows out there. The reason people don't like it very much is because we've been spoiled with absurdly great quality of TV from Seasons 1-4, so our standards for GoT are sky-high, and Season 5 clearly didn't meet pretty much anyone's standards. 
It seems like I'm the only one who enjoyed the high sparrow and his shenanigans 
lena's acting was top notch here
I did I loved it... I get why ppl hated Dorne, I guess I was more interested in Jon's plot. Sam. And I like bronn and Jaimie's journey.... as well as Tyrion and Jorah... Tyrion and Dany meeting, kick ass dragon scene and Hardhome. Tyrion owning it. Littlefinger and Queen of Thornes. Stannis and little princess. Just how incredible was that? All of Winterfell with Sansa and Ramsay was brilliant. 

I didn't love High Sparrow thing, that was my only drag. 

Please don't downvote! Ha, I mean we all love the show/books. In many ways I like S5 over S6... Quietness still there, S6 ticked way too fast. THough Jon's plot really was amazing. 
The first four seasons were good because at that point, the fate of the show was consistently uncertain, so they did their best to set-up and knock-down for each season (especially Season 1). While Seasons 2 and 3 certainly set up more than they knocked down, its clear there was a 'big' moment set in motion for both of them. Season 5 didn't have to do that, because it was clear that HBO was going to let them continue to the end at that point. They took advantage of this to build and build, and even the big moments are more or less set ups for Season 6 (Hardhome getting the Wildlings on Jon's side, Dance of Dragons setting up Dany with the Dothraki, Mother's Mercy setting up Jon's revival and hero-worship throughout Season 6). So season 5, in short, was a season that had a lot of build up and heavily relies upon Season 6 to work. Now that Season 6 is out, I feel Season 5 is far more understandable in terms of pacing and lack of real payoff. Season 6 improves 5, but 5 cannot stand up with the rest of the show on its own. I fear that Season 7 may he the same way.
I went back and rewatched it while skipping every Dorne scene. I enjoyed it a lot, even more than Season 2 probably. With the exception of Dorne, I think they did a good job of cutting AFFC and ADWD into one tight (and in my opinion more entertaining to experience) season. A lot of great surprises to catch book readers off guard as well like Hardhome which will always be a top 5 GOT sequence and of course Shireen's sacrifice, which even if you can't appreciate the events leading up to (muh 20 good men), is still one of the most desperate and shocking moments in the whole show, truly horrifying.
I mean people can hate on it and some episodes are pretty bad by GoT standards. However, it has two of the most definitive scenes of GoT in it, the Fighting Pits of Meereen and Hardhome.
I really like season 5, even the sand snakes to a degree. Sue me

I watched season 5 in a day so I didn't have to wait for a year for a season that had ok 7 first episodes, but even if I did I think I would still have liked it. With so much mediocre stuff on tv even "bad" in GoT is still quite excellent.
My first watch through I binged all six seasons and honestly barely noticed a drop in quality. The Dorne stuff was irritating but it didn't kill my mood or anything. I'm rewatching with my dad now though, so I'll see what it's like when we get to it. I'll have to see how he feels as well on his first viewing of it.
I think although it wasn't the best (especially with the Sand Snakes), it wasn't treading water. These are stories that needed to be told and I think they were trying to hold back on revealing too much, hoping TWoW would be released following the season. If it was going to happen at any point, we were all hoping between seasons 5 & 6. I think while writing 6, they just went for it as to not spread themselves thin on story, waiting eons for GRRM to finish writing the books. It was important. Maybe not always thrilling, but important. Still great!
To me season 5 and season 3 are the most boring but i still love them.
Every time I rewatch I get bogged down in season 5 and end up skipping most of it.
I enjoy Game of Thrones period. I think S05 was the worst though (still great!), followed by S06 imo. It seems without the full guidance of Martin's books + all the changes they've made, in some cases it's made a turn for the worse.

Season 5 was like a parabola in terms of how enjoyable it was with each episode, the first and last few episodes were pretty good for GoT standards but the middle ones were just atrocious IMO. Thankfully they learned from their lesson and made it an exponential :)
I liked the blu-ray menu...
S5 was the first season I watched live and I remember enjoying watching a new episode each week. But on my re watch I noticed it really does slow down and very slightly drop in quality compared to the other seasons. It's my least favourite season but it's still great. Lots of important things happen and it sets up for S6. And Hardhome and Dany riding Drogon are some of my favourite scenes of the entire show.
I do. I really enjoyed episodes 7 through 10, with Hardhome being the standout. I even liked episodes 2, 3 and 5 as they had some good extended character building scenes, which I always appreciate. Cersei and Jon Snow both had incredible arcs. I also liked Daenerys and Tyrion meeting. Arya's Braavos arc was more interesting here than how it ended in Season 6. While Dorne was disappointing, I didn't mind the Sansa/Boltons storyline as I think it did change Sansa which was an important plot point later. Stannis' rise and fall was very engaging. While Season 5 wasn't perfect, I think people tend to forget it did have a lot of then good stuff from AFFC/ADWD.
I went back and rewatched it while skipping every Dorne scene. I enjoyed it a lot, even more than Season 2 probably.

Got a cousin of mine into the show over the summer and we tried super hard to get him caught up for the last few episodes of season 6. (Got to watch Battle of the bastards and winds of winter live, what a place to start). In a rush to get there before S6 ended, After the season 4 finale, I skipped most of season 5 gave him a between info dump and we proceeded to start at Unbowed Unbent Unbroken and he didnt seem to miss a beat. Season 5 really picks up the end but the beginning and middle are meh by GoT standards. During this long off season he did catch up and watch those other season 5 episodes and he agreed 5 is probably the "worst" season. 
At this point, I'm buying all remaining seasons from Target or one of their other competitors, and I'm going to try to make a slip cover myself. I'm sure it'll look shoddy, but my completionism won't allow me to have 5 covers and 3 without.
This is pretty much why I wait until a show is finished to buy a box-set. I'll buy individual seasons if they're cheap in the meantime, but yeah. I Haaaaaaate having awkward/uneven sets, lol. It just sucks that there are always so many cool offers and such. -_-
Check this out.  Is that the slip cover you are looking for?

I wouldn't call it "incomplete". You have all the collectors editions available. 
Yeah, I only found this out today. The release kinda snuck up on me. Don't they typically come out at the beginning of the year? I was expecting it next January or February. But yeah, refusing to buy this from Best Buy anymore. Just livid.

I really hope Kit Harington and Lena Headey win. IMO they deserved the most 
Gotta say that Thandie Newton on WestWorld has been top notch.

Good video,but I have some things to say. It's quite possible roose lost men on purpose,although virtually none of them were Boltons. In fact,didn't roose lose at duskendale on purpose so he could eliminate the staunchest of the stark bannermen? Also,it's nice that you arent one of those  people that blames edmure for stannis losing at the blackwater.
Wow, interesting analysis. For some reason this isn't observed with full on consequences more often. Most of the time whenever people hypothesize events, they usually leave out "inevitables" like Lord Karstark's death or the Frey's Red Wedding.
> Game of thrones will return somewhere in summer 2017

Noooooo
It would be nice if the GOT people could somehow work Eline Powell into the show again.
Yes, and thank god it wasn't put in. Felt so forced.

I really want his first words to be "Hello, wife." in his sarcastic voice XD 
There are lots of crossovers between the north and Dany.

Tyrion and Sansa

Jorah and Lyanna Mormont

Olenna and Sansa

Sam/Jon and Maester Aemon

Theon

There will be mistrust but they will face a common enemy in either Cersei or the WW. IMO.
In this world, idk i just think they might be happy to see another decent person is still alive... for now...
I guess my additional thought is regarding the state of their marriage. 

I understand that it was not consummated, and that she married Ramsay after, and that marriage was consummated. So, the marriage of Sansa and Tyrion is completely null and void now, right? She is simply the widow Bolton, with no Lannister ties?
That could be a good marriage to arrange. I'm expecting Tyrion to be Lord of Casterly Rock by the end of the series and Dany and Jon arranging that marriage would bring the Westerlands into their alliance. It also helps that Sansa already knows Tyrion is a good person and husband. He's also basically the only man from the South to treat her well.

1. Tyrion and Sansa are still married in the eyes of the Faith. Yes, the marriage has not been consummated, but a marriage has to be annulled by the proper religious authorities. This did not happen as far as we know. Sansa married Ramsey under the Old Gods and, yes, Ramsey exercised his rights as a husband in a feudal society and consummated the marriage. In a feudal society, a wife has little in the way of rights, she is basically her husband's chattel, a brood mare and political chess piece, so that forced sex between husband and wife is not considered rape. 
2. Ramsey is now dead, and in the eyes of the North under the Old Gods, she is a widow, a Bolton, not a Stark. Under feudal custom, as Lady Dowager Bolton, without a male heir of the House, she has control of the Bolton estates, the loyalty of the Bolton bannermen and their men-at-arms and possession of the Bolton castles. especially Dreadfort. 
3. Now having experienced the worst in men with Geoffrey and Ramsey, her opinion of Tyrion might be different, as the only man in King's Landing, other than the Hound, that treated her with respect and decency. So having Tyrion address Sansa should they meet as Lady Sansa Lannister would be appropriate.
I wouldn't go so far to say Sanda will trust Tyrion, but his kindness to her while they were married can only help.  They also have a common enemy in Cersei (unless Dany takes KL first) and Tyrion and Jon also have a good relationship.  If you take this and add Dany's dragons that can be used against the WWs, and potentially Jon's parentage will have come to light by then, it should be all hugs and kisses....but it is GOT
I expect an awkward but generally positive encounter if/when they ever get to have one (I kind of doubt that these things will get much screen time if any, it is all about plot movement now) but they have no reason to dislike one another. Tyrion was kind to her and she knows it, and Sansa didn't frame him and he knows it. 
I mean, nearly everybody in the show is a shitty person. 
They have a ridiculous amount of ships too for logistics, in Westeros they are essentially the amazon prime for getting fucked up.....that is until the Imp's Delight hits the shelves
Isn't that Olenna's (blood) family?
This confirms it. Everyone who drinks wine on game of thrones is a pedophile supporter, and anyone who likes those characters who drink wine must ok with pedophilia too! 
The Redwynes might own the castles and the land and all that. But I highly doubt Lord Redwyne is the actual dude stomping grapes and barreling every thing.

Westerosi wine is the worlds best pedo juice.
its subway all over again
Why would LF drop this truth bomb?

1.  It is a secret that LF knows Varys knows, so LF loses nothing by sharing it.

2.  LF is showing that he knows more secrets than Varys.

3.  LF is looking to spread the rumor that Redwyne is a pedo, and it is false.


Well olenna was a redwyne. Lord Redwyne could be her brother/nephew.
It's a great scene in the books! Thorne presents the hand to Tyrion :)
Would have been a cool scene to show, but in the books if I remember correctly, the hand actually stops moving by the time he gets to King's Landing anyway - so, not much would be shown from having this included.

He's just broken.  He's been in captivity (and Frey captivity at that) since the Red Wedding.  He's malnourished, mistreated, and probably tortured a bit.  His family is dead.  Father dead, sisters both dead, most of his cousins and nieces/nephews are dead.  He's told that he has a son, the only family he has left, the only other Tully alive.

He's then told that he can surrender Riverrun.  His son will live, his men will live, and most importantly his family will live on.  Family, Duty, Honor are their words; family comes first.  Bran says it best: "In that order?"

He also saves the lives of the Tully men, but that's secondary.  The castle is surrendered without the bloodshed and violence.  After a violent war and the near extinction of his family, he's willing to give up his home for his men and for his son.  I don't think he has anything up his sleeve, he's a man without any cards left to play.  He's doing the only thing he can do at the moment, giving his family a chance to live another day.
He's just a decent bloke who doesn't want his family and his men dying for a pointless cause.
In the books he is send to castle rock to his wife and kid I recall
In AFFC he gives the Blackfish time enough to swim away.
Edmure is in prison, yet the Freys should be in disarray at the moment with the assassination of Walder and his two "most trusted" sons. He has other sons, but if Edmure were to escape, he would be Lord Tully and have a claim on House Frey through his son. If Blackfish or someone could get him, his wife and son into Riverrun with the Tully troops, he could be a thorn in Jaimie and Cersei's side. He must really hate Jaimie at this point, so cutting the Freys off from the Lannisters and the Crown Lands and providing a bridge between the Storm Lands and the North.

Riverrun was built on a river. Unless access to the river was cut off, the castle could be re-supplied and hold out indefinitely. There was no chance of a relief force, so the Freys and Lannisters wouldn't need to build a contravallation to hold out a relief force. So a circumvallation would be built to confine the besieged in their castle. Then a fleet of boats would be organized to block the river, possibly along with a chain or rope to block access to the castle. When Jaimie and Bron arrived with the Lannister troops, the Freys had done little to prepare for an actual siege. Bron got them digging their circumvallation, but the real effort was organizing the Frey camp, fortify it and ensure their were proper latrines and access to clean water. No feudal lords would be as clueless as the Frey brothers seemed to be, but it gave the writers a chance to confirm Jaimie and Bron as "real" Soldiers versus the clumsy, disorganized Freys. Again the besieger once dug in, if not interested in conducting assaults, did not have to out-number the besieged forces. If the Blackfish had gathered 1,000 men, the Freys could conduct the siege with a similar number. That was if all things were equal, and they are not. The Tully forces are led by a "legendary" leader, high morale, castle walls from which to fight from and plenty of supplies. The Freys have little effective leadership, show little discipline or skill and have to be supplied from the stocks of the River Lands, an area already fought over by armies and so stripped of food and fodder. The Blackfish could sally forth, especially by boat, capture Frey fortifications and siege engines, kill Frey troops and lower their morale further.  Since feudal troops served for 30-90 days unless paid, and the Lannisters are broke and government in debt, the Freys would have to rotate their levies through the siege, which would limit the size of their force. If the Freys can raise 20,000 men, at 30 days, they could only raise 1,500 men at a time. At 90 days, they could raise 5,000 at a time. Which means that they would have little left over to screen the border with the North, where the Houses have rallied around the Starks again, or provide a mobile force to oppose the Vale or any threat from the Reach.

Without Jaimie and/or Bron to provide leadership and a backbone of Lannister professional troops, the Blackfish would tear the Frey levies up, eventually breaking the siege and forcing the Freys back on the Twins or into a battle on open terrain. He could deny access to the North and the Vale or provide them access to the Crown Lands and the Reach. He could cut off the Crown Lands from the Reach and the Lannisters from their bannermen and men-at-arms. He could secure access to the Crown Lands by the Tyrells and Dorne, even without Danerys Stormborn's army. And, very important here, Tommen had commanded Jaimie after dismissing him from the King's Guard to take Riverrun back. Jaimie cannot just disobey a Royal command. If he hadn't leveraged Edmure into giving him the castle, he and his troops would have been stuck there until the siege ended, one way or the other.
The death of Blackfish is ambiguous in the show, we don't see the killing and there's no indication that Jamie verified the id of any corpse (not keen to make trouble for Brienne?), maybe he didn't care about anything except gaining the castle (is there really a baby? did Jamie invent the baby story just to pressure Edmure? he's capable of that).  
  
Something nagging is that line killed "by a commoner": that could be crafted to deter any of the significant classes from too many questions, simply because one of their own isn't claiming the credit and its a bit shameful for knights to yield combat glory to commoners.  
It seems unlikely for Edmure to mastermind any secret plot, he is weakened, has been in the dark for weeks so cant be sure who has become disloyal (his men did betray the BF, of course) and mostly the risk that he and his House would lose everything if such news ever got to the enemy.  
  
Could it be Podrick, a commoner directed by Lady Brienne (who are already on a secret mission) disguised a body, arranged evacuation or hiding for BF and got BF's remaining fans to spread a cover story, gambling that Edmure would be reluctant to really hunt and kill his last kinsman? The last we see of BF he salutes Brienne who is departing secretly in fog. Did Brienne finally convince the BF that Lady Stark (Sansa) needed him to survive?  
  
Or maybe the BF sought honor in suicide assisted by ~~Pod~~ his own men.

In the words of his own uncle, Edmure is a fool.  No, he has nothing up his sleeves.
I'm wondering if Arya will let him out of the dungeon in the twins or if she even knows he is there.
I don't know why they didn't use all of jaime's threats from the book. He also tells Edmure that the first men he'all send into battle will be former loyal banner men like Houses Vance and Pyper who were forced to switch sides because of hostages. Edmure would have watched all his men slaughter eachother before a single Frey or Lannister entered the fight. All for some war they had no chance of winning
I don't think there's much more  there than what we saw in the show regarding his thought process there. He was already a broken man, put in chains and half-dead by the time he appeared on screen again...and then he was further threatened with the only family he had left--including a child he has never laid eyes on.  

I might be confusing him with someone else; but I remember a funeral scene were a Tully (I thought it was Edmure??) was unable to hit the funeral boat with his flaming arrow to set it on fire and The Blackfish pushed him roughly aside just before the boat got out of firing range and managed to hit the boat and set it on fire just before it got around the bend in the river.

Assuming that this is right, that scene kind of set the tone for me as far as what to expect from Edmure. Constantly under the shadow of a brusque and demanding man, unable to live up to his elder's expectations or reputation--but mostly, failing to take charge and make things happen when he is most needed. 
Many do. Welcome to the fold!

tyrion is not her brother, tywins last words, "youre no son of mine" 
Yea in the book he started to cut her hair when he grabbed her and took her away from her father's beheading.  In the book it was kiiiiiiiinda weird with his dialogue.
Once Yoren took her away he cut her hair.
She was always mistaken for a boy, even with long hair, because she was always dirty and "un-ladylike". She didn't wear dresses and stuff, she wore boy's clothes.

So she could fake be a boy I thought 
Huh I always thought that she cut her hair she starts her training with Syrio. I'm on my first reread and just read the chapter last night where she overhears Varys and Illyrio after chasing cats. Myrcella and Tommen don't recognize her and the guards think she is a boy.

Holy crap
Desperately needs a tl;dr
I have to be honest and say I didn't read all of that, but I enjoyed the game for the most part. My biggest gripes are [game spoilers] (#p "they kind of wrote themselves into a corner at the end of the season by making the Forrester brothers determinant. We know Telltale's history with determinant characters. Very rarely do they find a way to actually incorporate two different branching choices into a coherent story. Telltale moreso has the illusion of choice, and I'm fine with that, but if so, don't try to sell two endings that are so different and pretend that our choices matter when they're just gonna kill off the surviving Forrester brother at the beginning of Season Two. Also, the Mira Forrester ending was so sloppy. She's alive in my playthrough, but like the other Forrester brother, I know she's headed for death in Season Two. It was a lazy way to wrap up her story. I think they got carried away with wanting everything to be shocking, so they needlessly killed off characters. Oh, and not to mention, what was the point of Maester Ortengryn? All of the foreshadowing was leading to him being the traitor, but since fans figured that out before it was revealed, it's obvious that the creators changed plans half-way through and wrote some nonsensical reason for either Royland or Duncan to betray you if you didn't choose them as sentinel, even if you had agreed with them on everything else otherwise. There were some big mistakes, but I can't pretend I won't buy season 2 immediately when it comes out. haha. And I hope the creators learned a thing or two from the mixed reviews the game got compared to their other titles." )
I agree
I needed something to convince me to go to sleep, thanks man. 
I just hated how they handled the whole traitor thing, with no consideration for anything other than your initial choice for Sentinel as Ethan. Why the Hell did I not get to choose a new Sentinel as Rodrick, anyway? It's so stupid that if Ethan says "Duncan, you can be sentinel" and the Rodrick follows all of Ser Gregor's advice cause you're trying to role play differently, it's still Ser Gregor who ends up betraying you.

I enjoyed the game on the whole, because even though a lot of it was shallow or just rerrunning moments from the series, it was still great fun just to feel like you're there, taking part. But the branching of the story was, as it usually is with Telltale, a pretty big disappointment, that just got more and more annoying as the game went on. Same thing with deaths. Towards the end, it got to the point where a lot of deaths just happened because they had to, and characters were completely thrown away before anything actually came of them.
That's just Telltale for you. Only game I ever enjoyed of theirs was TWAU, and that even got ridiculous towards the end. It's ridiculous and insulting that **half of the god damned characters in the game are copies of real characters from the book and show**. It just proves that Telltale puts 0 effort into making their games anymore, they just pick the most popular series at the time, re-use material, then stall on releasing anymore, only to release another Telltale game. I'm going to be watching Season 2 on YouTube, and my expectations are as low as they can get.
>how did a House, sworn to the Boltons, situated north of Winterfell, end up following the Faith of the Seven, the religion of the south?

Maybe sometime in the past a Whitehill lord converted to the seven and passed to his sons? Stannis converted to R'hllor, the Targaryens converted to the seven, what stops the Whitehills from simply changing religion?
You should have done the games writing! This is an awesome review. Congrats on a well thought out critique.
> This would also handily explain why House Glover couldn't interfere in defence of the Forresters - they didn't want to pick sides in a skirmish between their vassals.

Wouldn't making peace and resolving conflicts between two of their vassals be a part of any lord's job?
I enjoyed the game for what it is. It had a likeable cast and an entertaining story. GoT RPG is still the superior game story-wise.

Great critique, btw. 
I recently played for the first time. Is it the best game? No. Was it fun? Yes. I thoroughly enjoyed myself while playing it. 
I don't have anything to add to your analysis, but I enjoyed reading it! Good work! 
Jesus, can I get a TL;DR
Whoa, savage. This is basically a thesis on what was wrong with the game. Everyone at Telltale that had a hand in it (and it's upcoming sequel) should be made to read this.
Nice rant. It puts all of my gripes with the game into words.

Although I will disagree with you on Finn's "Seven hells", the Josera and Elsera being "Snows", and the Morgryn being a "Lord" parts. 

Finn is at the Wall, a place where a lot of people worship the Seven, it wouldn't be unreasonable that he'd pick up the expression.

Mya Stone is a bastard of King Robert, but literally no one besides Littlefinger, Sansa, and Cersei knows who she is. It wouldn't be unreasonable for Josera and Elsera to be Snows and unknown to the rest of the world.

And Morgryn being a lord of nowhere and nothing wouldn't be unreasonable. In the books, Cersei made a pyromancer and some other guy lords, and they hold no land.

But yeah, you're right. This game was a waste of time.
I stopped reading a couple of chapters in your brick but you seem to paint a very negative picture of the game. I played this game, it was my first Telltale and I'm a hardcore GoT fan and I just ignored the inconsistencies and had a total blast playing the game. It was one HELL of a game for me, I give it a 9/10...

Oh......dear......gods 
I think it just maybe be a bit too much for me to read atm, especially with my phone.
I...kind of feel like this is a whole lot of over analysis. I liked the game so that was good enough for me. But I see that you put a lot of thought and work into this, which I respect. 
I've only played the first three episodes and only read the first part of your critique and will read the rest when I have time but I thought the comparative wealth of Forrester vs Whitehill was due to Forresters only able to sell small quantities because they carefully manage the resource whereas Whitehill cashed out early and have nothing left hence why they're trying to get ahold of Forrester turf before they run out of gold too. I also think saying Forrester ironwood is the defensive equivalent of Valyrian steel is a massive overstatement. It's high quality wood that makes the best wooden shields but it's not magical or impervious to damage. If ironwood couldn't be damaged how the fuck you gonna cut it down and make shields out of it? Do Forresters have magic axes and saws?
It's a Telltale game, what did you expect?
Here's my answer:

Telltale are hacks.


someone post the histories and lore videos before I piss myself!! 
There was a thread on here during the season about how Michelle Fairley and Sophie Turner really did look like mother and daughter, and had a picture of each one's face split down the middle, in a similar effect as [this](http://pre08.deviantart.net/018b/th/pre/i/2012/360/3/5/split_face_portrait_by_kissedbythesunart-d5patnx.jpg). Does anyone have a link to that thread?
I'm particularly excited for this season's Histories and Lore. I think its great that we have some new topics covered by a lot of this season's guests actors/ recurring characters. For the limited amount of screen time that Euron got, these could go along way for characterization. Despite the various times we've gotten Robert's Rebellion, it'll be interesting to see Jaime's viewpoint cover it, as the show doesn't go into Jaime throughout the event as the books go, aside from the obvious ending. The only thing I'd wish is we have Robert Aramayo's Young Ned give a counter perspective on Robert's Rebellion.

For the most part, these deleted scenes while good, they weren't necessary. They spell things out towards the audience, which isn't needed. I mean, its good to see more Ghost since he was on the bench for most of this season, but we don't need a scene to show that Edd is still loyal to Jon. 
Why is there no house sigil themed slip?
Anyone else have really awful quality in dark scenes on the bluray?
It's all blocky and loaded with thick grain.

For Season 6 the Blu-Ray Audio commentary tracks did not play and only the 5.1 surround sound would play. 

I fixed this by going into my Blu-Ray players sound settings and turning the setting known as "BD-Video Secondary Audio" from OFF to ON.

My Blu-Ray player is a Panasonic 5.1 home theatre system and I accessed the BD-Video Secondary Audio by doing the following:

---------------------------

1)Turn on Blu Ray player, make sure no disc is inside the player and update to Blu Ray player first.
2) After updating, enter the Settings menu from the home screen of the blu ray player 
3)Select 'Sound'
4) Select 'Digital Audio Output'
5) Set 'BD-Video Secondary Audio' to ON

-----------------

Hope this helps anyone who ran into the same issues as me, when audio commentary tracks are recorded sometimes they are recorded and merged with the actual audio of the episode as "flat tracks" and other times they are actually 2 different audio streams in order to maintain sound quality - if your blu Ray player is not set to process both sound layers then that is why you are not able to listen to both sound tracks.
Kind of disappointed by the Blu-ray slip cover this year, especially as it's basically disposable, since it has the blue 'Blu-ray' flap thing that just flops around freely. Compared to the season 1 and season 2 sets, the Blu-ray releases seems to be a lot more sparse.
Is there somewhere I can watch all the season 6 history and lore videos?
What is the soundtrack that comes up when Bran is plugged into the weirwood memory?
I've been waiting for the next series of lore videos for sooooo long now they're almost upon us
I can't decide if my copy is overly dark or if that was the way it aired.  It seems like scenes with people in them are dark like to where you can barely make out who they are. 

When I started the first episode it was stuttering and all digitally. I ejected it and started it again and it played like normal.  So I'm not sure I'd it's extra dark because there's something wrong with the disc or if that's how it's supposed to be.
Was almost done with GoT after season 5, but wow Season 6 brought it back
The bluray of this season has some amazing extras! Can't believe there are 13, that's T-H-I-R-T-E-E-N commentaries on this set. The documentaries are amazing as well. God I love this show and almost everything they do.
Nym didn't become feral and run off. She protected Arya and had to be chased off by force for her own safety. She is now thriving in the South where direwolves never have.

I've seen people pick up on the direwolf foreshadowing the Stark’s fates. Over and over, George emphasises their importance. They are a part of eachother...etc. 

I think with Sansa, Lady was the least wolf-like and more docile just like her master. Her death was at the hands of another Stark because she was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Ominous.
Where are you getting this idea that nymeria went feral?
I think the direwolves might still be symbolic, but not as simply as we first thought.

* First there was Lady. When she dies Sansa's pure innocence does as well--Lady's death might represent Sansa's first glimpse at and step into what is going to be a very cruel world for her.
* Then Nym is chased off to live in the wild by herself, obviously paralleling Arya going off by herself for such a long time.
* Jon snow still has his direwolf and it is just as strong and faithful as he is.
* Rob's wolf dies at basically the same time as him. That one is more obvious.
* Rickon's direwolf was beheaded. This parellel also seems obvious as Rickon dies soon after.
* Summer is the tricky one.... he died fighting against wights but it seems unlikely Bran will die any time soon. The only thing I can think of is it represents transitioning from normal bran to the 3 eyed raven somehow. Or, whatever.
I think it should be mentioned that Jon's direwolf is named Ghost and Jon was brought back in to life. Ghost was in the room at the time.

I thought about this theory earlier. When it got to sansa I thought 'well it can't be true because Ned killed Lady with Ice'. Then I remembered that Ice was forged into two blades, one based on the oath Jaime and Brienne swore to Lady Stark over the protection of her children, and the other named widows wail... and I thought, oh man maybe there's more to this theory than we though. Also considering how Summer died I'm sad for Bran
Some men just want to see the world freeze.
It's pretty ironic that the Night King and the White Walkers appear to be the only character in ASOIAF that does not have a motive. A huge reason that Martin wrote the series he did is because he believed that fantasy had become too black and white. He wanted to upend the trope that bad people were solely bad and good people were fastidiously good. Everyone has believable motives...everyone except for Night King, at least so far as has been revealed by Winds of Winter
The Night King is shownly, so any info we have on him or his motives are in the show.
He wants to be the protagonist. 
The Night King wants his humanity back. I am not sure what he needs to do that but whatever it is, it is south of the wall. In order to get south of the wall and get to whatever will restore his stolen humanity he raises the dead and a hell of an army.  

It is ironic that he has had to become completely inhumane and murderous in order to get that back. He does not just want a release like death. He wants to live the life that was stolen from him.  

It may resolve eventually with Bran going back and stopping the CotF from creating him.  This would completely change the future and we may see that none of the characters we have grown to love and hate are still around. Westoros, or whatever it will be called then will be completely different.  It would be unexpected for sure.   Bitter sweet as well.  All the lives and people that we got to know are forever gone and replaced by some other folks that live there.  It is a crazy tinfoil idea.  
Not sure what the Knight King wants exactly. However, since they were created by the children of the forest, it seems they continue in wanting to get revenge against humans and in so spread their territory beyond the Wall.

In a way I see it as they were created for this purpose, and Westeros has only been able to contain them but it becomes harder to contain them in the long winter seasons? Idk
I think we are yet to see his real intentions. We know they were created by the children to stop men, but then turned on their creators and were defeated. 
From what I got when the Night King and his army destroyed the cave is that it was personal to him maybe, after all it was them who turned him into a walker.
I think the white walkers motives may be revealed in the next season.
I wonder, in the books whitewalkers have language that sounds like screeching ice. So they *can* talk, just in the TV show they don't try to communicate at all, just go straight for the kill. Maybe except on the Fist of FM, where we saw WWs making those screeching sounds. One looked directly to Sam's eyes and "said" something (to Sam?) and let him live... Seems that this particular WW had some feeling of empathy to terrified Sam. 

We know First Men spoke Old Tongue (giants and some wildlings still use it). CotF also have their own language (True Tongue).

If CotF created WW from Fist Men, what is this WW language? Can WWs (as former human beings) understand Old Tongue (of course, not counting Craster's babies). Can CotF understand WW language?
Death. That's all. He's death incarnate.
My belief is that the Night King is simply looking to fulfill the purpose for which he was originally created; he was created by the Children to destroy man - at the time, the two peoples were locked in brutal conflict - but clearly the Others' fail to see the distinction between Man and the Children, or at the very least do not care for it.
The Children of the Forest created the White Walkers as a weapon against the First Men. The Children and the First Men arrived at a peace, and there was no place in it for the WWs. They were driven by their creators and the First Men into the far North and the Wall was built to keep them out. Thus the WWs basic motivation is killing humans. It's "programmed" into them. The Night's King or Night King is something else. Evidently a Lord Commander of the Night's Watch was suborned by a female WW or witch in the North and was transformed into a WW with free will or at least the ability to reason. Under his leadership, the WWs and the wights attacked the Wall and almost won through. The Queen was killed and the WWs beaten back by the Children and the First Men. Driven into the far North, there was room outside the Wall for humans to gather, whether voluntarily or involuntarily sent beyond the Wall. From these people arose the Freefolk or Wildlings. 

What is the Night's King's motivation? Revenge for the death of his Queen? Or has the original "programming" become imperative and his mission is to destroy all humans (Mars Attacks, anyone?). Notice that while they made a pact with Craster, it was at the cost of Craster's sons. This did not imply that they would negotiate similar pacts with other humans. Otherwise, the NK and the WWs showed no mercy at Hardhome or any where else, the WWs and wights killing every human in their path. The NK had a chance to communicate to Jon any demands, desires or requests, to open negotiations at Hardhome. Instead, he had his army of wights drive the surviving humans into their boats and raised the recently dead into his army. So his motivation must be that originally implanted by magic into the WWs, destroy all humans.
I got to admit, the theory about the Night King searching for his humanity is a pretty good one. He could also be simply raising hell (quite literally) because he's a dead ice creature with no sense of morality. However, I think Martin included him and the White Walkers in the plot because they're the only characters in the story that seem to be truly motivated by death and deconstruction. While everyone else pursues their own agendas (whether it be to conquer, fall in love, or find safety), the Night King and his army serves as this stark contrast who simply just want to kill. Coincidentally, they drive the plot further.

You should know that Iwan Rheon actually auditioned to get the part of Jon Snow. Just imagine that he'd wear a similar wig... I don't know how to feel about that! 
He doesn't look sombre enough lol
hmmm... no.
Something about Iwan Rheon's facial features are what make me hate Ramsay so much. So no thanks. 
Not fair, you took a picture where he smiles.

Wow this is awesome especially since nice Christmas is coming, (winter is coming)
I didn't think Mel's prediction was in regards to who Arya would kill, simply who's face Arya's will use
The Valenqar prophecy does not contradict your thoughts.  The prophecy only says the younger sibling.  It is not gender specific nor does it specify that it will be Cersei's younger sibling.  It could literally be anyone with an older sibling that can kill her and still be in line with the prophecy.  I like the thoughts and especially that Mel just goes with it even though she sees her own death at the hands of Arya. 
I apologize if this has been discussed already, I just hadn't seen it before and thought others might be open to talking about it!

Yup, Arya kills people.

Riveting theory.
Is Mel even on her list anymore? I haven't heard Arya mention her or Beric since season four and her more recent lists seem to have gotten much shorter.
I always thought since last that the show set up Mel to be tired of battling in her own right for the Lord of Light. Not that she turns away from it. Think of it like battle wounds. The last shot of her old wrinkly self staring away in the mirror really reaffirmed this for me. Dying at the hands of Arya seems likely. 
I think the Trant and Waif kills may fall into this theory just because both got their eyes ripped out.  
Walder is probably the blue eyes as he does have blue eyes
LF = no one?!?!
I never noticed that at all. They do sound similar but when Littlefinger is telling the story, the song is way in the background. Almost not identifiable. I tried a few times and heard the eary similar parts though.  Maybe it was the default sick music. You can hear another tune in there too from the series.

Coldplay's Game of Thrones musical that they did for Red Nose Day a few years back is excellent. It features members of the cast and Liam Neeson as the narrator.
Dunno if you mean single songs or longer-form shows but if you're in Chicago or LA check out [Thrones! The Musical Parody](http://thronesmusical.com/). I was lucky enough to work on the show during its run at the Edinburgh Fringe and it's hilarious, really good, and is eminently watchable by 'proper' fans as well as more casual GoT viewers.

There's people on both sides. Personally, I'd be fine with either, but I can see the Jon/Dany disgust since they're aunt and nephew, and I can see the Jon/Sansa disgust because even though they're only cousins, they were raised as siblings. 
both turn me on
Jon and Dany have never met.  Sansa was raised as his sister all of his life.

I personally don't think they're going to entertain that idea in the show, Jon wouldn't fuck Sansa haha, just not gonna happen.

Jon/Dany has been building since the beginning, they're clearly the "Ice and Fire" personified.  Now I don't know if they'll actually hook up, but it would make sense as Dany needed a Westerosi lord of a great house to take as a husband.

Jon and Sansa will not happen.  Jon isn't going to stop being Sansa's "sister" once he finds out he's a Targaryen.
We're in George's world of where incest is normal and when I look at it neither really is incest by the laws. Ned's parents are cousins and there are uncle/niece marriages. Jon and Sansa is more gross because they grew up together. Jon is not going to suddenly see her differently because they're now cousins, same with Sansa. Neither of them displayed any romantic intentions. Jon and Dany didn't even met but probably will and interact intimately. Not really fand of either of those ships but Jon and Dany is not more gross than Jon and Sansa, more likely to happen.
Jon/Dany makes way more sense!  They're Targaryens and they haven't even met yet.  Jon and Sansa were raised as Stark siblings so they have the taboo and the westermarck effect. 
Neither are ok.
Jon/Dany has backlash because it might happen, Jon/Sansa is just silly shipping so people let it be.
I've found it the opposite way around. Mostly its people who tell me Jon/Sansa is gross but Jon/Dany is okay. 


Personally I'd prefer neither. Jon and Sansa makes me cringe more than the idea of Jon and Dany I guess. 
I honestly think both are a little gross. Jon and Dany seems more likely since Jon and Sansa are like brother and sister, but I'd rather that none of them hook up with each other. It also seems like it'd be too easy of a match, hooking up the most important male and most important female character.
Sansa is generally better liked on this subreddit.

Anyone being on the Jon/Dany or Jon/Sansa ship can't shrug of the other on grounds of being gross. Even though cousin marraige is more common than aunt/nephew. Its simply that Jon/Sansa are far more compelling than Jon/Dany in terms of story. The whole trope of a Targaryan and Stark marraige ruining Westeros and then a Stark and Targaryan marraige saving it , where everything comes in a full circle is much more appealing to me than Jon/Dany where two major characters uniting in the end to defeat the ultimate enemy. Jon/Sansa are far more complex in terms of relationship tangent. They had been supposedly half siblings earlier which would no way make their relationship easy on them. But they can come around to build a life from the ruins just how Ned/Cat did. Jon/Dany can happen. But so does Jon/Sansa after how director's played with their scenes in S6. 
Neither are ok both are gross. I hope Jon finds him a fine ass southern girl
There are plenty of examples in history of deliberate incest to maintain the "purity" of a "bloodline". It was customary for the Egyptian Pharaohs, such that even the Macedonian Ptolemies adopted the custom as Kings/Queens of Egypt (being King or Queen did not automatically make one Pharaoh). The Hapsburgs in the modern European period intermarried, at the level of first cousins, getting dispensations from the Pope for the marriages. So while the Faith frowns on such things, the Targaryan custom supports a Jon and Dany marriage, where Jon knows of his real heritage. As far as half-brothers and half-sisters, the determining factor would be Northern customs. If it didn't bother the Lords, then Sansa marrying Jon under the Old Gods (despite being the widowed Lady Bolton and married to Tyrion Lannister under the Faith) would be a way of insuring the survival of the Stark name and bloodline, since Jon was legitimized by the acclamation of the Northern Lords. 
Because Jon and Sansa grew up together as half-siblings (even if Sansa kept herself distant).

He saw her being fed by her wet nurse, etc.

edit: Oh mixed that up. You think Jon/Sansa is OK? You sicko. 

It's fiction. It doesn't matter.
[Because he is](#s "dead as shit")
That's something the faith militant does and they're just the military arm of the faith of the seven it's not something everybody in the faith does. 
The Warrior's Sons (one of the orders of the Faith Militant) carve seven-pointed stars into their foreheads, like the Andal warriors did. Septons don't do this, not even the High Septon.
A slave owner doesn't brand himself.

Shae was Tyrion's whore, not his wife. She had no obligation to stay on his side. I also personally believe she never held any real affection for him in the first place. And Tyrion kind of knew that deep down, he was just ignoring it. He set her up with all these nice things, paid her for the girlfriend experience, and then took it all away when he married Sansa. He played himself.

Long story short, she's in it for the money, and Cersei or Tywin or both probably offered her plenty of it to testify against Tyrion. Or threatened execution. That's my take on it anyways. There's also the theory that Tywin placed Shae with Tyrion from the start, but I don't think that one holds up very well.
She was probably forced to, else she would have been executed by Tywin.
Shae is a whore, but it also means she's a survivor.  When she shacked up with Tyrion, she was able to get a better life for herself by getting paid by someone wealthy.

Eventually she starts to see the writing on the wall that Tyrion is fucked, for a survivor it's better for her to throw her lot in with the winning side.  She is your ultimate example of a gold digger.
I read a theory once that Shae was working for Tywin all along as a means to distract, and spy on Tyrion.

Personally, I think she actually loved Tyrion.

She stupidly came back to King's Landing, got picked up by Tywin's people within a hot minute. I bet she tried to fight for a few moments before being overpowered. I mean, she has twigs for arms. I don't care how fierce she is if she can't penetrate armor. She probably realized real quick that if she didn't turn on the charm and give up what she knew, Tywin was going to have her tortured for the information. As it was, Tywin forced her to testify, probably on pain of death (though maybe she did it willingly because she didn't want to anger him). If Shae thought she was manipulating Tywin until she could find a means of escape, Tywin knew was she was up to and kept her under his thumb. 

Alternatively, she could've been angry with Tyrion for turning her away and gone to Tywin herself... or been picked up by his men after returning to the city and gave Tyrion up willingly on condition of being Tywin's lover. She obviously felt some remorse / regret during the act and shortly after, but maybe she convinced herself she'd done the right thing for herself; that there was no saving Tyrion. Personally, I like this theory.

Maybe she worked for Tywin the whole time... I dunno. It would be like him to do that sort of thing. She didn't seem to try very hard to convince Tyrion she was still loyal to him when she saw him that last time, but he was holding a crossbow and had murder in his eyes. 

Personally, I think this aspect of the story is one of the best parts of GoT. Was she a spy for Tywin? Was she doing what she had to do to survive due to her love for Tyrion? Or was she playing a game the whole time and doing whatever she could to advance her own position?
I always felt she was sent by Tywin to "keep tabs" on Tyrion.   

Tywin knew how much he loved whores due to his first marriage.  He also had a reputation throughout the nation that the imp loved the company of whores.  Tywin also comments "Don't bring that whore to court" when Tyrion arrives in King's Landing.

He only makes it known of their relationship (spy, whore, whatever kind it is) once Tyrion is in Jail with an execution pending. 
Ed is not the 999th Lord Commander because he has not been elected to the position. He is just serving as acting commander in the same way that Thorne did. 
> D and D
If you're counting Ed as one of the LC's then he's already the 1000th. Thorne was the 999th with your system.
I have been convinced since I first read GoT 4 years ago that the wall would fall before a 1000th lord commander was elected. It was while Tyrion was marveling over how amazing a 700 ft tall man made ice wall was that I thought... "why put a big ass wall that's an absolute wonder of human ingenuity?... To have it come crashing down in the most dramatic way possible... that's why." I am so convinced it's going to come crashing down, and it's going to be awesome. 
There won't be 1000th lord commander. The wall most likely will crumble down so there's no need for castle black or the night watch anymore. If there's a 1000th Lord Commander (figuratively), he is Azor Ahai. 
It'll probably collapse right after the 1000th is elected.
The 1000th LC will be the victor of CLEGANEBOWL!!!

100% Confirmed!!!

GET HYPE AND EAT ALL THE CHICKENS!!!!!!!!!

>we have only seen these dragons in warm, summer climates.

Dragons resided in Westeros for over 200 years. During this time they have seen many winters. Several Targaryen dragonriders visited the North, some even went beyond the Wall and burned down a wildling army to stop one of their attempted invasions. Dragons will be fine in the winter. 
Wouldn't put too much into this. If you haven't heard the rumors of the WW and dragons then I understand. But yeah I literally think the dragons meeting the Night King is the Song of Ice and Fire. I don't think "winter" will affect the dragons in any significant sense. 
Thanks for replying everyone, I never considered the previous winters and i never knew about queen Alysanne. 
Good theory. The colder weather does make lizards more lethargic. But these guys breathe fire. Not sure if that's better or worse for them. Very possible. That may be why there's speculation of the NK taking one of them down and turning it into ice dragon or whatever.

I'm pretty sure Jon didn't pick up the spear because he was exhausted and in shock from almost dying and fighting the White Walker. That and when he did come to his senses after Edd reached him, there was a waterfall of wights coming after them. Though it would be cool if they had an ice spear, it kinda makes sense why Jon didn't pick it up. 
Tell that to him when he's in the middle of a zombie battle.
Taking it would have been good, but more for armour than trying to copy it. We don't know that the White Walker weapons work against them, and the Watch would have nothing to test their recreation attempts against. If they were to try and make armour that isn't VS that works against their weapons a captured weapon could be used for tests.
It is entirely possible that the "ice" assegai or falx was a magic weapon which could not be wielded by a human, like the blade would melt if handled by any being giving off heat.

Probably alone.  While yes joffery did show her how the crossbow worked, he's the only one visible in the room when he kills ros, and makes no action to indicate anyone else is present.  

Aside from the fact that we saw Margery in the same scene as the crossbow previously, there is zero to suspect she was there.
Well if im not mistaken, joff asks her if she thinks she could do it (kill someone) and then she say's , do you think i could do it? he says yes, then she asked if he'd like to watch her do it. or am i making things up?
the way she acts and talks, i wouldnt say there is "zero" to suspect that. She was really trying to manipulate him at that stage, I dont think its a forgone conclusion she had nothing to do with it. i feel like she would have done anything to gain favor.

We know from *The World of Ice and Fire* that King's Landing has a population of about 500,000 and is the largest city in Westeros (Old Town has about 400,000 inhabitants). GRRM has said that Westeros' cities are nowhere near as large as the cities in Essos. Think of KL as a (smaller) medieval London while the Free Cities and Slaver's Bay are analogous to Constantinople, Rome, Cairo, etc.
I would bet that most of Essos' cities are bigger than King's Landing. Most of them have been around since before the fall of Valyria & the Ghiscar Empire that controlled Meereen & the rest of Slaver's Bay was thriving even before the rise of Valyria. I'm pretty sure Qarth is the biggest city though. 
By area, not population it would be Asshai:
 >Asshai is a large city, sprawling out for leagues on both banks of the black river Ash. Behind its enormous land walls is ground enough for Volantis, Qarth, and King's Landing to stand side by side and still have room for Oldtown.
 
 There could be bigger cities somewhere, but we haven't heard about them.

Was listening to "history of westeros" podcast. Their video on Asshai said that it is larger than kings landing old town and some of other cities put together iirc. Although only 1 building in 10 is populated, the entire city is made of black stone, no animals can live there and nothing can grow. 

We never see it in the show or books, but it is referenced a lot, id recommend the podcast lots of really cool info and theories.
Volantis is the biggest that we have seen, or perhaps Qarth. Volantis is the first daughter of Valyria, and is the largest and second most powerful of the Free Cities (Although Daenerys may have something to say about that).
By square feet I believe it is assahi

I don't recall if they addressed it in the show, but in the books he just bailed on Stannis.
You're exactly right. Also a large proportion of them were destroyed by the autumn storms while Stannis was at the wall and sending out envoys to various lords. 
They probably dropped the Wildlings off at Eastwatch (with a couple probably taking the opportunity to sail to Pentos or Myr and sell the wildlings into slavery) before sailing back south and going back to pirating.

It was Stannis' fleet. His ships and they're Jon's now. They will serve them probably to carry soldier and dragonglass from the South to fight white walkers.

As to Salladhor Saan. Maybe he went to do his own bussiness and being a pirate. He was a really good character and funny.

You look like a mixture of Margaery and Catelyn
The one of the left is gorgeous. 
Arya looks like she changed faces one too many times.
I actually think "Margaery" resembles Mira Forrester a bit. 
We get it, this chick looks like the actress that plays Margery.  There has been at least one cosplay post per week for the last 2 months with her.  
Does Margery have a number?
the woman in the left is surprisingly close.
the Margery girl looks way closer to sansa
I never see Cersei cosplays and shes my fav :(
More like mother and daughter - cat and Arya 
Wouldn't it be funny if it came out the actors of GoT were trolling the internet community by posting pictures of themselves and claiming to be cosplayers?
Pretty sure that's Atreyu.
Awesome
\#smirkreversed
Looks nice !
As Khal Drogo I can say you : Nice costumes !! :D
Where you from ?
bad Arya
I'd say Sansa and Bran but OK. 
This Margery actually looks better. Wasn't expecting that.

Not so much cosplay as having been born with similar facial features.
No wonder they deleted it. Ghost looks terrible in some shots. /jk

It's actually quite cool to see this scene unfinished with placeholder graphics. Too bad they had to delete it. There really wasn't a lot of Ghost in Season 6.
I can see why this was cut.  No one needed to be reminded that Edd was on Jon's side.  

This was decided early , hence, the rough CGI.  
I actually wish they would have kept this in. I remember wondering how Edd just managed to walk out of Castle Black without any trouble when they were keeping Jon in the chambers.
Any scene with Ser Alliser is good in my book!
Look at Ghost, lol!
Ghost looks life-like. Amazing work by the CGI team.

Yeah, I can definitely see why this was cut.
This scene just seems like drama for drama's sake. More and more of the show is becoming like that now :/

The direwolves also mirror their masters personality traits through their connection. Sansa's wolf was the least wolf-like, smallest and very docile. Her master was always more Tully and Southern. Shaggydog's wildness reflected Rikkon's temperament. Ghost was the biggest of all his litter mates, he was also mute and an outcast of sorts.

It's also interesting to consider the relationship between the wolves. Ghost was the loner yet he was closest to Nymeria. Now as a Queen she is Alpha. But at Winterfell, Nym showed submissive behaviour to Ghost and she followed him. Ghost has heard her howl and sing to the moon while Jon is warging him. Arya is a continent away warging Nymeria as well. In the Mercy chapter in Winds, Nymeria appeared to be heading North. Will she meet Ghost again? 

Another interesting foreshadowing:

Direwolf:  NYMERIA

- Arya's is named after a ruling Queen who sent 6 petty Kings to the Wall and was a cunning commander and fought several rebellions. She ruled a Kingdom for 27 years and married several times, including a Sword of the Morning from House Dayne. 

Direwolf: LADY

- Sansa's is named after her strongest character trait: Being a lady. 

Ned speaks to both girls about their futures:

- He tells Arya she will marry a **King** (making her a Queen like her direwolf)
- He tells Sansa she will marry a **High Lord** (Making her a Lady like her direwolf)


George confirmed AGoT has the **most** forshadowing of any in the series.
Summer dies when winter starts. Shaggy Dog is named after a long winded, irrelevant and anti-climactic type of story (like Rickon's story arc ends up being).

This is a fairly common theory on reddit.
Since you may have typed this up for me, I have thrown you a glorious upvote.  I think your only problem is that the similarities between the wolves and Stark kids have been apparent for so long (20 years) that it has been discussed ad nauseam.  However, we do have more books and seasons to work with nowadays though so there are definitely some new things to mull over.  

Nymeria was a queen and it may foreshadow Arya's final journey with Gendry.  Last season, Arya starts to ponder really out of the blue, "what is west of Westeros."  In previous seasons, she also had a very tight bond with Gendry who referred to her as his "Lady."  I don't think Arya will die, so her sailing off at the end with Gendry (who is a king or prince by some definitions) fits the idea that she will be his Queen.

Bran is more interesting since Summer dies while Bran is warging.  Perhaps Bran himself will die while warging in another time.  What happens then?  His spirit may live on that way, but trapped in another timeline.  This satisfies several theories, mainly that Bran may be the original Bran the Builder, etc.  There is also the fun idea that whichever of the Stark kids King Robert touched in the first episode dies, and it is unclear if he actually touched Bran.  So Bran's ultimate fate may be ambiguous.

Overall, I don't necessarily think the wolves "fates" are tied to their Stark owner, because I think Sansa will for sure survive to rule the Eyrie.  Robert didn't touch her after all.  The wolves do foreshadow a great many other things though, as Lady's death certainly revealed that Sansa's journey as a Stark came to a sudden end.

I couldn't find it, but I swear there was a quote somewhere about Ghost outliving them all and I did take that to mean that of all the Stark kids, Jon would live the longest.  So maybe Ghost will die of old age... the only direwolf to die a peaceful death.


Well ghost is red eyed and white coat,which is a hint at jons parentage to me.And the name ghost signals to me at least,that he was invisible and it wasnt a true name.
I took the death of summer as the end of the long summer and the start of winter other than that and the jon theory that he warged into ghost yeah I agree.
Yeah, guys, about that lightbringer thing, Azor Ahai killing someone he loves?

>since we have Ned kill Lady

Doesn't Jon bear an uncanny resemblance to Ned in terms of commitment, honor, justice? Sansa is dead already, Jon just didn't stab her yet.
Bran will posses Drogon maybe even becoming the dragon in death.

I've always wanted to see Highgarden! Please be true!
It's not Casterly Rock but I'll take Highgarden.
It wouldn't be all that surprising if they use the same castle for multiple locations. IIRC, they are doing that with the dragonstone setting. They're dubbing it for multiple locations.

Mormont Brand Old Spice: the perfect deodorant for when you have to stand a lot.
Are these real or fan made? 
Wow. Just wow. You show off fragrances and STILL forget to include House Tyrell? Just because of recent events, they're still beautiful in my heart. 
Smells like death
Wolfthorn is the best
You could have used Foxcrest as a basis for House Florent.
We do not smell

Let's be honest, Lannister deodorant probably smells the best
Where's Old Spice Tyrell?


I'd want to smell like a golden rose... with a hint of charred ashes.
I really enjoyed the survey and wall the final results were kindof disappointing I still really enjoyed doing the survey and I hope to see you do one similar to this one again
Honestly I think there's a decent chance the ice zombies just kill everyone. Yeah, that wouldn't be the best ending, but GRRM likes to be unexpected.

Plus I feel like there's more to Ramsay's line "if you think there will be a happy ending to this, you haven't been paying attention."
This is WAAAAAAAAAAAAY to idealistic. I'd say 25% tops actually happens, and that's being generous.
  Tyrion and Varys will be standing together on a balcony overlooking their enormous kingdom. They will talk about it, like it was a long plan that worked after all. The eunuch and the dwarf win in the end.
I'd love to see the Hound kill Gregor 
Night King shatters the iron throne with ice magic. The night king reveals himself to be Littlefinger.
Way to happy. I don't see half of this happening if GRRM has any say, which he will.
This feels like the logic that would make you think halfway through season 1 that Ned Stark will eventually be made King until he dies of old age and Robb peacefully takes over. Everything feels too fair and predictable to me. 
Too many happy endings there. I think that while they win the war against the Nights King and his army that almost everyone will die, except for Jon and/or Dany. Those who survive will likely be set in situations that are bittersweet, at best. 
Not really relevant to the main story but i read someone talking about how they'd like the very end to be a flashback to Ned and Robert in the Eyrie as children and them meeting, Robert being big and wild pushes timid Ned around. Eventually they get into a fight but Ned despite being significantly smaller puts up a brave fight and ends up hurting Robert. Robert looks like he's about to rage but then bursts out laughing and he embraces Ned for his bravery, Robert then says how he and Ned will someday be famous knights and have songs written about them and then side by side they run off down a hall laughing and playing. 

i thought it was sweet
I think i'd like to see arya and gendry get together. And i feel like Littlefinger is too smart to fail. The man is 10 steps ahead at all times.

Cataclysmically.
I'm pretty convinced Jon and Dany are dead when all is said and done.
These are mostly just the most popular/obvious theories. I'll be disappointed if the ending is essentially fanfic. I want the ending to be unexpected. 
>Arya and Brienne will both be anointed as the firsts female members of the King's Guard.

Niiiice
dany and jon will have a child (son of fire and ice) jon will have to kill her to stop the others. The others will be wiped out and jon will be asked to be king. He will refuse, Ending the power struggle. Jon will have to raise a child motherless.
Sorry about punctuation and grammar 
Book-wise, the WW conquer Westeros. All main characters die or become WW. While adjusting to new "life", main characters continue to fight for revenge, power or autonomy in the new WW kingdom of Westeros.
>Tywin was able to carry on as hand of the king, managing to unite the seven kingdoms and have them in the strongest possible position to withstand Dany, only to be out manoeuvred and defeated by Tyrion.

I think there is a very good reason that GRRM kills all the men or removes them from power and let's the war of the queens begin.
I think if anything he, at that moment, might actually just smirk before accepting defeat. If he saw Tyrion outwit him, Tywin fookin' Lannister, he'd be unable but to be impressed.

His death on the shitter is better imo because there is none of that 'well shit, gg Tyrion' and none of that acceptance that Tyrion is the closest one to him, it's just the dwarf who killed his wife coming to kill him while defenseless.

I prefer'd the toilet death, and Tywin is by far my favorite character. Just seems too dramatic and fantasy like for the story. For Tywin of all people to die like THAT to Tyrion also of all people, like you said has a ton of meaning. To extend it would only be good for me so we can have more Tywin love, but not better for story I don't think. 
The character of Tywinーparticularly though not only as realized by the amazing Charles Danceーis one of the most interesting, subtle, and complex characters in the series. Like many (Eddard, Jaime, Jorah, Selmy) as you read/watch you discover more and more about him that subtly alters how you see him. 

For this reason if nothing else I would have loved for him to live and have the scenario you describe play out.

Tywin as the Hand. Surviving Tyrion's use of Geoffrey's crossbow. First, he would have forced Cersei to marry Loras. Cersei would have been sent off to Highgarden under Ohlenna's watch. She would have been removed from the game, in that while she was still Queen Mother, she was no longer in King's Landing on a regular basis. Jaimie resigns from the King's Guard. Becomes Tywin's heir and returns to Casterly Rock. He gets married off to who? One of Frey's daughters? There's no females available from the Great Houses that remain. Majory marries Tommen and between her and Tywin, they shape Tommen to their needs. The Faith remains as it is, the Faith Militant banned and the High Sparrow never achieves the power he acquires before the destruction of the Sept of Bailor. Shae, though is dead and Tyrion is on his way with Varys to Danerys Stormborn. Qyburn is not allowed to build Frankenmountain. 
The storyline in the North remains the same up to the BoB, where Lannister troops off-set the Knights, but not enough to prevent Jon winning. So the Tywin faces a united North under the King in the North. He has to deploy Lannister troops to watch the North and secure the River Lands.
Littlefinger's and Sansa's arcs stay the same with LF murdering Lysa and becoming Lord Protector of the Vale and Sansa reuniting with Jon. The Hound and Brienne's arc stay the same.
The River Lands story line stays the same, with the Lannisters rescuing the Freys, Jaimie prying the Tullys out of Riverrun and Edmure back in the dungeon. Arya still kills Walder and his two sons. Tywin now faces uncertainty in the River Lands and has to once again send Jaimie and Lannister troops.
The Storm Lands are in chaos with the end of House Baratheon, so Tywin has to commit troops to secure order so that taxes can be collected and troops levied. 
The Reach is secured by the Tyrells, who provide the forces, led by Mace Tyrell, needed to face off against Dorne.
The Dorne storyline continues with Myrcella poisoned after Jaimie and Bran's rescue attempt, and Elleria Sand and the Sand Snakes taking control of an independent Dorne, which Tywin must deal with.
The Lannisters are broke and the King's government is deep in debt. Only the Tyrell's funding is servicing the debt and keeping the Iron Bank at arm's reach. Without the payments, the bank might buy mercenaries for Danerys or Jon to take the Iron Throne.
The Iron Island story line stays the same, with Yara and Theon stealing 100+ ships to join Danerys Stormborn and Euron building a new fleet and chasing after them. Euron's raiding the coast of the Reach and Dorne, sacking Oldtown, causes disruptions for both the Tyrells' and the Sand Snakes' plans.
Finally, Danerys Stormborn still sails with 8-9,000 Unsullied and 10-15,000 Dothraki. She is supported by the Sand Snakes and Dorne, but the Tyrells and the Reach are still loyal to the Throne. 
Tywin is good as a strategist and as a general and as a manager, but he just doesn't have the resources to deal with the Northern troubles and the return of the Starks, the "Blackfish" causing trouble in the River Lands, the Iron bank wanting its money, Euron raiding the western and southern coasts of Westeros, the chaos in the Storm Lands, the rebellion of Dorne and Danerys Stormborn returning to Westeros.
Have no idea of what that is supposed to be. Any picture of the original thing?

Piano cover of a piano song? Huh..
Not sure if you're asking whether Eyrie is impregnable, or if that climbing spikes thing would succeed.

If the first, then I'd say be Daenerys and land a goddamn dragon right up there. 

Second, then I don't think so.

*"The man who passes the pizza should eat a slice."*              


- Jon "The Kit" Snow, The King in the North, The Lord Commander of the Night's Watch and Heir to the Starks and the Targaryens via Ned Stark, The Warden of the North, a great father and the most noble man in all of Westeros. 
i am not envious at all, those people following these guys around from set to set screaming like little girls are really creepy. i would be extremely embarrassed to be that obsessed with actors, and then have that actor see how absurdly obsessed i was...i would be mortified.  

would much rather buy myself a pizza and eat it while watching the s7 premiere. 
Kinda cheesy, ;) ;o. But small stuff like that really hypes up the love for the cast and the show. Loved the look on The Hounds face xD
[PIZZA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJYDOBQE1U0)
He's so tiny
Damn Kit is tiny.
I legitimately get scared by fans who are obsessed with people like this. I love the characters and the stories but in the end people are just people. I'd have a huge grinn, but I wouldn't be screaming and reaching for them like these people. If I were on of those actors I'd be hiding away. Poor Kit.
["P'hysa! P'hysa!"](https://youtu.be/2Xv9Emwi1Cc?t=2m11s)
if anymore cheers come pouring out your fangirl mouth, i'm going to have to eat every fucking slice that's in that box
Seriously, pizza for the fans? Those guys couldn't be any more awesome!
What a dream it would be to be among a cast as amazing as that, they are all such wonderful, funny and thoughtful people.
At first, it looked like they were just going to bypass the people shouting at them and carry their pizza, on their way to wherever.  And who could blame them?  That shit day in and day out has to be rough at times.

But then they turned toward them and opened the pizza boxes and I was like "Damn... these guys are just class acts".
I love this cast!
Pizza is coming...
A few years ago I was on vacation in Kauai and I saw Peter Dinklage and his wife.  I was just standing outside in front of the lobby when I looked over and saw him.  I noticed the moment he realized I recognized him and it was almost like he was unsure of what I would do, like a wild rabbit just jumped out of a bush in front of him.  I simply gave him a head nod and he gave one back and proceeded into the lobby.  I'm not sure why he was at this particular hotel as there were a few nicer ones in the area but I'm at least 96% sure it was him.
Jesus, hold the fucking camera still
i they just showed them the pizzas, closed the boxes and walked away.
I always forget how short Kit is until he's standing next to David Benioff
What kind of potato-camera are they recording with?  Even older phones have better cameras than that. Current phones do quite well in low light. 
even better if the hound had kfc or chicken wings.
He's tiny!
Oh right...like I'm stupid enough to eat food gifted to me by Dan & Dave. Probably laced with the strangler.
Does anyone know where this is filmed at?
Thats pretty cool
got rubies on my damn chain
Well now I want pizza.
pizza brings people together. Even when you slap a fool for trying to steal an extra slice. 
No chicken pizza for the Hound, so he's cool with it.
I'm impressed they managed such a great video using a potato without a steadycam
funny, I don't see the actor who plays Hodor.  He must be eating pizza in his trailer.
It's funny how knowing is grabbing the pizza because they're all holding their phones to record. 
Where is this taking place?? I'm going to Iceland in January and thought it would be cool if they were filming there at that time. Since Winter is coming..yada yada yada!! 
Why would you post this? You know I can't stand the wailing of women
God, this would annoy me so much if I was one of them, having fans is probably great, nothing wrong with that, but the screaming would drive me insane. 
I am envious as well, it is not every day that your pizza is delivered by a potato.
I can't even tell what is happening. Was this filmed during an earthquake?
Yeah, free pizza is always good.
Hmmmm I thought Cersei ordered the rest of the feast to be eaten by the hounds? 
That would be fucking awesome!

Get pizza delivered to you by the cast and crew!

I think if I was to have anyone deliver a pizza to me, I'd want Jaime, the Hound, Ser Davos, Jon Snow and maybe Cersei.

I feel like the conversation would be amazing with them.
Pizza is coming.
Free pizza is awesome, but those people are really creepy. Because of these people I don't even want to see the location the show was filmed at. I'll travel elsewhere. 
Pizza pies…
"trae pizza" shit... they had to be Spanish, I have no idea why people of my country always try their best to embarrass us, well I guess there are crazy fans everywhere.
I forget how short Kit Harrington really is.
Why do they reward them with pizza while everyone knows that everyone hates it that they can't produce the show without spoiling stalkers?

the video is too jerky to see what the fucks going on or who even is bringing the pizza
He's just an actor. He says words that other people write. I don't understand the hero worship. 
Oh man, Kit is way shorter than I thought. Is everyone short in the show, or are they making him appear taller with perspective?
Catelyn is actually called Catelyn Stark most of the time. It seems that the Queen/Princesses of the Iron Throne don't adopt the King's surname (Elia, Margaery, Cersei) for whatever reason I don't know, but Ladies still adopt the surname when marrying members of a non-royal main house (Catelyn, Olenna)
People who marry with the members of the royal family, doesn't get the name of the royal family because they do not have the blood. That's why Cersei is never a Baratheon and Elia is never a Targaryen.

For the rest of westeros, almost always women get the name of their husbands. But if they come from prominent families themselves and are known for their persona, it is not uncommon for them to be still called by their maiden names by some people. House Tully is an important house as they are the lord paramount of Riverlands and Catelyn is known by Riverlords as the daughter of their liege lord Hoster Tully first and anything else second. That's why sometimes Walder Frey calls her Catelyn Tully. 


And then sometimes there is the case that women keep their maiden names and pass it onto their children. When their husbands are lowborn/unlegitimized bastards, or when the couple agrees to do it in an effort to make sure the woman's family name survives, or if the woman just has the much more prestigious name and man doesn't bother dropping his to give his children a better standing. Sometimes women are just in too high of a position then they can just outright have it a given that their name  gets passed down. This is how house Martell remained as Martell despite going through several female rulers.


Also, princesses of royal blood do not let go of their maiden names or take their husband's names. Rhaelle Targaryen didn't become Rhaelle Baratheon, Rhaenys Targaryen didn't become Rhaenys Velaryon, Rhaenyra Targaryen didn't become Rhaenyra Velaryon, Daella Targaryen didn't become Daella Aryyn, Elaena Targaryen didn't become Elaena Plumm/Penrose/Manwoody etc.

When a lord marries a lady, the lady takes the Lord's name. When two families conjoin to form the royal family. They keep their names, and the kids take both or either. 
She was the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, they get to keep the name of their House. That's why Joffrey was always introduced as being "of the Houses Baratheon and Lannister".
I think it is related to the power of the two families in question.  Lannister is the most powerful family in Westeros and so Cersei keeps her name and is never called Cersei Barratheon.  Tully and Stark are pretty evenly matched and so you sometimes hear Catelyn Tully. 
Another example is when they refer to Joffrey they say he is from the Houses of both Barratheon and Lannister, again highlighting the power of the Lannisters. 
I think they use our definition of a year, since everybody still ages and such, only their seasons are irregular because of magic
I think they do like we've done on earth for millennia, that is, define years by the revolutions of the stars rather than by seasons.
>[What is the cycle of a year? Why do they count years when seasons are strange?]

>GRRM: Twelve moon tuns to a year, as on earth. Even on our earth, years have nothing to do with the seasons, or with the cycles of the moon. A year is a measure of a solar cycle, of how long it takes the earth to make one complete revolution around the sun. The same is true for the world of Westeros. Seasons do not come into it.


My take on the 'seasons' is that they're like ice ages, or epochs. A year is still a year, although the climate is more moderate all year round, and every so often you get a 'winter', or a mini ice age, that lasts several years or even generations.
They'll also define a year as the time it takes for one revolution of the world around the sun, which you can determine by observing the sun's path across the sky, or the stars.

Of course the movement of the world around the sun, combined with the tilted axis of the rotation of the world is what *causes* seasons, but to assume that whatever makes the seasons so irregular on Planetos actually influences *those* is pretty preposterous, physically speaking (then of course, it's fiction).

Then there's two possiblities:

* Planetos's axis of rotation is not tilted. Normally that means it would not *have* seasons. Those it does have must therefore be due to some other mechanism, which doesn't need to be tied to orbital mechanics in any way and can therefore easily be irregular. The problem is that without a tilted axis, it becomes *much* harder to tell the length of a year - the sun will always have the same path across the sky, only the nearest stars will wobble a little bit. It's unlikely a medieval society would notice that and make it the basis of their common timekeeping.
* Planetos's axis is tilted and it would have normal seasons, but something else is able to *override* them partially. Not as crazy as changing orbital mechanics, but still impressive.

The most realistic explanation is probably that the axis tilt is less than Earth's, so normally the seasonal differences would be weaker than ours (and thus easier to override), but there would still be easily observable astronomical changes.

Year and seasons are independent from each other.

Year depends on time when planet turns around the star. Earth turns around the Sun in ~365.25 days. GoT planet may have a year even of 500 days (e.g. Martian year is far longer than solar year).

Season may depend on planet's tilt (like the case with Earth) or planet's orbit (e.g. not circular, but elliptical orbit where a planet approaches the star closer) or on other factors.

P.S. Why do you think Earth has four seasons? Maybe you live far away from equator and polar regions. In the poles there are 2 "seasons" - long night and long day, each taking half year. And the Earth's tilt makes little impact on Equator where it is all-year "summer" with Dry season and Rain season.


Position of the stars. One year is one revolution of the sun, but that doesn't mean that the axial tilt of the world of asoiaf is a constant due to some sort of magic, or what have you. GRRM has answered this question near a hundred times from fans wondering the same thing.
I remember reading a few years ago a theory that Planetos may orbit a star as part of a distant binary system, such that the secondary star was far enough away/dim enough to be little more than any other star in the night sky, but close enough to semi-randomly affect the orbit sufficiently to change the temperature by a degree or two, causing seasonal changes which take longer than a year. Probably completely impossible, but interesting.
Too bad this didn't make the cut, it's a great scene and gives the characters a more natural progression.
Shame. This is actually a great scene.
I believe they left it out, because it made Mace seem too stupid. But nonetheless, this scene could have added more depth to the King's Landing plot. It all seemed so short and sudden when the Tyrell family was mostly wiped out, they didn't even get a chance to show some resistance throughout the season.

GIS - Grow in Strength
https://youtu.be/ft7VNfWryxQ Because the video does not load on mobile.
don't know why this scene got chopped.

explains why oleanna was suddenly on the small council and further plays up how oblivious (but caring of his kin) mace is.

i can think of so many other scenes this past season that should've ended up on the editor's floor instead of this one.
I guess I'm the only one who is glad it was not in the show. I know Mace is supposed to be dim, but it made Olenna out to be patronizing. and it's fairly clear in the show already that Mace isn't the brightest bulb. this scene just needlessly rubs it in.

And it seemed like a needless "narration" scene where we the audience are told things that can be surmised simply by following the story. I mean it's pretty obvious what Cersei was doing. Maybe Mace was too dumb to see it, but the audience wasn't. So I think this scene sort of insults the intelligence of the audience and mostly tells us things we could figure out. I think the editors did us a service by cutting it.
This scene feels really unnatural and useless. They basically just repeat what we already know with some really boring dialogue. I prefer when scriptwriters leave some things unsaid and let us interpret what's happening on screen without using useless character exposition like this.
It really makes no sense why this was left out, surely a 1:15 scene that explains why she was on the council (something I had wondered about all season) wasn't too much to add in no?

It looks like she won't be leaving that city after all :(

Edit: Well...her family, anyway.
If only their plan had worked... :/
I like that scene, why did they take this out?
-Look me in the eye and tell me there was no signing

-... ¨shamefully looks at his feet¨

Haha great scene 
Well, to anyone that complained that no one talked about Braavos or Meryn Trant in S6: sometimes stuff ends up on the cutting room floor.
Not a fan at all of Mace Tyrell's acting. Very unnatural.
V

Tell me there was no singing

[startled]
Mace the Ace is a singer? MT=RT **Confirmed**
The Ace does love his singing
If you want to watch individual scenes, pretty much every scene in the whole series is on youtube in one way or another.
You should have recorded it and saved it while it was on. I've still got mine on the planner. I kept it so I could watch it again after the New Year when most of us are stuck indoors due to weather in the UK.

Take it you have SKY then ? If so it won't be long until Season 6 is shown again on SKY Atlantic as they are currently halfway through Season 5. It was being shown on a Wednesday, two episodes, starting at 9pm...for whatever reason they've moved as of last week to Friday and Saturday now(still 2 episodes a night). Season 5 episode 6 will air this week, so Season 6 will start next Friday so that'll be the best way to see it, probably over three weeks unless they fire the final two on during the Sunday night.

I've no idea why they sped up or moved the schedule...maybe to get things done before Christmas and maybe new programs coming. Remember to set your planner up to save... ;)

I like it better from a distance away rather than close up. Far away you really see the detail, dimension and depth.
Start by actually watching the rest of the show, if you're interested in more after that read the books, and if you're still interested in more after that there are tons of fan theories and other resources available on the web. 

I would estimate that the show captures roughly 40% of the story being told in the books and 150% of the nudity, which is simply the way it goes when converting something of that scale into bite sized episodes for a mainstream audience. The show is kind of like a cliff notes version of the books, hitting the same major story beats, but not necessarily taking the same path to get there. Also, there are literally hundreds of characters in the books and dozens of little subplots that are never referenced in the show that fill in a lot of the story. 

Some people prefer the show because of the cinematic treatment and simplification of the story to the point where you don't need to take notes, others prefer the books and the immense amount of detail and enjoy having the "full picture" of what's going on. I think they both have their merits and I know you said you don't want to read them, but if after you watch the show you're still wanting to figure out more of what's going on in the story you should take a look at the books. 
Start from the beginning and watch all seasons. This will get you up to speed. Also, the special lore videos on dvd/youtube/bluray are very good in explaining things.
Game of thrones is the type of show you can rewatch over and over and get something new out of it everytime (unlike walking dead where there is so much filler it's hard to get through one sitting). That's what makes the show so good.

When you rewatch for the second time it's almost like watching a different show because you know all the characters and can pickup on a lot more of the foreshadowing/smaller details.
Start at the beginning.  So much happens in every episode and every season you should just start where it started and work your way from there.

To help you out a little I have a story of my own.  I started with the show and almost lost interest around episode 3 because I just wasn't following everything that was happening.  Character names, locations, etc.  So I put the series down for like a month before deciding to actually take the plunge and catch up before season 2 started.

Here is what I did to help myself understand what was going on.  You will need a map and a genealogy guide so that if you ever have to question something, you have a handy guide right there.  I used it for almost all of season 1 and by the end of that season I was on doing well on my own finally.

[MAP OF WESTEROS](http://gameofthrones.net/images/Westeros_Maps/Map_Westeros_Political.gif)

Now this map only covers the eastern continent, but that is where the vast majority of characters are in the beginning.  This map shows you areas and even color codes them to which house rules them.  The only addendum to this I would say is that King's Landing and Dragonstone should be yellow with the stag.

[CHARACTER GENEALOGY](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2b-taalzHZY/U1LQD416D6I/AAAAAAAAADg/Xu3mcbzxGpY/w3780-h4050/IMG_0189.JPG)

If you ever need to know who anyone is, what family they are a part of, or who their relatives are, this guide will help you out.  It goes up through season 3, but by then I'm sure you should be well on your way to knowing who is who at that point.

I'd suggest you watch it all the way through, it's complicated but it shouldn't be too difficult to follow, if you're having difficulties understanding what's going on maybe watch a recap every time you finish a season.
Like everyone else here, I recommend starting from the beginning and then watching the rest of the seasons. Personally, I suggest that when you get to season 6 start watching Alt shift X's explained videos of each episode and some of his theory videos, if you're interested in those things of course.
What I did before watching season 5 and 6, looking up recaps of earlier seasons before watching. It'll put all the characters in place, even the ones you forgot about from season 1
If Cersei's claws could have been removed, he could have been an excellent king with those as his tutors.
He was too easily lead but if he had the right people leading him, he could have been a good king. His talk with Tywin about what a king is gave some indication that his heart was in the right place.

Had Margaery lived and ruled by his side with no interference from Cersei (as if) she (and Olenna) probably would have called all the shots while he stared at her in awe and longing, but they would have been more or less benevolent rulers. 
If Tywin had been alive long enough to explain to Tommen that as the king, he would have to use force in precarious situations, it could have made a huge difference.
Nobody had that talk with him, not even Cersei.
They tried to allude to the fact that he needed to take action against the faith militant, but he was never able to get past that barrier.
Had he learned to use violence when he needed to, he would have been a strong, yet fair king.
He was still young, but all indications are that he would have been a good, fair king. People say he was too weak, but I think he would have been perfectly capable of being strong and making tough decisions when he got older. It's just that he knew full well how violent and cruel Joffrey was, probably experienced some of it himself, and I feel like he was strongly driven by the desire to not be like that.

Tl:DR Tommen wasn't weak, just driven by desire to never be cruel/sadistic like Joffrey was.

He was a coward.
He wasnt strong enough to be a king...
It would have been amazing if he could switch places with Tywin. (King<-> Lord paramount of the westerlands). Tywin knew how to rule and  would have been a great follower. Besides it would be easier to get just the lords of the west to follow the son of a Lannister than all seven kingdoms
Doesn't "name day" mean birthday?  Why are they two separate dates?
IT'S BEAUTIFUL!
She's the keeper! 
That's actually very well done. Happy name day and upcoming birthday!
Happy Name day Ser Martin! 

May the gods keep you and your lady from this day til your last days. 
Shouldn't it be "seven and twenty"?
Happy Name day Ser Martin! 

May the gods keep you and your lady from this day til your last days. 
It was mine too! And on 18th it's my birthday! High five!

I thought this was pretty cool, the antlers sprouting from the lion must represent the fact that the Lannisters were never true Baratheons. There are three lions, and there were three Lannisters on Arya's list:

* Joffrey Baratheon (dead)

* Tywin Lannister (dead)

* Cersei Lannister

So I'm guessing the last lion is Cersei.
I really hope that it will be Arya who kills Cersei, in Jamie's face. So far Arya have only killed one important person on her list (and that was only in the show). Wouldn't make sense for her to have all that training to not use it for something.
There's a quote that Arya repeats to herself quite often in her own thoughts. I'm not sure who it stemmed from originally, though I believe it was her father. It goes something like "When the cold wind blows, the lone wolf dies and the pack survives" (I'm sure I'll get corrected on that). Arya often grumbles about it being the opposite and laments about how all of her "packs" ( the Stark house, gendry and hot pie, Dondarrion and co.) have left her in one fashion or another.  But to me, the list IS her pack. Whenever she falters, simply repeating the names renews her drive. Even though they don't support her physically, that group (or pack) is her motivation for being alive and helping her survive.
I'm not sure why but this picture immediately made me want to go fire up an old rpg. 
I'm not too keen on Arya being the one to kill Cersei... Yes, Cersei is on her list, but, personally, I don't see it happening.
This reminds me of the scene in the book where she is using a stick to practice on the leaves of the trees (I think that she was in the Godswood of Harrenhall), and she pretends that each leaf is another person on her list.

Yo this is a mad good
That looks great!
 … dragon deaths.


I had a simple idea a while ago that all of the dragons will suffer a fate similar to their namesake. In short, Rhaegal, like Rhaegar, will die in one-on-one battle with an enemy.  Viserion will threaten Dany just as Viserys did, forcing Drogon to kill him. And most tellingly, Dany will have to kill Drogon in a bittersweet twist.  The more I mulled it over it seemed to fit and at the very least it is fun to guess how the foreshadowing will play out.


Looking back at Rhaegar, he had an epic battle with Robert in the Trident's raging rivers.  He ultimately succumbed to a warhammer blow that caused the rubies to fly off his chestplate like drops of blood.  Likewise, I believe Rhaegal will take a blow that will quite literally knock the scales off his chest. He may also drown in a direct battle with a kraken (or another dragon) just as Rhaegar ended up in the water. Another possibility is death by a “trident” spear since we still have a crossbow making the rounds in King's Landing.  Rhaegal is admittedly the hardest one to guess as the story is still so open.


Next up are Viserys and Viserion, who had a lot in common -- they both spent their early years begging and travelling with a sibling. Viserys' threats to Dany eventually escalated until Rakharo defended her with a whip, Dany defended herself with a belt of "bronze" medallions, and finally the Dothraki held Viserys down while Drogo gave him a bloodless death.


I think this foreshadows Viserion being warg-controlled to the point where he attacks Dany. Even though he is cream colored, he is often referred to as the “white” dragon so it shouldn't be a surprise.  The first time he attacks, Dany might use her “bronze” Dothraki to defend herself, but Drogon will eventually need to FINISH HIM. On the show, the bloodriders hold Viserys down and break his arm. Perhaps the Dothraki will break one of Viserion's wings, making it easier to hold him so Drogon can go in for the final kill. Another possibility is that Euron may use the dragon-binding horn on the open sea and Viserion could attack Dany there.  Viserion might then be “weighed down” somehow like the pot of gold on Viserys head and drowned in a bloodless death.


The easiest comparison though is Drogo and Drogon. I believe Drogo's story not only foreshadows Drogon's death, it reveals that Dany will be the warrior that forges Lightbringer by stabbing Drogon in the chest.


Looking at Drogo, he campaigned for Dany to the point where he was injured right over his HEART. He could no longer ride, was no longer himself and Dany mercy-killed him.  Likewise, I believe Drogon will be injured in battle to the point where he can no longer fly. A dragon not being able to fly would be very similar to a Dothraki  who cannot ride a horse.  Alternatively, Drogon may also not be himself from warging.  Either way, just like Drogo's mercy killing, Dany will have to kill Drogon with a sword to the heart. He might even be smarter than we expect and bare his chest to her willingly like Nissa Nissa. In that legend, Lightbringer stabs his loved one and her cry left a crack in the face of the moon. Killing Drogon would certainly hurt Dany, the “Moon” of Khal's Life.


The Azor Ahai legend supports this. It states that, “a WARRIOR shall draw from the fire a burning sword. And that sword shall be Lightbringer… the RED Sword of Heroes...” Dany is increasingly portrayed as the chief Dothraki “warrior.” Last season Daario even goes out of his way to call her not a princess but a conqueror.  Regarding the sword coming out red, Drogon is the only dragon with that color -- "smouldering red pits" for eyes as well as red horns, spine and fire.  Finally, if you watch closely on the show, Drogon's red scales look more and more like an internal “fire.” The original Lightbringer failed to forge a sword with water and a lion, so it would make sense that the greatest forge of all is a dragon.


For the record, I don't necessarily think that Dany is Azor Ahai because of all this. I think she will forge the sword and be Lightbringer, and Jon will be Azor Ahai and wield it in a battle with the Night King.  I appreciate that this is all speculation, but if the first dragon death does end up mirroring its namesake, it means we can look to these earlier character deaths (Rhaegar, Viserys and Drogo) for ideas on how the dragons' stories, and the main story, will end.


Edited to add one last thought:  I re-watched the final scenes with Drogo to see if I missed anything and something did stand out to me.  Even before Drogo dies, Jorah was warning Dany that they needed to flee quickly because Drogo was the source of her power and protection.  She was in real danger once the khalasar realized he was dead and in fact 99% of them did abandon her the next day.  As far as DrogoN goes, I always pictured him dying at the very end, once Dany's position was secure.  But what if he died a bit earlier?  Just like with Drogo, Dany would be losing the source of her physical strength, power and influence.  I like to think that by the end of the series, we will see the groundwork for an almost identical scene, only this time it will play out differently.  Dany's entourage will see that Drogon is gone but now her "khalasar" will remain loyal to HER.  This would be a beautiful, symbolic difference and I hope the show has time to give it deference.

This slick son of a bitch just got away with link and comment karma, and I'm not even mad.
This was so well thought out I'm already sad like it happened.  With no Ygritte, Drogo, or Daario left for Jon or Dany to kill, I've often wondered who the Nissa Nissa would be for Lightbringer.  Drogon makes a lot of sense since we know how much Dany loves her dragons.  The only hiccup I see is that Dany doesn't carry a sword. In the heat of battle if Drogon goes down, I can see her shouting for a sword and some random soldier hands his over.  I can't see just any old sword becoming Lightbringer...so we would have to see her obtain a sword of significance soon.  If this happens I'll probably curse out loud, and it will be directed at you.
Great theory, I needed a good read during my lunch break.
Would be cool if Rhaegal gets turned into an Ice Dragon and then eventually becomes Jon's Dragon. Yeah I know it's fanfiction, but it would awesome for Jon to have an ice dragon that roams around the North or at least stays close to Winterfell. 
Sudden thought, how the fuck does Drogo lie down with a ponytail? Gaping plothole /s
I love this theory, and I especially love the idea of the undead dragon.  Holy fuck, would that be a great visual of it rising from the dead.  I have to wonder then, is the final battle between the Night King and Azor Ahai (whomever it may be) going to be in the skies, with dragons?!  
Where's the theory? I just see a picture of drogo dying?
Man I really don't want the dragons to die :(
My one and only theory is that the White Walkers built the wall to protect themselves from Lyanna Mormont.

Definitely. Spot on. 
A problem I see with the theory is that the purpose of plunging the sword into water, the lion, or Nissa Nissa was to quench it, not forge it. The sword had already been forged at that time. Quenching means to rapidly cool the metal by immersion in a liquid in order to harden it. Dragons are "fire made flesh," so would Drogon's blood even be capable of quenching?
Very interesting. Awesome offseason read.
Honestly this theory makes so much sense and would wrap up so many loose ends that I could see GoT writers working on the script in a conference room somewhere saying "shit, Reddit guessed it guys"
But... I don't want them to die :(
Amazing theory!
If i am not mistaken the upcoming season is the last one right? I dont see how they can sum up everything nicely without it feeling rushed.
Well, you sold me. I'm fully on board with this theory now!
First I got upset Bc I don't want Drogon to die, I fucking love that bad ass dragon. Then I got really upset because this is GoT & everything/everyone we get attached to dies. 
Wow that's an amazing theory!
Damn Emilia Clarke looks amazing in that photo.
It's been years since the last quality post...
Gendry smashing rhaegals chest!!!! 
Isn't Rhaegal named after her and Drogo's kid in the show though?

Man... whenever I suggest my theory about the direwolves, nobody wants to hear it. Even when there's plenty of evidence to support it.

Edit: See?
This is a pretty great theory. It will probably be in the books but not in the show because the show has chosen to forego interesting writing...
Doesn't matter, we all know aegon is the next true king of westeros
I would say dragon as well. You could also do a mermaid for House Manderly/second Triwizard task.
Dragon for sure.  Even the Hogwarts motto is "never tickle a sleeping dragon."  You could have the motto in Latin (as it is on the Hogwarts sigil) underneath a sleeping Drogon. Edited to add:  An angry-looking, "Did you just wake me up?!" Drogon could work too.
The first things that come to mind are:
dragon for the triwizard tournament, and other things and house targareyan (spelling?)
Squid for the giant squid in the lake next to hogwarts, and house greyjoy
A tree for the hearttree and the whomping willow

Damn.. someone with dedication. Maybe something with a dragon, they were in Harry Potter 4. If I come up with something I'll contact again

Maybe this link will help you in inspiration

EDIT: could you post a picture of your sleeve? I'm curious about it now
Maybe next season, when the "Giant ice spiders" come, you'll have something new to tattoo
a ghostly shape that could pass for a dementor and for a WW?
A portrait of Anne Boleyn? Bear with me, it was in the Harry Potter movie for like a glimpse (she was rumored to be a witch) as like a former student, and Natalie Dormer played her on the Tudors.  I'm over reaching I know lol.

Get a dragon for House Targaryen/Any dragon from the series.
There is also a Greyjoy kraken residing in the Hogwarts Lake.  It's a friendly squid who pushes a student out of the water when one falls in.  You could also work in a sword mashup of Godric's sword with whichever one you like from Thrones.
You could also throw in an ice spider somewhere, though that's not exactly my favorite thing to visualize
A long sword


It will be a tribute to Gryffindor sword and Ice
You can also draw a dragon and write 'Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus' near it.. it's the Hogwarts motto.. never tickle a sleeping dragon
Sword of gryffindor and long claw
Ravenclaws lost diadem and Cersei's crown 
Voldemort and the Night King

A serpentine dragon entwined around a broadsword 
Add a spear to the snake and you have the Martels
Ravenclaw is an Eagle...
You should change the flair to [Nothing]...

Pretty sure they did futuristic Jon Snow in Infinite Warfare. 
This is clearly a ZOIDs crossover.
I like it but ghost needs red eyes.
John snow confirmed leader of the terran rebellion in starcraft 3. 
Gives off Mass Effect vibes for me.
I see you with that Liger 0 next to roboJon!
His head looks so small lol
All that steel would get soooo cold up on the wall!
Space shire 7!
GOT 20x6!
I think he could use a pulse rifle with a wolf's head suppressor. Works because ghost doesn't make noise.
But what does futuristic Longclaw look like? 
Jon Stark confirmed? Oh, wrong Stark...
r/callofduty
Jon Snowpiercer?....sorry
You know a huge amount Jon Snow,...cause you know,... the cerebral implants and shit.
Is this the real Ghost in the Shell?
Excellent... until you notice the enormous robot legs lol.  Reminds me of Grandma's Boy.  BzZzt bRrrP "Later turd nuggets!"
Foreshadowing Tony Stark. I presume.
Is this an Iron Man/Mega Man crossover?
I hate this
That's cool
WHAT?!?!?! Damn 
Looks about right!
Iron snow
Reminds me of Matt from Digimon with metalgarurumon.
At first glance, from the thumbnail, thought it was just Kylo Ren.
[They both got great hair and robo wolves.](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/59300/4234449-0523963082-Raiden.jpeg)
iron man with a cape lol
As Darth Vader showed us, even in the future, capes are always in style. 
Tony Starks nephew. IRON BASTARD.
So is this the scene where he's on Europa? 
Looks like kylo ren all grown up.

Agree with this interpretation. Jon seems to be PtwP if the whole "Promise me, Ned" and subtle foreshadowing with bloody Dawn (forged from a fallen star) and all that counts.
I actually kinda agree. She did literally kill drogo by  putting that pillow over his face and because of this sacrfice she got her dragons. She may never of gotton them if drogo never died. 
Heres the thing we already know the prophecy has been misinterpreted.Maester aemon says its gender neutral,meaning it could be the princess or prince.I personally believe that it means 2 people rather then one.As in both dany and Jon.

If you read the books you will know that 3 is the most significant number in them.3 dragons,dany and jon are both there fathers 3rd child.And in her prohecys there is alot of 3 treasons you will know etc.But there is a part that says "three fires must you light... one for life and one for death and one to love... three mounts must you ride... one to bed and one to dread and one to love... three treasons will you know... once for blood and once for gold and once for love..."

My personal take is that one for life is for the dragons,one for death is the khals and the one to love will require both dany and jon and perhaps he pulls her out of a fire,as she isnt suppoused to be fireproof and thats pull a flaming sword from the flames, Lightbringer, to combat the coming darkness
So the dragons are Lightbringer and there wont be a sword?
Let's look at the clues:

1. The series is called A Song Of Ice And Fire. 
2. It is generally agreed that Jon is Ice and Dany is Fire (physical representations of). 
3. Azor Ahai and The Prince That Was Promised are not necessarily the same thing. 
4. Jon was born to a 'promise' that Ned made to Lyanna Stark. So, TPTWP...?
5. Like you say, Dany finished Drogo and was born again through the fire bearing 3 Dragons. So, AA...?

The Dragon has 3 heads; Jon, Dany and...? Remains to be seen / confirmed IMO. A lot of people believe it to be Tyrion. That kinda makes sense, since he's a 'main' character and represents another 'major' house of Westeros. Stark, Targaryan and Lannister. It could also be Jaime. 

I mean, that's what all the non-Melisandre red priests think =P
She wasn't born under a bleeding star. She's "stormborm".

Tbh it sounds more like your roommate is lying about being unfamiliar with Game of Thrones to look cool for you.
sounds like he's fucking with you
And there's no chance he's read the books, or any of the blogs?
Yea he already knew.
I think you're roommate is just looking up major spoilers b fore they happen.
Maybe he's reading spoilers ON THE TOILET?!
Yes he has totally been watching the youtubes or read the books.Was the olenna thing even hinted at in the show? 
He knew.
I love when you somehow predict something while joking, In the beginning of Witcher 2, I was joking that the priest was a witcher too w/my friends when He actually turned out to be Letho.

But guessing something like Tywin's death is a little too unbelievable
wow, let us know his reaction when he watches that episode!

It's only believeable if your friend's name is "Jon" coz...
Tormund said it best...
"We're not clever like you southerners... when we say we are going to do something, we do it."
Honor comes before personal gain for people of the north. 

THE NORTH REMEMBERS!!
Because they're too honorable (Catelyn, a Tully, being in the family may also have helped) and sometimes too passionate

- Rickard and Brandon went see the Mad King to protest Rhaegar abducting Lyanna, knowing fully well he was mad
- Ned refuses to play the game and even warns Cersei to leave King's Landing, not imagining that she would retaliate
- Robb marries for love instead and breaks a negotiated political marriage
- Jon hopes for peace between 2 longstanding bitter rival factions despite the status quo
- Bran climbs when told not to and goes greenseeing by himself when told not to
- Rickon doesn't zigzag
- We haven't seen much blunders out of Benjen to properly judge him
Are they?  The Stark traditions of loyalty and honor aren't meant to benefit individuals, they're meant to benefit the clan as a whole and the North as well.  Of the legendary great houses, I believe they're the only ones who have survived (I don't remember my history of Dorne too clearly, so someone correct me if I'm wrong there).  Yes, there are times of turmoil and struggle, but the line endures.  Why?  Because the North knows that the Starks mean justice, stability and protection, all highly useful during the North's harsh winters.

Now look at the major game players and their house situations.  The Lannisters are likely to fall to in-fighting without Tywin, who was murdered by his own son.  The Baratheons turned against each other and in the show (perhaps soon the books as well) are now extinct in the main line.  The Martells are fighting each other and/or have fallen to a coup.  The Tully strength seems to have started to collapse after Hoster's death, Cat's dead, Lysa's crazy (and dead) and Edmure has been chillin' in a dungeon for quite a while.  Robin Arryn's been raised to be selfish and cowardly and now the Vale is pretty much ruled by Littlefinger.

The Tyrells, interestingly, were the one family that at least showed consistent loyalty to each other and made attempts to serve the people (whether or not it was for appearances, they still did).  If it weren't for Mace and Margaery's ambitions, they'd never have gotten entangled with Cersei and probably wouldn't be in the situation they're in.

Compare that to the Starks.  Yes, they're weak now, but there are at least seeds of future greatness.  The family is unified (ignoring speculation about Sansa next season; if Sansa turns, Sansa dies), they are beloved by their vassals, and they are the ones who are probably going to lead the fight against the White Walkers because they know their duty.

Ned and Robb aren't actually that important in the greater scheme of things, and they know that.  That's what honor is about: doing your best to preserve society by being trustworthy and showing the virtues you represent.
They aren't fools. They come from a different world than the South. In the south, backstabbing, underhanded intrigues are the norm. The nobles live by the game, always on the pursuit of some kind of gain. In the North, things are too rough and too cold for the houses to play games. They understand the dangers from the Wall and the wildlings. They live their lives to survive and provide, not play the game and have fun.
But it's true, the Starks do LOOK like fools when they are out of their element. Ned was an honorable man, too honorable for Kings Landing and the court. And that's what got him killed. Robb was a young man in love with a pretty girl. What he did was pretty foolish, but Rikkon was just a boy running for his life. Yeah, it would have been smart to zigzag, but I would have ran straight if I was running away from a mad man scared out of my wits. And Jon is doing pretty well for himself I say. The wildlings and northerners have a very uneasy peace going, but it's amazing Jon was able to accomplish that much, considering that the two groups have hated each other for basically forever.
Ned Stark gave up his honor for his kids and was still betrayed. By blood sucking inbred politicians.

'It is better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all'.
When you play the game, you win or you die. It's that simple. 
I don’t consider them fools. I think they want to to do good, do justice, but fail to understand people that think differently than them. 

Ned lost the game of thrones because he didn't tried convincing people that helping him would have further their personal agenda, instead he tried to get people to put aside their agendas and do the right thing. But Ned isn’t a good guy because of his rigorous rule following, but because he is capable of putting other people’s well being before his own image (Lyanna and Jon, Catelyn, Cersei and her children, Sansa). What eventually gets him killed is that he does this with Cersei, but fails to understand how her mind works.

Both Robb and Jon try to embody Ned’s teachings. Neither of them sought the power they got (Sam plotted to get Jon elected LC and Robb’s bannermen declared him KitN) but they both quickly step into the role and set out to be a ruler like Ned. Both of them start to distance themselves from their friends/family in order to be the leader they think they have to, and people around them don’t always understand their mindset. Robb dismisses Catelyn’s and some of his bannermen’s opinions, and Jon his brother’s. They trust that people who have reasons (honourable or not) to be disloyal to them will be loyal anyway (Theon and Robb's bannermen, Bowen March and Jon's brothers) and they both completely fail to anticipate what came to befall them (the Karstarks, Boltons, and Freys leave Robb’s cause, and the brothers of the Night’s Watch betray Jon). 
Most Stark children are alive , Lannister children all dead  - does this hold any significance? , that is because they are respected and the country collectively looks out for the Stark children. Rickon's death is unfortunate which would have left Robb as the only Stark child dead , and he somewhat brought it upon himself as a man not a child. The way I see it this is because the Starks are a good example to the kingdom and people honour them. I always perceived this to be karma in the GOT world

Is it just the men tho or is it just Starks in general that are fools. I mean don't get me started on Cat and Sansa.
What is it littlefinger says in s1, something like "starks - soft of heart strong of head". I think it's just how they are. Honorable and headstrong but not so great at plotting and intrigue.
Honour 
Northerners are too honorable, especially the Starks. It's why people admire them, but the whole story revolves around showing how almost always, honor seems to lose. Too much trust, and good hearted thinking, hoping people wouldn't actually do what they do. I think though Ned for example knows people are shit, and he's seen it with his own eyes, but is ignorant to it on purpose, for the good of everything.
> I think they know just enough to not get killed if not win the game

Ned, Robb, and Rickon all bastards confirmed.
I agree on the Jon and Dany marriage but I believe that Jon will die in battle immediately after dealing the final blow to the WW and Dany will die in childbirth. Thus making it bitter by way of having both Jon and Dany die, but sweet because the offspring will go on to rule eventually thus re-establishing the Targaryen line.
Yeah Jon is definitely gonna plunge his sword into Dany, and their child will be LightBringer. 
There's enough evidence to suggest dany is also azor ahai. I believe she is azor ahai while jon is the prince who was promised. 
Its a prophecy it isnt meant to be literal plus its being translated from different languages.

The prince who was promised is meant to be reborn admist smoke and salt,if it was literal that would make him a ham.

Also if you read the books you will know that when berric is resurrected he gains the ability to run his blood along a sword and his blood is made of fire and thats how his swords go on fire.So jon wouldnt need to kill dany to have a flaming sword.
Jorah Mormont is Azor Ahai. Dany marries Jorah. He'd be dead as fuck by now and not given so many cool scenes and lines in the TV show if he didn't have a big part to play at the end.

I'm pretty sure this is the most popular theory floating around this offseason.  Those who don't buy into it think it's too obvious.
Danerys Stormborn will not sit on the Iron Throne, she will die and die north of the Wall, rejoining her beloved Drogo and their son in death. Thus the vision becomes reality.
What do you make of the Dany killing Drogon theory posted here recently? That seems much more like GRRMs sort of style imo 
[deleted]
You do realise that in your lists of people each character has killed, Jon has the longest. Right?
Because Tyrion and Daenerys have never killed people fairly in single combat, but were done through proxies or when the others were unarmed
Just accept it OP. You're way off the mark
Sorry, but Jon's first kill was the wight that was breaking into Mormont's quarters at the wall.
Didn't Jon kill like 18 people during BotB alone?
The best point you bring up is that he has to kill a brother for his first kill. Considering all the speculation of him being AA and needing to kill someone he loves to get lightbringer or whatever the sword is im a little high fuzzy on names lol
Except Dany and Tyrion rarely kill people with their own hands. There's a huge difference in commanding someone to die and doing the deed directly. Jon is always on the front lines when shit breaks out. That's why his men respect him so much. He wouldn't command them to do anything that he wouldn't do himself. He's also a lot more mature when it comes to killing than Dany. While Jon is more than willing to kill if he has to, he also realizes that taking someone's life is not a joke. He's not even proud of his kill count. We saw this in season 6 when he was ranting about how tired he was of fighting and how much all the lives he took weighed on him. Tyrion understands this as well. Considering that Dany's natural response to antagonism is to light them on fire, her not so much. And that's because Dany has never had to pick up a sword and defend herself in a life or death situation. it's easy to feel detached from killing when you're not the one actually doing the deed. Out of the three, Jon is the only true warrior amongst them. 
Jon may have killed the least *important* characters, but I'd argue that he has overall the most kills.
Dany is hardly a diplomat, she's a conquerer.

I like Season 6 one better for some reason. Feels more... Kingly.
Season 5 NK was much better.
When I first watched S6, I honestly thought it was a different character.  Same with Daario - took me about half an hour to finally realize they re-cast him.
he's to blame for hold the door :(
I like Vlads.
S6 looks a lot more like Voldemort
Vladimir Furdik was also a sword fight stunt in the Tower of Joy scene.
I like Richard Brake's eyes more, but other than that, they're both good.
Practical FX adds a palpable feel that makes it "real". Waay way too many movies now don't have that, and so much is CGI. You lose an important realism with the character.
S6 kinda looks like Bran to me. Facial dtructure wise. 
What an unfortunate last name

[removed]
Dick Brake and Vladimir Furdik. 
And Season 4 lol: http://www.magazine-hd.com/apps/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/468px-Nights_king.jpg
The first one looks like he is about to start shredding some epic black metal song, the second one looks like frozen Daniel Craig.
I prefer the Season 5 version, especially after seeing Richard Brake in 31.
I didn't even realize they were different! I think I prefer S6.
Season 5 looks more like someone who is the king of the undead. Season 6 looks more royal in his facial structure and expression, the same way that season 5 looks more bony and like a corpses. Regarding the CGI aspect, I agree season 6 looks more realistic but it could also be the background and shadows.
Probably not.  We know how Ned feels about killing children, from his arguments with Robert over the Targaryen kids.
No. Theon would never have even been in Winterfell if it weren't for the Greyjoy rebellion. Plus Ned would never kill a child for the sins for the child's father (remember his fights with Robert regarding Dany in book/season 1?)
Definitely, I don't know why people are saying no. Ned is an honorable man, and honour works both ways. That's the point of taking wards. Did Ned pardon the deserter in s1e1? Not at all, he did his duty. Just as it would have been his duty to punish Balon by executing Theon should the iron islands rise again. By not executing Theon he would have undermined the whole ward system of Westeros and given way for many more rebellions. I have no doubt Ned would execute Theon. He would take no joy in it at all, and I imagine it would have a major effect on him, but I still think he would do it. 

Besides, even if he didn't want to, Robert would've commanded him to, and we all know he would agree to the king's command. 

Although having said that, he did storm out of the small council meeting and quit as Hand because Robert wanted to assassinate a child (Dany). I still think that this is a different scenario though. Theon is a hostage for the sole. purpose of stopping rebellion. Dany is a child with an unfortunate surname on the other side of the world. 


Instead of executing theon they smash the iron islands again and make theon the new lord of the iron islands 
nope, Ned risk a lot for his honor, like when he risk his life after giving Cersei time to move before telling Robert about the Lannister sibling's incestuous relationship which eventually led to his death.
If Balon had rebelled *a second time* then it would have certinly put Ned in an awkward position. He certainly wouldn't have killed Theon, and I think he might have been reticent to even imprison him were he still a child at the time of this hypothetical second rebellion. Likely Theon would have been whisked away somewhere, out of reach of both Balon and Robert Baratheon.
I think that he would've attacked the Iron Islands and killed Balon, after which he would have control over the only heir of the Iron Islands.  
Ned is a honourable man. He wouldn't of executed Theon.
I highly doubt it. The rebellion would have been fairly easily crushed (again), and Ned was so determined to have Theon grow up to not become what his father and other ancestors were because he knew Theon was the heir to the Iron Islands. He wanted Theon to rule the Iron Islands one day, and be a different sort of ruler; the kind that wouldn't constantly be a problem. I don't think he would have thrown all that away over a rebellion that would not have been too difficult to stop anyway. 
I don't think the point of having Theon as a hostage was to execute him if Balon rebelled again - it was insurance to ensure a tame heir to the Iron Islands in the event Balon did rebel again and the Iron Islands leadership was exterminated in retaliation.
Not Ned. Most likely Robert will be the one.
In the books theon talks about how big and scary Ice is and how he doesn't like carrying around for Ned because he knows that if his father doesnt behave Lord Eddard would do his duty. Whether Ned actually would is a different story. But ned definitely wanted theon to know it was a possibility. 
It was the honorable thing to do. Balon had broken his word. Theon was a hostage to his word. Balon must have believed that Ned would execute Theon, otherwise he would not have kept the peace.

Theon's no child.  He's a man grown.  He would have been killed by Ned's own hand.
Nope.
New art style is pretty dope.
And these is going to be 17 more like this at november 15? Can't wait.
Hope it all gets up on youtube :D

No Lyanna Mormont(Bella Ramsey)?, i'm disappointed!!

Though i can't wait to her "House Dayne: narrated by Young Ned Stark (Robert Aramayo)".
This looks like a digital painting to me. Probably just some fan art. Hilarious either way.

I thought it was pretty obvious the first time around, its not like Luwin whispered it. He kinda said it right to his face when he was the only one talking. It was pretty clever of him though. 
That's a kick right in the nads....oh wait

I wish they were actual sweaters instead of sweatshirts. Sweaters>>>
Is there a house clegane? I need to get myself inspired for the next time I eat every fucking chicken in this room 
Some of these got posted on this sub last year around this time, but I ended up missing out. I didn't want to do the same this year and figured this sub might appreciate it as well.

Picked up Mannis for me and Targaryen for the wife.

Link for the interested: http://www.onceuponatee.net
TBH, the first one I read after zooming in was "we do not sow" and I thought it said was "we do not snow." And I was like, "ah they're all Christmas puns." Then I read the stark one and thought that there isn't really much you can do with that one. Then I read the other and realized that they aren't puns and I'm just bad at reading text on sweaters.
Anyone ever notice that house greyjoy's "kraken" symbol looks like a uterus? Accompanied by the slogan "we do not sow" ... like reproduce? 
Man, these are cool. I want them ALL
How's the sizing on these?  True to size or do they run large/small?
growing strong. lol.
anybody know what the print quality is like? I have never ordered from them.
White Walker is definite fav.
I threw my wallet at my monitor but nothing happened

WTF do I have to do to get a damn boat with an onion on its sail on a piece of merchandise? This is getting ridiculous.
Who in the fuck would get a Bolton sweater 
The Seaworth sweater is just a plain old cable knit turtle neck.
What a great find! Just bought Stark and Targ sweatshirts!!

Can't wait to wear them 
Bought me and my girlfriend Stark and Targ ones respectively for Christmas. Went with the tshirt print instead of sweatshirt and loved them. Wear them every Sunday during the season
Anywhere I can find these without the slogans? 
It's possible to get a 10% discount as well if you're tight for money. Code is Welcome10.
Where's House Cleganebowl??
Thanks for this!
Oh man, I kind of really want one. I wish there was a variant for Jon Snow's White Wolf banner, that'd be cool.
I want the House Stark one.
Bought the Stark one for my husband for Christmas! I'm in Canada though so I hope it gets here in time. I know he'll love it (and I'll be stealing it).
where can I buy those?
I actually still don't have a Christmas sweater.. my family wouldn't get at all what I was wearing, so I could secretly feel cool on the inside haha
Just bought fire and blood sweatshirt
Gah!! I need them all!
Oooooh yeah!! I got 4 for me and my friends! Stark, nights watch, greyjoy, and of course Baratheon for yours truly. OURS IS THE JOLLY!!!!
Shut up and take my money!

I just bought one of these too https://teespring.com/drink-know-things-black


I got the House Stark sweatshirt and it was really warm, too warm that I had to take it of inside the house.
I bought the House Baratheon one last year. Decent quality.
Sweet. Just snagged a House Baratheon sweatshirt.
I WANT IT
This year's is "ho-ho-hodor"
I found the Greyjoy one at Goodwill a few weeks ago.
Just got the house of black and white sweatshirt!!!
I'd get either the House Stark or House Targaryen one.
So all these are avaiable only 2 days forward? or is that only some of the designs that will disappear?
I got a different one for all of my family members last year. They're awesome.
From thumbnail:

Another assassins guild that's only active in The Long Night: The Sweaterless Men. 
House baratheon sweatshirt purchased last year. Love it. 
For a second I definitely thought this was going to be a GoT-themed advent calendar
remember these aren't sweaters. they are basically long sleeve shirts
Oh shit! I thought, from the thumbnail, that this would be an advent calendar using the Many Faces for each day. That would be tight, I think.
Great find! Just ordered the nights watch one. 
Where is the link to the site where I can gift these to people at no charge? How do I contribute if I can't afford the price tag? Even if I don't need one myself, why am I still restricted from expressing such a meaningful gift to a stranger soul? You can put a 'Reddit Silver' sticker on it, if that's a reasonable compromise. It's still something to cherish.
Missed out on what? On the karma?
$56 shipping to Norway? Shit
No mockingbird?

And why is it the only House Baelish shirts I can find are green instead of black on yellow?
"House ClegNe: "We always hype."
Those are sick! 
Seems like they're no longer available at onceuponatee, a lot of stranger things and dr. Who stuff now. Any other place to buy them? Found this but not sure the website is good: https://www.mpcteehouse.com/product/game-of-thrones-we-do-not-sow-ugly-sweater/
They seemed to have removed them from their shipping schedule. Anyone have any info on this?
Thanks for reminding me. I got one last year that has Santa Claus on an iron throne of candy canes!
Congratulations...You are the first person to post a Christmas related post. You were earlier than Marketers for commercials and in-store items.

...I hate you.
"Hear me Roar?" Wtf?
Something like 30% of that content should be from the Hound's "every chicken in this room" scene. 
All that and I didn't get to hear Yara say they she was going to "Fuck the tits off that one."?

It really shows how poor the writing has become that 99% of these come from pre-season 6 and the stuff that does come from season 6 aren't even really great lines.  They just don't have the same out of context meaning that a lot of the other lines do.  "Don't forget what you are, No one else will.  Wear it like armor" vs "I drink and I know things".

Great!! Now i just need Kit's hair.
Damn, I'm really pleasantly surprised about this, I never did check out *Harry Potter agus an Órchloch* but I love the idea, going to get it.

Seán an tSneachta is pretty awkward for Jon Snow but I like a lot of the translations. The "corónach" in the title actually refers to crowns rather than thrones, probably because the Irish word for throne "ríchathaoir" (king-chair) is kind of clunky.

Soirse and Séimí are Irish names, not particularly common but good renderings of Cersei and Jaime. I also like Séafra for Joffrey. For Theon, "Diagán" comes from "diaga" which means holy/sacred, so it's a good way to evoke the same reaction as the Greek name. The Hound being "An Cú" heavily evokes the Irish mythological hero Cú Chulainn.

"Seo chugainn an geimhreadh" means "Winter is coming" in case it isn't clear from Winterfell being "Geimhsceird."

I'm really liking the depth that went into this translation (certainly glad they didn't go for stuff like "Westerós" instead of "Iartharas," which I love the sound of), curious as to how they render some of the other names. Some like Aemon (Éamonn) and Aegon (Aodhgán) have pretty direct translations, but others would be tricky.

Edit: Disregard the start, an interview deals with the "Seán an tSneachta" thing pretty thoroughly.

Too bitter, not enough sweet.
I think this would be more satisfying than Daenarys sat on the throne at the end because that's insultingly predictable but no, this would not be a satisfying end.
Valar morghullis 
Well no, not unless they had a really good reason and the viewers were exposed to this information. And even then I'd make excuses for the humans bc 1. I'm a human and 2. My favorite characters happen to be human 
Nah mate no ones gonna sit on the throne.  All the main character will die except for a select few, the white walkers will be defeated and the kingdoms of westeros will be turned into republics

Night king has no reason to sit on the throne. I don't think he needs one. 
But the Wasteros would be a waste.
I think the White Walkers will destroy the Iron Throne.
The White Walkers are stopped, but because of all of the wars and conflict, food runs out and everyone starves to death. 
What about the Night King sits the iron throne and rules Westeros, but the last remnants of the great houses and some common folk flee to essos or the far west. Theres some of the sweet you're missing.

I could be wrong here, but I don't think anyone at all knows what the Night King wants. I think it's just senseless death and domination over the living. So thrones and symbolic titles and what not don't matter to him in that case, and is more so a force of nature who is slowly killing everyone.

What a dickhead thing to do.
Wow, this is so ridiculous!  
I've read the spoilers, but even so, thank you for the warning.  
super huge spoiler for season 7! most popular star "The Sun" might show up in the sky as a cameo. Sun declined to comment but sent UV rays, fans try to decipher UV rays for hidden message!
People did it before with the Force Awakens so this doesn't surprise me one bit. But thanks for the heads up anyway. 
Thank you so much! I don't want to be spoiled and will stay away. 
If anyone else sees stuff like this, report and message the moderators of the subreddit. Most subs have a 'don't be a dick' rule
I haven't heard anything about spoilers. How likely are they legit? I probably won't seek them out, but if they are really outlandish and ridiculous it might make for a fun read.
Damn, I usually enjoy reading downvoted comments, but I guess I'll have to edit my settings to block those.
Am I really going to have to leave Reddit until season 7 ends?
Nice job giving the heads up man. 

Side note I've read the "spoiled" script layout and im pretty sure its mostly bs
thank you
As if I needed another reason to avoid political discussion threads.

Daenerys Stormborn, the storm that wiped out the Targaryen fleet, on Dragonstone, right? Do you mean the one who smuggled them across the sea?
Tyrion seems to have won her over completely.  I'm looking forward to seeing that play out in a little more detail when/if the new book comes over.  In the show they talked like 3 times and then she made him hand of the queen.

Wasn't it Willem Darry though?
I'm guessing that the ice breaker will have happened off screen, it would be weird if they talk as if they've just met, even though they've been stuck on a boat together for several weeks.  
Tyrion already kind of vouched for him, I remember a scene when his name came up and she made a smart remark or something and Tyrion said something back.  Someone help me out lol, I feel like that will be all we get from there on that subject is that one scene.
The keeps themselves are fairly large, and there are several towers at Winterfell. However, I would assume a large portion of the King's company would also stay in a camp in the town outside Winterfell.

Winterfell has a stone village around it where the small folk live during the winters. I would assume a lot of guards, servants, and lesser family members might stay there.

Casterly Rock is built into a mountain, and most living space is inside of it. There are a few towers that go above the rock but when a mine runs dry, the workers just transform it into a liveable or usable space. So Casterly Rock has plenty of room for everyone!

I would imagine the Red Keep would be large enough to house the many nobles of the kingdoms since they are expected at big events like weddings, coronations, etc.

The castle I think that might be the smallest is the one in the Vale, not only because it's on top of mountain but also because it's so difficult and dangerous to even get to.
They state in the books that camps are made up all around any given keep or castle in these situations. The highborn lords and ladies will have a room or a tent within the castle walls, but most all of the armies and common folk just pitch tents and make camp wherever they need to, just outside the given fortress.
winterfell is suppose to be massive is it not? 
Robin Arryn would still be the ruler of the Vale, they'd likely just name another lord protector for him, maybe Yohn Royce.
Master Blaster
talking about forgotten lands, what about the Stormlands, now with no rigthful Baratheon alive. Those lands are pretty much untocuhed in the books too, even when it's so close to the Crownlands.
We do!

Robin isn't being slowly killed in the show so him 
In the books, while it's unlikely that Sansa would be named regent for Robert, as she is still a young maiden without any actual support. It's possible that Sansa may actually end up taking de facto control since in the novels, Robert is very fond of Sansa (as Alayne) despite the fact that the Lords Declarant would likely name a regent. It would be quite the twist if instead of marrying the next heir to the Vale, Sansa simply causes Petyr's demise, takes control and marches the Knights of the Vale North anyway; since I believe Sansa and Jon will converge on Winterfell at the same time although what roles Stannis, Roose, and Littlefinger will play in the novels are unknown. In the show, it's likely that this will be completely foregone since Robin is almost old enough to not need a regent and they have already declared for House Stark, so they fall under Stark control anyways.
Scouting reports may have told him Tyrion is the HotK, and others like Joffrey and Bronn wouldn't have the brains for this kind of strategy
I'm sure he knew that Tywin told Tyrion to be acting hand.  It wasn't like he was trying to keep it a secret
Stannis has an idea bout the state of King's Landing.

He knows Tywin and Jaime are in the field, Joffrey is a boy, Pycelle is old, and Cersei is Cersei.

Turpin is the only person who could be leading the forces.

They wouldn't leave the defense of King's Landing to someone as common as the Commander of the Gold Cloaks.
Each Lord gets a quarterly newsletter. I am sure it was in one of them.

You mean like during peacetime? They're at home, tending farms and working regular jobs. Just a small portion are professional guards. They didn't keep around standing armies all the time like we do today.

So when they talk about "calling the banners" they really mean gathering up men from their homes to come fight together.

In the books jorah makes a comment that there is only 200 (maybe 1k ) armoured knights in the 7 kingdoms when dany asks him could the dothraki conquer the kingdoms.Most of the people are just farmers who are given a sword for the first time.

I imagine that most the knights are lords sons and there the only ones who can afford armour.
Tywin would've called the guard and fucked up Tyrion. He doesn't need Tyrion, he doesn't like him, thats why he was willing to let him die for Joffrey's murder, Tywin was biding time for someone to come along and discover him
I think Tywin was just saying anything he could to get Tyrion to lower the crossbow..he's a smart, calculated guy. Tywin never loved Tyrion, and he only calls him his son or shows any amount of affection when it suits him, to gain a bit of favor in Tyrion's eyes. But this time he had simply gone too far, and nothing he could've done would have saved him. If somehow they had gone to 'talk' he probably would have had guards seize Tyrion and had him killed then and there, or as soon as possible. But he would probably use the situation to his advantage, saying that Tyrion had escaped somehow. That, or just bypass the trial because of the escape, and arranged an execution to make a big show of it.

Regardless, I don't see both men walking away from their conversation.

Would have*
I don't agree with the idea people have that Tywin would have no issue killing Tyrion. We've seen it before, Tywin does love Tyrion, but in a real fucked up, kind of obligated way. He is a Lannister after all. Had they gone back to the room, Tyrion would probably die, or at least be captured. Tywin above all else won't want to die, but it doesn't necessarily mean he could easily want Tyrion dead, just that it was Tyrion or him.
This sub, man.
If we're going to talk about hair --- Lets ask the real question:

Shouldn't Cersei have been able to grow a couple inches while Varys had time to cross the narrow sea to Dorne and back?  
It's okay.. next season begins in 7 to 8 months

Really awesome! Seriously cool, and amazing stitching work. I love the color of the cloth and the thread. I want one!
Pretty good, although the dire-wolf's lowered eyelids make it look stoned af.
More like you lose and die, or you win and then die slightly later.
Varys and Littlefinger, the two best players of the game. Just think about what they could achieve together if they teamed up.
Books: Rickon and Lyanna.
 
 Show: Oberyn and Dany
Littlefinger and Margaery Tyrell.  If you're talking about power couples in the traditional sense.

They had only two moments together IIRC - 

The first, when walking along Renly's camp: Littlefinger hints that he (and thus many others) are aware of Renly's "pillowbiting" proclivities (Cersei's term, not mine) and implies Renly won't be a good or long-lasting king.  Margaery basically conveys her awareness too but also demonstrates her competence in playing the game by ignoring Lttlefinger's jabs and putting him in his place ("The whole notion of marriage seems to confuse you, so allow me to explain: my husband is my king and my king is my husband.  Here is your tent, lord Baelish").

The second time is just after Renly's death, when Margaery gives Baelish possibly her most honest insight into her character: 

Baelish: "Do you want to be a queen?"

Margaery: "No.  I want to be THE queen."

Baelish: (impish grin)

The point is it seems like they'd be absolutely deadly together, if they combined their resources/resourcefulness and talents at manipulation.  She's implied to be a very similar character to him, possibly even his female counterpart (POSSibly) and while we ever got to see her plans fulfilled (or will we?  tinfoil?) their potential efficacy as a couple still lingers as an alternate story option to pine for.  

If you ask me it's a shame that that wasn't in the cards, especially given Baelish's involvement in Joffrey's demise, teamed up with none other than the Lady of Thorns, Margaery's grandmother Olenna Tyrell.  They're birds of a feather, those three. 
Robb stark and jon snow = goat
Jon Snow and Bronn 
Jaime Lannister and Catelyn Tully
Robb Stark and Dany
Tyrion and Sam
Brienne and the Hound
Littlefinger and Bronn

Jon and robb man.
Dany and Arya
Night king and Melisandre. Imagine what kind of shadow babies they could spawn.
My team, not couple, would be Robb and Stannis.

Cercei has nothing to contribute for dany that she does not have alerady (and its a psyco and everything dany stands against). An alliance betweem them would be the most ilogical and out of context thing that martin could write.
Zurik I want to have you babies, you clever silly god video tale maker you
Here's hoping Sansa avenges Ned's betrayal and death, and the root cause of the Stark's downfall, by executing Littlefinger once and for all. She doesn't trust him, or want him. She knows exactly what he's like now. The only thing she doesn't know is he was the one who got her father killed. I can't wait until she finds out. Hopefully Varys (who knows everything, ofcourse) will tell Jon when the two sides of Ice and Fire inevitably meet, and he will likely send a raven back to Sansa informing her of Littlefinger's treachery. At this point, Sansa calls a meeting with all the other northern lords (like the KITN scene) and publicly denounces him and demands his head. Atleast, that's how I want it to go down lol.
Aside from a few moments with a bit too much repetitive lines it's a well-done video like all from his channel. Never actually realized how Sansa's arc completely contradicts the kind of things she dreamed of back in Winterfell yet the video shows it pretty clearly.
I know Littlefinger is an awful person... But I'm really rooting for him.
I love Zurik's tribute videos, they seem to be really well edited and the songs are perfect.
Great video!!! I really want them to confront Littlefinger about betraying Ned before he dies.
Zurik is so talented. I can never get enough of his Jon Snow video..

Can someone describe the contents of the video? I don't feel like watching another Sansa circlejerk.
Complete, and by one author.
Just realized if Jon becomes the new Night King, it's Wrath of the Lich King all over again.

"There must always be a ~~Lich~~ Night King."
Nice try George. 
>Kill his brother in an epic duel

YES.

I want it to end with Dolorous Edd staring off into the sunset, then turn around to Lord Commander Mormont to say, "Boss, I just had the *craziest* dream."
Littlefinger gets to the throne before it is inevitably destroyed.

Gendry goes away and nobody sees him ever again - this is already true.

Jon dies but impregnates Dany, Tyrion will sadly die - inevitably again.
I reckon Dany takes the throne after fighting tooth and nail against both man and Other, only to realize she has no chance of producing an heir and that the realm will only devolve back into chaos once she dies. A bittersweet ending if there ever was one.
[removed]
I have a love hate relationship with many of these characters, but I felt a real sadness imagining them die even though I know it may be inevitable.
This made me realize how conflicted all my ideas are. I can't have Dany be the mad queen, marry Jon, sacrifice herself, never have kids, and reboot the Targ dynasty...
Gotta say, a lot of that artwork was amazing!
blah blah blah KingPounce blah blah blah
You should have included "rule  ---- as an option" 
*Goes to the very first question.*

*Sees that Gendry isn't an option for 'who will end up on the Iron Throne'.*

Literally unplayable. 
I would like ASOIAF to end.
4) Rickon?
How about an extremely long and detailed choose-your-own-adventure style book that ultimately ends with the Starks being on the brink of defeat, but - having accomplished their destiny - are whisked away by a pack of large birds. Depending on your choices, the birds are either red, blue or green. 
I want a happy incest ending. 


Rickon is an option :(
Yeah anyone else wanna see Podrick on the iron throne?
Tyrion writing ASoIaF would be kinda cliche, but also epic. I like that idea.
Thank you for clarifying what 'No one' means as an answer before each question.

After clicking it a few times I got worried I was accidentally voting for Arya Stark.
Everyone is dead, and in the throne sits the frozen king. beside the throne stands eternally vigilant, his most potent assassin, Arya Stark the Wight.
Filling this out made me realise I'm a romantic at heart and want happy endings - except when it comes to Jon and Dany.

Jon and Dany to fall in love. Dany to sacrafice her life to save the 7 kingdoms from the others. Jon to live beyond the wall to keep the peace.

Sansa on the iron throne with tyrion as advisor or husband. Childless.

Arya and Gendry to rule the north (with nymeria). Their kids to inherit the iron throne.

Theon to rule Pyke with or without Yara. 

Davos and wife happily ever after possibly ruling storms end.

Jaime and brienne rocking it at casterly rock.

Sam to modernise the citadel with now married maesters.  

Lots of happy endings so everyone else dies.     

...never going to happen....but I can dream

I really enjoyed this thanks! Now I really do have a clearer idea of what I'd like see. And I sort of realise it's happy starks with cute puppies.

Dying against the Others as main choice for most characters is quite bad I guess. Many will die way before.
Nice survey, interesting questions and I liked answering. I would've preffered if you didn't mix book and show facts though, but made one survey for the show and one for the books. For example: you call it a survey about the end of "ASOIAF" which is the book series, yet you include the Night King who doesn't even exist in the books and is a show invention. 

Of course, all of this depends on whether you think the two mediums will have the same ending regarding all of these characters. I for one beleive the endings will be radically different and only have tangible similarities, which makes the survey confusing overall.

Everything would come full circle. 

After dany And Jon defeat the others, Danny comes through and turns out she is bat shit cray cray. North decides they want to be a separate kingdom still. Dany has Jon killled for going against her and pisses everyone off. Rebellion follows again. Tryion nopes the fuck out and hides in casterly rock. Sansa leads army to attack kings landing with the vale and river lands and the north.Tyron leads Lannister army totoward the city with Jamie sent ahead to kings landing to strategize with dany while tryion leads Lannister army. Jamie has seen all before and confirms that dany has lost all her marbles to his brother. Tryion negotiates with Sansa to bring the Martel and his army to Sansas side. Dany tries to burn down the city. Jamie says damn this again and unsheaths his sword. Sansa recognizes her and tryions marraiage. 


Tidr. Sansa sits on the iron throne. With disturbing birth baby mruder scene mid way through season 7
I'd like to see Tyrion sitting on the iron throne.
Done. :)
soon
When are you thinking of releasing the results? Maybe include it in a separate post but also in this post for people who might miss it when its hot on the subreddit but can come back to their comments (like me, coming back to see this comment in a week).
White walkers win, everyone dies. 

White walkers start a utopian frozen society. 
It's too long and complicated imo. I understood it, but it took way too much thought on many answers. I got through 13 questions and burned out. I tried to submit so youd have my partial opinion but all responses are required.
They will disappear and nobody will hear of them anymore. 
Why is this a option. 
Do people really want lose end in their stories
Everyone singing "Put a Little Love in Your Heart" during the ending credits.
How do you see the results?
Pass on the survey, I hope humans are culled down to 1/10th of the current population before finally prevailing over the undead to drive home the point that infighting in lieu of threats from the north were their downfall. 
A civil war. 
I answered "Unknown" for some of the "who will rule place X" because I don't think every new ruler will be someone we will have had to know about already.
hopefully with a song and dance that warns against using magic for evil. (only use it for good things people)
Everyone and everything dies.  Westeros and Essos born anew from the wreckage.
Everyone dies and eternal night rules the land forever.
it will be interesting to see the final results
I think I contradicted myself a couple of times. I wasn't ready! I realized I haven't really thought this through. I sort of want the ending that GRRM wants...if only I could get that? That would be fantastic. Especially today. Today would be a good day for a distraction. 
Quick question can i do the survey more then once
However it ends, i want it to turn out to all have happened on mars a few million years ago
End? What's that? I thought it was going to be infinite, so that Martin could live forever.
In my lifetime
It's actually the future and magic is just how they perceive lost/forgotten technology
In my lifetime.
I would like it to end before we do.
The comet takes out their world.
Giant meteor.
When I'm not so old, wine in my belly, a mouth on my cock and the final book in my hands. I'm the god of tits and wine and that's how I would like the series to end. 
I sure would
In my lifetime.
A musical style episode, a la monty python
TIL about myself: I'm a total sap and I just want everyone to live happily ever after. 
Gendry never being heard from again is only one option among many?
OP, you've written "dinasty" in the survey. Fix it to dynasty.
I don't. I do, but I don't.

Something, something, journey.
Tyrion rules Westeros, Theon gets a new penis courtesy of a red women priestess, Sam mercy kills Gilly & Sam, Jr., Sansa goes back to Tyrion to rule beside him, Dany dies.  Happy endings overall.  
Why was there no option that the citadel will remain unchanged?
Wait, was this the show or the book? Because in the show, I expect a CleganeBowl, but not in the books. 

Here's what I think will happen:

Daenerys alliance/marry Joh, they march on KL, Jamie kills Cercei first, Tyrion is left in KL as the king, John and Daenerys go fight the WW, they die (but john has to kill Daenerys somehow for the prophecy to be realized), bran saves the day but dies in the process (reveal to john his heritage before he dies), LittleFinger has grabbed all the lands in the power vacuum and is Tyrion biggest threat, Varys is originally ruling next to Tyrion but he eventually disappear, with Tyrion. Speculation is that he found Tysha and eloped with her. The Iron islands are ruled by Asha, Reek is killed alongside John, Arya kills around until she follow John in wolf form, get physically killed and lives through Nymeria. Sansa will be married to LittleFinger (not by choice), and will control the north, but might leave Bran in charge if he survives this mess. The sand snakes will hopefully die taking KL, not sure of the politic there. Jamie will suicide after killing Cercei. Jorah will be forgotten/sacrifice himself in a useless cause, and Davos will live at court alongside Tyrion until he elopes, and will then try to be forgotten once LittleFinger grabs the throne. Oh! Maybe Arya will reserve her death for LittleFinger, after he takes the throne, and the show/book ends as we have no idea who will sit on it.  
ive come to the point that i dont caare anymore for the books, it takes Martin hell of a lo-ooong time to write, being the day ill buy the last 2 of course and read it, but im literaly 0 hyped for them, and i´d say 20% interested.
Obligatory "You put Arya in the options twice!" comment.
Jorah being the Azoh Ahai is something I never considered, but now that I saw it written out it makes a certain kind of sense.
Winter comes. Whitewalkers kill everyone while they are politicking. The vision of a snow/ash covered iron throne comes true. But first Jaime kills Cersei for becoming the Mad Queen. 
Me? Oh, a bittersweet ending that fulfills the necessity of including Dorne. I was promised.
Going through these questions I'm getting mild anxiety. Some of these scenarios seem awesome while sad. Others seem terrifying although likely. I'm scared.
I'm kinda feeling that the source of magic will be destroyed, leading to a return of natural seasons, the death of the Children, and the end of the Targs and their dragons. all of that wonder will be gone from the world at the price of winning the war against the Others.  
Dany represents that wonder and magic, and she will go alongside her dragons.  
I'm borrowing heavily from LOTR here - just like the elves left middle earth. 
These long seasons seem to have held back progress for a long time and with the end of them I think we'll see a golden age - but one without magic. 
"And then Ned woke up."
Dragons in crowns.
Fire and Blood
Kinda boring if you think the Nights King is going to be victorious. Everyone dies but Sansa who becomes the Nights Queen (cuz I'm weird and I like to guess things with no actual chance it would happen). 
Tyrion Wine Co Ltd [EST. Longest Winter]
A dragon wakes up startled. It's breathing heavily. Fire erupts outs of its mouth. Another dragon comes around the bend. It's huge maw agape and the dragon says "There there honey it was a bad dream. There's no such things as humans or white walkers. It was just a scary story your dad likes to tell." The dragon slowly falls asleep while the momma dragon starts singing a lullaby. Fin 
That was fun. Most of these are poorly drafted or do not have adequate ways to combine choices or write in other answers. Good job!

To clarify: most of these kinds of polls - yours was fine
All of it is just a dream that Bran had while being in a coma after falling off the tower.
All i want is Jaime to kill himself after murdering his sister. Would be so perfect.
Nice try, George.
A war between Dany and Cersei results in both sides being severely weakened (maybe one wins, it doesn't matter). 
The North, led by Jon attempts to do it's best to bolster the wall while begging for peace and cooperation from the other armies, which are so caught up in their feud that they can't see the bigger picture. Winterfell acts as the last bastion, standing against the growing army of the Others, but can't manage to hold the line. 
Everyone is wiped out by the walkers, showing that pride and greed results in the fall of the world. Honestly, I just feel like the series would be pretty deep and meaningful if the white walkers killed everyone. Especially since they've been a problem from page/episode 1, yet they are constantly ignored by people just trying to fight for a big chair.
My ideal story for the rest of ASOIAF.

Season 7:  

Dany reaches Westeros. She lands near kings landing and set's out to speak with the Queen of Westeros. While she is there Cersei shuts her down and laughs as Euron attacks Danys fleet. Dany retreats and wins the battle. During this Jon hears of Dany and thinks "Dragons, Perfect! We can kill the white walkers." Jon rides south and meets with Dany after the battle. Jon convinces Dany to leave the Iron throne alone for now as Cersei has locked up the keep. Dany and Jon head north. Dany takes Jon on romantic flight on a dragon and they scout out the white walkers. A few episodes in the White walkers attack. Dany fights them off for a while but struggles to do really any damage to the Knight King. Bran has visions of Westeros being attacked without the wall and everyone being killed. He goes back in time to make sure the wall is built and there he finds out more secrets of the White walkers. He leaves journals behind that Sam finds in current day. Once sam finds those he returns to Jon. With this information Dany pushes past the wall. She once again is doing really well until Bran fucks up and the Night King tricks him into doing something that brings the wall crashing down (killing one of Danys dragons.) Dany get's a little angry and burns everything past the wall. Jon and Dany end the season in a battle with the Night King and finish him off. 

Season 8:  

Jon had made a deal with Dany previously if she helped kill the White Walkers he would help her take over westeros. He is worried now that she will be another mad targ. He still stays true to his word and goes south with her. They meet with cersei again and cersei tries to manipulate them and pretends she will offer peace. Jon and Dany start speaking about a possible proposal to unite Westeros. During that time Cersei sets off an explosion that kills another one of Danys dragons. Now dany goes mad and Jon tries to calm her down. Dany doesn't listen and basically burns the red keep. Dany turns against Jon and his army retreats into the city and leave a lot of Danys forces outside the gate and at the Red Keep. Jon fights his way into the Red keep and confront dany. Dany attacks Jon and Jon stabs her. She keeps attacking and he is forced to beat her to death. He stands before the Iron throne with all his men and advisors in the throne room. Some of them start to raise their swords and chant for Jon to be King of Westeros. Jon sheaths his sword and walks out of the room saying "Fuck Kings and Queens." Last episode is Jon turning or fighting off Danys forces and dealing with the dragon. During the last episode he works with other leaders to create a new system of ruling that ends up with a Republic of Westeros.

Rick wakes up from the hospital and sees Lori, Carl and Shane happy to have him alive. 
I voted
Nobody has a problem with the outcome. We just didn't like the ridiculous chase or the way the Waif went about her assassination attempt.

There were a million opportunities for D&D to make this arc compelling, but in the end, we got mediocrity verging on laziness.
I've just applied my head cannon to be that Arya was luring the waif out but it backfires. 

She slept for at least two weeks with milk of the poppy and the reopening of her wound looked worse than it was. She wasn't at all injured when she confronted Jaquen 

She then lured the waif to her safe space with the blood on the walls. She was able to defeat the waif because she mastered the darkness when she was blind. 
I didn't mind that scene. I enjoyed it much more on my re watch. But it did feel very unlike GoT. Arya got stabbed and was somehow able to out run the Waif. Really? I liked Arya cutting the candle and using her ability to fight blind to defeat the Waif. But the chase scene was just really odd.
Was a terrible scene.The wounds she suffered would of been fatal at the time.And before there even healed she runs threw the streets etc such bs.

The creators should of been ashamed of the handling of that including the fact u just fuked over a brotherhood of killers and just stand there in public nonchalantly and let someone approach you.

I apologize for judging this episode so harshly upon release. Upon further consideration, I rescind and amend my public review. Thanks again to the writers, the actors, and the community that makes it all possible.
Sweeeeet.

I've wanted to see both for so long. I feel like with how entrenched the Lannisters' are in the plot, it'll be nice to see where they hail from. All we've gotten so far is a glimpse of the forest Cersei was traipsing through.
House Tarly is pledged to Highgadren, which has pledged to Daenarys, so we'll be seeing Lord Tarly fight against the Lannisters? Fuck yes

HIGHGARDEN YESSSSSSSSSS
In no particular order

- Slapping Joffrey at Winterfell
- Slapping Joffrey at King's Landing
- Speech at the Battle of the Blackwater
- Demanding a Trial by Combat after being charged with Joffrey's murder
- Confessing his "crimes" at the Vale
- Threatening Joffrey at his (Tyrion's) wedding
- Rooting out Pycelle as Cersei's spy
- Killing Tywin
- Turning Lancel into his own personal bitch/spy
- Saving Sansa from torture (edited)
I wouldn't call it his best moment, but I always thought that his joke about the futility of everything was very underrated.  
Here's the joke for people that didn't catch it or that forgot:  

>**Varys:** Are we really going to spend the entire road to Volantis talking about the futility of everything?  

>**Tyrion:**You're right, no point.
I just love the scene where him and Dany sit down for the first time for some wine. Just sat there the entire time with a massive grin on my face. "So here we are, two terrible children of two terrible fathers" 
By far the best Tyrion moment, ever, is his reaction/speech after Shae comes out to testify against him. The pure anger and loathing in his voice, the look on his face, and the power of his words send a shiver down my spine every time. Such an incredibly powerful, satisfying scene.
- Battle of the Blackwater speech (Basically him throughout all of the battle of blackwater though)

- Killing Tywin 

- Trial Speech 

- Teaching Joffrey a lesson while he's torturing Sansa

- Unchaining the dragons 
There are so many great Tyrion moments!

Having recently re watched the show, one moment I love is when Tyrion slaps Joffrey at the beginning of S1. That's a great moment that I did not appreciate on my first time watching!
1-Speech during trial
2-Condemning Janos to the Wall
3-Slapping Joffrey at Winterfell
4-Getting to know about Podrick
5-Trying to get Grey Worm and Missandei to drink
6-Confessing his crimes
7-How he'd like to die;-) 
8-EVERY CONVERSATION WITH BRONN
9- In the sailboat with Jorah
10- "I need to speak to someone with hair"

Talking about Orson Lannister with Jaime.

Oberyn vs Gregor. Was on the edge of my seat the whole time, so much at stake 
Ned vs Arthur Dayne
Jaime vs Ned because the knife to the eye that happened just prior was slick.
Not a single mention of Bronn vs Ser Vardis?  That fight is what got me truly hooked on GoT.  It was so different than any other scene I'd ever....seen. It just felt real, no CGI/SlowMo/Fancy Camera work.  It made the combatants feel like real humans who are swinging actual heavy steel instead of foam swords.  Every swing looks as though it take real effort to make, and could throw a combatant off balance.  

TLDR; Bronn vs Ser Vardis was the most realistic fight I've ever scene (get it?)
Mine would be the first but unfortunately short Cleganebowl, in the first season.

When Sandor ducked Gregor's cut by bowing to Robert, that was just awesome
Yeah Jamie vs. Ned was good.  You could see in Jamie's eyes his confidence was waning as the fight went on.  You could read his thoughts as: "Okay I'm going to toy with Stark a little bit then I'll finish him off.  Oh he's pretty good.  Wow, he's pretty strong.  Uh oh, I just remembered this guy 1v1ed Dayne.  Fuck."  

Which is why the Lannister guard spears Ned, he could see Jamie's face and knew he was unsure.  At that point, as a Lannister guard you have two options.  One, spear Ned and deal with Jamie's wrath.  Two, do nothing and if Jamie dies deal with Tywin's wrath.  I think the guard made the right decision. 

But for me the best fight was Brienne vs. The Hound.  The build up to that fight was amazing.  The stakes were high.  The music was great, the fight itself was real, raw, and gritty.  In the end the better fighter won clean.  You can't ask for more than that. 
Jon Snow vs White Walker

Hard to beat some of the ones already mentioned, but that one was incredible. As short as it was, you didn't know what was going to happen to the very end.
I have to say Brienne VS The Hound was easily the most intense, brutal, and realistic fight so far in the series. Just two brutish warriors, strong as hell, clashing in a fury of mud and blood

However,

The fight between Oberyn and The Mountain was equally gripping, and had me on the edge of my seat with anticipation more than almost any other moment in the show. Really tough to decide between these two!
My favourite was Brienne vs Jaime on the bridge, although I would've liked Jaime to do a bit better like he did in the books to really show he was the best swordsman in Westeros.


My favorite is probably when The First Sword of Braavos does not run!

The way Syrio just toys with those Lannister soldiers is wonderful.  And he drops still the most badass line in the while series.  "What do we say to the God of death?"
Oberyn - Gregor was certainly the most spectacular fight, but I'd give it to the Brienne - Sandor fight as well. The mixture of brute force and skill from both participants made for a great showing. Plus it doesn't happen in the books, so it was a nice added touch. 
Ooooh there's so many great ones!

But probably Brienne vs The Hound. The sword fight was awesome! Then they started attacking each other with their bare hands and Brienne bit his ear off. It was such a brutal fight but it was epic and I did not expect it to get that violent!
Wun Wun v. the Night's Watch archer.  When he smashes him against the wall and then tosses him like a rag doll.  Second place is when Robert Strong biffs the public urinator and splatters brain matter against the stone wall.
Jorah in the Fighting Pits. Done and dusted
Jon Snow and Quorin Halfhand. Everything about this fight was perfect. The setting, the stakes, the results. He had to kill his "brother" It wasn't like Corin was going easy on him either, they were legitimately fighting to the death, Snow just had to win. 
Jon vs the Magnar of the Thenns at castle black. 

The Castle Black Battle background was awesome the contrasting styles were great.

 I feel it was one of those fights that helped develop jon in a wsy Ser Rodrick never did for the stark boys. Kinda like the karl fooking tanner fight but more exciting and jon won on his own after having to improvise with the hammer, something you wouldn't expect from Robb or Ned. 
Oberyn vs Gregor is clearly the standout. Bronn and Ser Vardis was good. I didn't like the Sandor vs Brienne fight, it was too flashy. The standoff before it is nice though.
one not getting a lot of love so far is Bronn vs Vargis.  They did a great job with that fight coming from the books.  Mountain vs viper and mountain vs hound are two of my favorites too.  

couple more under the radar duels

1. jon vs halfhand
2. jon vs thenn
3. jon vs white walker
4. beric dondarion vs hound
5. drogo vs random dothraki
6. jorah vs dothraki
7. loras vs brieene 
8. Wun Wun vs Boltons  
Jon versus WW

I haven't held onto my chair so hard in my life.
Umber vs Tormund.  He stabbed home with a deer antler and ripped out his fucking throat with his teeth. Tormund is the fucking shit. 
Sand snakes. Just kidding !
Arthur Dayne for sure! Best choreographed sword fight in the show.
Tormund vs Ser Alliser Thorne was probably my favorite, or maybe Jon Snow vs the Thenn guy.  
Does the entire battle at Castle Black count as a duel?

Oberyn vs The Mountain 
Mine is very different from the rest. The hound vs berric at the brotherhood without banner camp. I love the effect the fire added to the fight
I agree that Jaimie went into his fight with Edard Stark overconfident in his ability. What is in play here is Ned Stark's reputation. He defeated Ser Arthur Dayne in a multiple participant combat and Ser Barriston Selmy had immense respect of his abilities which Jaimie would have picked up in conversation. Jaimie eagerness to match against Ned in the tourney was dashed when Ned refused to participate. So when he got his chance, he took it. The big difference was in combat experience. Jaimie had some experience fighting bandits, was trained by Ser Arthur Dayne when he was his squire and would have practiced against the other King's Guards, including Ser Barriston and, of course, the experience of the tourney. Ned grew up with the best Master's at Arms that the Starks could find, sharpened the skills on wildlings and bandits, then at 18-20, when Jaimie was being held as a hostage by Aerys II, led the Northern forces in the Rebellion, fighting at the Battle of the Bells, the Trident and the Relief of Storm's Landing. In a feudal society, the war leader fought in the front ranks, having arrayed his forces and committed them as best he could, since feudal mission command simply wasn't responsive enough to manage a battle as is done today. Ned got a lot of combat experience that Jaimie did not. Jaimie was a couple of years younger than Ned, but spent the next 15 years on guard duty and combat practice. Ned would have had a lot of his time taken up by his duties as Lord Stark of House Stark and as Lord Paramount and Warden of the North, but he would have continued to practice daily. So Ned had fought for his life in combat far more than Jaimie ever had, which would mean Ned's skills were honed in bloody swords and death. Which is why he surprised Jaimie when they engaged in single combat, He was two years older and heavier, but he played to his strengths. If they had fought in armor, Ned would have had a real advantage. 
Best single combat though is the "Red Viper" vs. "The Mountain". Best multiple combat scene was Ser Arthur Dayne and companion against Ned and his followers.
Jon is still dead, and, excluding theories, Sandor is dead.
Grenn and Pyp are actually both fine in the books
Stevron Frey. Ryman Frey. Petyr Frey. Aegon Frey. Cleos Frey. Tion Frey. Aenys Frey. Rhaegar Frey. Jared Frey. Tytos Frey. Symond Frey. Merrett Frey. Little Walder Frey. 
Factoring out Jon and the Hound (since I assume they'll both be back), the only one I could ever figure out when I previously considered this was Beric Dondarrion.
This is a complicated one but if I recall Little Sam - Gillys baby. 

Jon switched Gilles baby with Mande Rayders baby so Melisandre wouldn't be able to use its "kings blood".

What's strange here is that they were originally releasing exclusive steel books of Seasons 5 and 6.

They were like the Atmos steel books with the collectible magnets.

Season 5 was the Targaryen sigil on top of the Meereenese Great Pyramid.

Season 6 was the Braavosi Titan.

But, now, it appears that only Season 5 is the exclusive.
I have no effing clue wtf they're doing. It's pissed me off too.
No, actually, I wasn't. I was raised Catholic.

Amazing visuals. That scene with Jon and Ygritte on top of the wall is one of the most beautiful moments in the series. Trully amazing. Nice work my friend.  
I really hope we get to see the Land of Always Winter again, now with bigger budget.

You must have been watching *haard*
I watched the series for the first time just before season six aired. I definitely preferred watching weekly over binging. Makes each episode much more memorable, and reading all the theories online is half the fun. Also, with a show as popular as GoT, I guarantee you at least a few major spoilers will find their way to you.
Weekly my friend, and join us in the discussion/speculation after each episode. Reddit makes GoT even more fun, really. These guys and girls are great <3
That's up to you. If you want to discuss each episode and/or fear spoilers, you should watch them as soon as they air.
That would be a hell of a lot of spoilers to avoid.
I say watch in 2 episode bursts, and don't prioritize it when wondering what to do. It'll last longer and you'll still get that nice, comfy 2 hour session of pure beauty
Weekly - Theorizing what will happen next is fun!
Weekly! Binge watching is great but it can get confusing sometimes, especially with a show like GoT. Watching weekly gives you time to analyze each episode and discuss and theorize.
Weekly, all the speculation and discussion between episodes makes the whole experience better.

Which seat should I take?
I say combo! I watched this past season by watching weekly, but binging the previous episodes earlier in the day. Rewatching helped me pick up a lot of nuances and foreshadowing, and get hyped for the upcoming episode. Then after the episode airs come here to discuss the hype and theories! 
Watch it weekly because if you wait you'll probably get spoiled. And then binge it when season 7 its over. 
The only reason that I don't wait and binge is because I know the show is going to get spoiled.  I prefer binging, but can you avoid the internet for that long?
I say each week but even now when I rewatch I catch little things I may have missed.
I prefer binging the show. Waiting weekly I always forget some details of the previous episode, especially if it's largely a filler episode just moving the plot forward. I always rewatch the show from the start before a new season comes out though. 
Neither, start the novels if you haven't. If you have, then keep on keeping on.
I believe the NW vow still holds as the highest vow. He went to the Citadel to train to become the new Maester of the NW did he not?
He went to the Citadel specifically to become a maester so he could replace Aemon as the maester at Castle Black. Sam is still a brother of the NW, he's just studying at the Citadel. I think normally they would just request the Citadel send them a new maester, but Jon wants it to be Sam because he has knowledge of/experience with what's beyond the Wall.

Sam is still in the Night's Watch.  
I think it's because they are, in their own way, becoming "no one". They give up their families and lands and titles and are basically dead as far as their future is concerned. Their life belongs to the watch from that point forward.
The idea is that they give up everything and live for the watch.  You can give up your existing family, but starting a family after joining is a betrayal of your oath, just as leaving the watch to rejoin your prior wife would be.
that is because regardless of their position before joining, their families are no longer theirs once they join. This was largely part of Jon's conflict in wanting to help the Starks and even being offered the Stark name while under the oath of the Night's Watch. He had to put his oaths first, and this conflicted with his familial and natural desires. 

This is not unusual. And this is not an unusual test for a Night's Watchman to encounter...it all comes down to whether he is able to resist that temptation and maintain his oaths, which in comparison to the people you love can be a hard hurdle to pass. 
  Often it is a court choice like going to jail or joining the army instead.  If they will execute you , you will go to the wall instead. bastards are sent to get them out of the way too, like Jon.
Because begger's can't be choosers. 
You start fresh all over when you take the Nights Watch oath.
Great question. Isn't the reason they can't have families is so they don't get too attached? So it wouldn't make much sense if they already had a family. This is cool....I never thought about it.

Religious orders let you do this as well.  You can't be admitted if you have dependants, but there are plenty of monks/nuns that joined the order after their SO died and kids have grown up.

I believe there have also been cases where a husband and wife will be both admitted to different orders even though they're still married - but that would require special permissions.
Well it would be irrelevant if they had children or wife's prior to taking the black. For example Commander Mormont still had Jorah technically(even if he was exiled) but you get the point. The watch is a complete CTL-ALT-DEL kinda thing with your past. 
i think the watch really enforce their laws however if you remember when jon ran away to join rob near the end of season 1 but ended up coming back the lord commander told him "if we killed everyone who ran away for the night ghost would watch the wall" or something along those lines. which in essence he is saying people especially the men of the night watch are not perfect and are going to break their oaths it just a matter of minimising it 
You denounce your titles, lands, family, everything when you join. 
For some people especially those with highborn status, as a lifetime punishment, they are sent to Castle Black to serve there for the rest of their lives.
They let in the men who have had wives and children, but their vow requires them to denounce. I don't know if its like the Muslim oath said thrice, (I divorce you said three times), and then its done, but basically once they take the Black and Make the Vow, they're childless and spouseless.
I really need to rewatch the first season.

I think my all time favorite episode is still "Blackwater". It really stands out to me as a perfect hour of television.
My favorite, by far, is season 3, episode 4.

Varys has the speech about revenge to Tyrion and shows his tormenter in the box.

Danny sells the dragon for the unsullied and then we realize she's understood Valaryan all along, and then has the dragon burn the bad guys.

We see the first glimpse of a broken Jaime drinking horse urine and fighting in the mud after he had his hand cut off.  First glimpse of sympathetic Brienne as well.

Ramsay gives Theon the run around thinking he's helping him escape only to bring him back to the same cell.

Castor's keep gets over run by the nights watch coup
I think part of the reason this episode doesn't resonate so much on the first viewing (assuming you haven't read the book) is because at that point the audience assumes Ned is going to come out okay.  Baelish's betrayal doesn't pack as much of a punch when the audience thinks it's just another story beat before the hero wins in the end. Ned actually losing his head in 'Baelor' is more memorable because for a first time viewer it's the moment that truly sets GoT/ASoIaF apart from most other stories.
It still pisses me of that Cersei just teared that letter apart. Damn. 
Whenever I rewatch the series I always have a moment somewhere around that episode when I remember how many storylines have started and stopped, that the show is completely different with just a handful of characters that are still alive  by S6.  

That episode is without a doubt one of the most important episodes, because like you said SO much happens that influences almost everything in the show, I can't think of one character that wasn't impacted by that episode.
The confrontation in the throne room remains the most tense scene of the series for me.  And the conclusion of that scene is what convinced me that GoT is a show where "shit gets real" as they say.  
That was the episode that got me hooked. When people complain to me that they watched the first two episodes or so, I tell them to watch until episode 7 and then make their choice. 
Agreed! This is my favorite ep too. Love the Drogo and Cersei speeches

Edit: Tywin intro too! Such a good one
> we also have the brilliant entrance of Tywin as he guts a stag

This is one of my favorite moments in the show. I've always loved the imigary of the head of house Lannister skinning a stag (the sigil of house Baratheon) shortly after King Robert dies. Might not be very subtle, but it's very Tywin.
"Black of hair"
I'm speaking for myself here. But I think I overlooked the brilliance of this episode because I didn't know what lies ahead. Always happens to me early on in the story whether it be a book, TV series, or a movie. Thus calls the reason to re-watch it from S1E1.:)
I read the titel as S7E1
After re-watching the show again recently, so many episodes get more respect as you can see the dotted lines go further back than you thought.   I still love hte red wedding episode the best due to a lot of watchers not knowing what was going to happen.
I have always thought this was the best episode to show how great this series was.

I just re watched the show and first time around that episode didn't stand out too much. But on my re watch I did notice how many important things happen. Such a great episode!
i think not many people place it in top 10 because its very much political, people find the accion episodes in higher regard
It's so strange that people like the Tywin intro now.

Gutting a stag is a beautiful moment symbolically, sure.  But coming from the books, all we know about lords and Tywin especially is that -- gutting a stag is a dirty, lowly task, and it's therefore extremely out of character for Tywin to do.  So it was just very...jarring, I'd say.
I agree with you but the one thing that drags this episode down is the 10min long sexposisition scene with Littlefinger and Ros. 
I didn't particularly like this episode as it highlighted what I think tends to be one of the weaknesses for the show, really dumb decisions by the protagonists. Ned confronting her was ferociously and unbelievably dumb. It drove the plot forward but strained believability. It ruins  my sympathy for the character. It destroys the impact of his death for me. Of course he died, it was his own fault. I find it much more interesting when the characters are behaving and scheming in a believably intelligent way. If the throne is truly a game, I want to watch professionals play.

Episode six of season 4.  Tyrion.
Imma let you finish, but S4E9 'The Watcher on the Wall' was the best episode of all time...of all time! Even better than Battle of Bastards or Allahu Akbar Cersei.

Beautiful!
i like how the title says everything it matches so good
Let us lay down the facts beforehand:

* Baelish controls the Knights Of The Vale, which may be considered top 3 in terms of army strength.

* With the defeat of the Boltons, Jon now controls the entire North and the Wildling army. A scary combination

* Cersei controls the entire Lannister army, which is a strong force even on its own

Jon's Army and Lannister forces might be considered to be equal in terms of strength, and Baelish forces would tip the balance

So if I were Baelish, do I trust the psycho Cersei or the newly crowned King Of The North?

Who would more likely be the better leader? Who would be less likely to self destruct? Who would more likely win with my support?

I'd go with Jon all the way. And backstab him the moment a good chance appears.

That's what I believe Baelish would do
Why would he want to back Cersei? She's clearly on the losing side, and LF isn't one to pick losing sides. 
LF's best play right now is to be in Jon's government.
Littlefinger has chosen his side, his alliance with Cersei has been permanently severed.  
He will stick with the North, but he'll probably try to stab Jon in the back and claim more power in the North.  

All of his interests are vested in the North right now, there will be no more switching sides at this point, he'll simply try to continue climbing the ladder from the North.  
Ughhh, he said he declared for the north for all to hear. Cersei will treat him as a simple enemy obviously?
Hopefully dir a horrendous awful death. I fucking hate that cunt an her whole family

What can she do?She has enemies on every side.

Littlefinger is the lord protector of the vale,lord paramount of the riverlands and has ties to the north.He controls or has influence on 3 of the 7 kingdoms.

The lannisters have to deal with Dany + dorne+highgarden+the north+riverlands+the vale.There pretty much fucked.There only hope is that the white walkers take down the wall before they can wiped out and there enemies all die and there left the rulers of ash.
LF can just go back and tell Cersei that he was trying to take out the Boltons because of their treasons and got in the middle of a battle  
LF controls Harrenhal and the Vale, if he can control everything between his strongholds then he can continue to play both sides. Keeping the North/Riverlands on one side and Kings Landing on the other. Making him the go-between for both sides. We only have his word that he 'sent ravens declaring allegiance to house Stark'. I think Cersei is still in a position to be played by LF. 
She'll likely Marry Littlefinger to gain control of the Knights of the Vale so she can defend against Dany and Jon if need be. This also tips in Littlefinger's favor. He'll be King, just as he always wanted.
You should name your sewing machine Olly. 
Awesome! How long did it take to make these?
Jon looks like he knows more than nothing. 0/10 complete lack of immersion. /s
As a professional costume designer, if you don't bleed on your work it's not done. 
I used to be a cosplayer like you, then I took a machine needle through the finger.
Are those hair extensions or do you both have glorious long hair?
Where are the obliterated finger pics? You can't just tell us about a sweet ass injury and not show it.
Jon looks more like some wildling that would try to kill Jon.
Great job! Are you hardcore sweating under all those layers ??
you guys look so good
Funny thing, you both look more like the characters' description in the books than the HBO actors
Wow the sword is dope
You sew nothing Jon Snow. 
I'm happy to see a JSnow cosplay where it's not just a dude that looks a lot like Kit wearing all black. Nice work!
That is really cool! You are very talented!
I used to be a cosplayer, but then I took a sewing needle to the knee.
These are insanely good. You should come to [Con of Thrones](http://conofthrones.com/) next year. 

Oh that wonderful moment when working on a costume and you feel that sting and hear the thunk and your first thoughts are "don't bleed on the costume, don't bleed on the costume. ."
You sew nothing, Jon Snow. You left it all to your girlfriend to make the two costumes 
I hope wherever you wore those at, that it was nice and cool. 
Damn I can see why! That fabric looks pretty thick.
https://i.imgur.com/bjpBlg1.jpg 
This guy has seen things...
Nailed it.
Jesus Christ these are great!
How did you handmake *Longclaw*?
Bagawd, it's Matt Hardy!
If he cut his hair, Jon looks like he'd make an even better Stannis.
Wow that's amazing!
These are stunning. I especially love your costume. The detail in the folds is great. Amazing work!
Your guy fella there looks like Broken Matt Hardy. Brother Nero?
How does a needle through the finger compare to an arrow to the knee?
I think that he would make a pretty solid Mance Rayder if he cut his hair. Good job on the costumes, they look great!
Wow, amazing work! I'm super impressed!
Ben Eller?
As a Houstonian, I pray you live somewhere cold.  Also, amazing job, the costumes look fabulous!
Can't figure out which one of you is wearing a wig. Both sets of hair look real to me. And you made the wig? Did you scalp someone with the hair you wanted? 

I keep zooming in on your foreheads trying to see the line. 
Yikes.. my wife took a needle through her finger making our Halloween costumes this year... I do not envy you that... but the costumes look great!
Hot Ygritte and "Weird Al" Snow, I dig it
Fantastic job! I wish I had the patience to sew outfits together like this
You must have been sweating balls
The costumes are awesome! :)
Damn where do you guys live? Hopefully somewhere cold thats a lot of fur
Was really hoping for a picture of the finger.
was hoping to see your skewered finger.
That guy looks more like Khal drogon then Jon Snow
Josh Brolin as Jon Snow?

Gah, another revealing cosplay on the front page. 
Handmade with a machine :)
If Dany leaves her keys in the Dragon while she is in the store to get some Arbor Gold, then Littlefinger will easily steal it.
That's probably next to impossible given that Varys is one of Dany's main advisors. Tyrion also knows more than a thing or two about Littlefinger as well, though maybe not as much as Varys. I can't imagine Dany even considering a marriage with Littlefinger given the advise of her two top advisors. 

Also, Dany has no reason to marry Littlefinger. He's almost powerless in the North right now and has no friends there. the Northmen don't and will never trust him. Yohn Royce hates his guts. His only key to the Vale is Sweet Robin, and if history's an indication, I'll bet all Dany needs to do to secure the Vale is offer him a ride on a dragon. 
Little finger is obsessed with Catalyn, and by extension now, Sansa. The only person he really wants is her. I doubt he'll even try to wed Dany.

With Tyrion & Varys by her side, I seriously doubt that LF will get very near to her.

He has a better chance of trying to make peace with Cersei. But I expect Sansa or Arya to slit his throat before long.
Ooh, so did I (and now I feel able to post on here without running into an unknown topic)! 

I remember feeling something similar when reading about LF - his story has progressed much more in the show so it's difficult to judge what'll happen, but for what it's worth I think that Danny rocking up will turn many heads and folk will be scrambling around her to the detriment of their previous loyalties! 

Now, got any good book recommendations as I've got a wee bit of spare time ;) 
I've read the first four books and I'm almost halfway through with the fifth and final one, but speaking strictly about the show do you think Littlefinger could make his way back to kings landing to council Cersei or does he realize that she's done for? I think Varys and little finger being on opposing factions contributes to how much of the game they control and it will be interesting to see how it plays out. 
Hot pie?... Is that you?!?
I want to eat this.

Season 4 Episode 10 "The Children" ... Tywin dies, the hound (almost) dies, Stannis saves the nights watch, and Bran meets the Children of the Forest!!

I know the production of Season 6 was great and all, but the content in this ONE EPISODE is not only crucial to the rest of the story, but is totally shocking to everyone! I think most people were able to predict the outcome of S6E9 (BOB) and most of the deaths in Season 6. D&D certainly didn't do a bad job with S6, but the element of surprise was kind of lost.
winds of winter, but the biggest shocker moment for me was Hardhome

IT CAME OUTTA NOWHERE DUUUUUUUUUDE
The last 3 episodes of season 4 (Mountain/viper, WOTW, the children) are the best 3 consecutive episodes in the series IMO. The Children takes the cake for my favorite/the best episode in the series.
S1: Baelor

S2: Blackwater

S3: Rains of Castamere

S4: The Children

S5: Hardhome

S6: Winds of Winter

Overall: Winds of Winter (with The Children being close second) - no episode had so much stuff happening in it. Every scene was a game changer. It was beautifully directed, had a great score, it had some incredibly mindblowing moments. Perfect finish for the whole season.
Either Winds of Winter or Battle of the Bastards. Both were fantastic. 
The Children is still my favorite episode.
The Battle of the Bastards is probably the most cathartic episodes I've ever seen on TV.
The Winds Of Winter - My favorite episode of the series and of all TV shows.
Hardhome
The Watchers On The Wall.

This battle was far more terrifying than Bastardbowl - more was at stake, and the enemy was more unknown. The Night's Watch had to fight without the glory of Westeros ever knowing about it. There were more displays of bravery in this episode than any other - particularly Gren holding the gate with his homies. Blackwater, Hardhome, Bastardbowl, Winds of Winter can all kiss Watchers On The Motherfucking Wall's ass. This was the episode for me fam. 

People seem to favour whatever is in more recent memory though.
Winds of Winter might be the most climactic and tie up the most lose ends, but personally I love Hardhome
Winds of Winter might be the best episode of TV I've ever seen. 
Winds of Winter is my favourite. So much happened and it was full of reveals. And the cinematography and visual effects were epic!

The Watchers on the Wall is a close second. So much was going on and it's just insane. My favourite battle!
The latest episode was definitely up there.  Imagine living in Medieval Europe and hearing that the King's mother blew up the Church of the Holy Sepulchre or something.  Just imagining how Cercei's actions would have impacted the people of Westeros (and especially those in King's Landing) shook me up.  I have to say though, it's a toss up between that and the Battle of the Bastards.  That was just *such* a great scene.  
Battle of the Bastards
Hardhome
Winds of Winter
Watchers on the Wall
The Winds of Winter definitely for me, it had the perfect build up of tension and suspense. The score was the first time I have ever really paid attention to a musical score and wanted to know who wrote it. Last season had a load of amazing episodes though. 
Biggest wow: Hardhome, WOW close second as most of it was predictable


Best episode: BOB, however it was too predictable, they spent too long making the battle slide in Ramsay's favor when we all knew the Vale was going to come in and save them.


My personal favourite was Watchers on the Wall
As a book reader knowing about jons death and disgusted with how it actually happens, I was pretty convinced the show would do it differently, given the vast differences we had already seen. So when SHTF at Hardhome, I thought this would surely be how Jon would go out in the show, given he was not there in the books. When Jons sword met the WWs ice blade, my heart honestly stopped, as I was sure that was it for him. I was out of my seat, fists in the air when he countered for the kill. I've never felt a rush like that from any sort of medium, book movie or tv show. So Hardhome is in the lead for me, probably tied with WOW...that episode had way too many feels to not make it to the top for me. Was teary eyed for Jons TKITN scene and the TOJ reveal.
Did any other book readers feel this way while watching Hardhome?
Winds of Winter is probably the answer, but I go with Hardhome only because it came absolutely out of fucking nowhere. 
I agree with all your points, but I'm still going to have to say Battle of the Bastards just for the visceral reaction alone. 
Hardhome
For me, Hardhome. So epic, so dark, intense.
Hardhome, especially when you compare it to the books? they fucking nailed that shit. 
I would say hardhome but a couple people have already commented it. So I'll go with The Door. 
Although the last two episodes of season 6 were really great, I have always liked Hardhome. Especially the last scene where their is an epic stare down  between the Night's King and Jon. 
Hardhome hands down
I have few:

* **Baelor** - Unfortunately I got Ned's death spoiled, so that wasn't such a shock as it should be for me, but still a great episode.

* **Blackwater** - Great battle scene combined with developing some characters.

* **And Now His Watch Is Ended** - Part beyond the wall was great, but the thing that makes this episode great is Daenrys freeing Unsullied.

* **The Rains of Castamere** - Unlike ninth episode of first season, this was complete shock for me. Nothing pointed at that twist, until last 10 minutes. If I had to chose my absolute favorite episode it would be it, or most recent episode, *The Winds of Winter*.

* **The Lion and the Rose** - Joffrey died, enough said.

* **The Mountain and the Viper** - Good duel, with a twist at the very end. Stupid Oberyn. 

* **The Watchers on the Wall** - Another great battle episode and also end to the Jon/Ygritte romance.

* **The Children** - Fight between Hound and Brienne, Bren reaching his destination, Tyrion breaks out, kills his father and escapes. Great episode.

* **Hardhome** - Jorah gets exiled (again), but the main feature of this amazing episode is epic battle at Hardhome, between Free Folk with Jon and some other members of Night's Watch and White Walkers. 

* **Dance of Dragons** - Jorah comes back yet again, the Sons of the Harpy attack the stadium, Dany flies away on dragon. Kinda epic.

* **The Door** - Hodor!

* **Battle of Bastards** - Before battle, Daenerys finally defeats the Masters. Then main event of the episode starts - the epic Battle of Bastards.

* **The Winds of Winter** - Cersei blew up sept killing almost every enemy she had in King's Landing, a lot of innocent people, unintentionally made Tommen commit suicide and finally took over Iron Throne, all this with perfect soundtrack, the best in the series so far. Jon Snow was revealed to be son of Rhaegar and Lyanna and is announced as King in the North. Daenerys finally is coming to Westeros. 
S4E1:  Two Swords.

Hardhooooooome!
The Lion and the Rose

The ending is great in and of itself, but the beautiful catharsis makes this the apogee of the show's creative powers.

We not only see the machinations of the Boltons following the Red Wedding and Stannis as he burns his followers at the stake, but also Bran's vision of what is possibly coming/already happened, which sent my fanboy into fits of joy.

However, these great bits are nothing compared to the Royal Wedding. Taking up almost half the episode, the garish display of reverie and debauchery makes for a lavish background as the Lannisters make it clear to everyone who's watching that they won the War of the Five Kings.

As Joffrey continues to drink and treat everyone like they are beneath him, his antagonism towards Tyrion reveals what the War cost everyone. The mock-play even takes it a step further, rubbing salt deeply into the wounds of those who lost their loved ones.

His death, however, makes it very clear that the Lannisters will not know peace for what they have done.

A very thrilling way to set the tone for the fourth season, and, indeed, it represents a notable point for the series to begin laying the foundations for the next few seasons.
Hardhome, BotB, and The Winds of Winter are the best episodes this show has put out, from a completeness point of view.
OP, your standards for Best Episode seem to be those relating to culmination of plot points. IF that is true, then Winds has a lot. a real lot. but its not the best. 

I think the best one is Battle of the Bastards, followed by Hardholme. To me, the episode itself must tell a story. Both visually and art-wise. 

And thats what they do.

Ned's chapters are riddled with hints of Jon's parentage. I mean just wait until you get to the fever dream chapter.
I've been noticing this too. Started my reread a week ago and now I just see a bunch of stuff alluding to future events. 
People who believe R+L=J & D often point to Ned's chapters in AGOT to back up the theory. If it turns out to be true, that'll be something "obvious" that everyone missed.
Aren't all secrets deemed as safer, or in some way beneficial to the secret-keeper to keep hidden?  That's what a secret is, no? Or am I dumb?  I'm counting on reddit to let me know I am.  You've never let me down.
I've been of the theory that Tyrion Lannister could be the third head of the dragon. In the books, he's described as having white blond hair, much lighter than the golden curls of his twin siblings. Also the hatred his father has for him - could it be more than his dwarfism and mother's death that Tywin despised all these years? Not to mention his particular fascination for dragons... 

I feel like the last season of the show has hinted as well, in the general line of his story arc, but I cannot think of examples right now.

The crannogmen are disliked/distrusted by everyone, even the other Northerners think they're a bit of an odd bunch. They fight using nets, poison, and guerrilla warfare tactics, which others think are cowardly and/or improper ways of fighting. They live in a swamp, which they almost never leave. They are believed by many to be the product of interbreeding between the First Men and the Children of the Forest, which makes people suspicious of them. Their noble houses are relatively poor, and they have no castles except Greywater Watch, which isn't really much of a castle either; it's basically a big wooden motte-and-bailey hut, and there are no maesters there (which means no communication with the rest of the world, another thing people find suspicious), nor knights, nor men-at-arms. They have no legendary figures or heroes (other than the Knight of the Laughing Tree, who is suspected by some to maybe have been a crannogman, but he was just a mystery knight who fought in 1 tourney, and it's very possibly that he wasn't a crannogman at all). They eat frogs, which people consider weird. They're small in stature and live relatively primitive lifestyles. 

They're generally looked down upon by the rest of the Seven Kingdoms, even the rest of the North thinks they're a bit weird (except the Starks, to whom they are fiercely loyal, despite being very unwilling to leave their swamps for anything; other than Jojen and Meera coming to Bran's aid, and Howland Reed accompanying Ned to the Tower of Joy and saving his life, there is very little account of crannogmen ever leaving the Neck). 
It's because they're a cowardly lot of frog-eating bog devils that rely on poison and swamp traps to protect their impoverished, inbred families from more sophisticated people such as House Frey.  
Everyone is listing purely cultural reasons for this, but it's really more simple than that. They're neighbors and as such hate each other due to age old territorial disputes. The Crannogmen control much if the Neck, and as a result, all traffic traveling North from the Twins. The Freys control the Twins and all traffic moving South from the Neck.

Border disputes and the use of unconventional tactics on the part of the Crannogmen have worn down relations between the Freys and Reeds over the centuries, resulting in serious bad blood.

The French are also taunted for eating frogs, not because of the act itself, but because of the bitter rivalry between them and England that cemented the "us and them" mentality.

They control an important area that everyone else wants.
I just started reading the books as well and its very interesting to get more background on Jojen and Meera.

It is definitely just because they are different that the Crannogmen are disliked. In history many peoples who lived in mountainous or remote regions would be looked down upon because of their different culture.

A recurring insult the Frey boys called them was frog eaters. Parallels can be seen from real life where Inuit people were seen as savages (by more "civilised" people who lived close to them) because they ate raw meat.

Another interesting point is they are most respected by the North, who themselves are seen as backwards by the likes of the Lannisters and other Southerners.

They're a poor and reclusive people who are considering to have a rather primitive way of life, in addition to fighting with 'cowardly' hit-and-run tactics and poison.

Hmmm, that last bit actually makes me wonder what the Dornish think of them. Well, those Dornish who know of them at least.
i always figured that house frey tried to conquer the neck and failed horribly multiple times.

Hard to discuss things when you're melting in the sept of baelor
I'm more confused by why Mace Tyrell had Lannister men escorting him to Braavos. Wouldn't he want his own men guarding him instead?
If the truth got out maybe people were too disgusted with him to care to talk about him..."his body was found at a brothel where he was abusing little girls, his eyes gouged out and throat cut. He got what he deserved." And since no one in KL has jurisdiction to go launch an investigation to try to levy a punishment...fuck it 

Nobody liked him, the Lannisters liked him because he did their bidding, but I doubt anybody would miss him. Plus as others have mentioned he got killed in Braavos, so for all they know he's just missing.
Nobody really cares about the Kings Guard who are not otherwise important in some other way, sure MT was a semi big background figure in the story but he was essentially just a lackey of the Lannisters.

They would have just chalked it up to someone randomly killing him, perhaps someone disgusted by his pedophilia.

And given that it happened in Bravos and not Westeross there is not a whole lot that anybody who might have cared could actually do. There is not police service for example and the Bravosi city guard (assuming there is such a thing) probably don't take kindly to investigating pedophiles deaths all that seriously.

Unless you're a Kingsgaurd from an important family,like Jaime, or exceptionally skilled, like Barristan Selmy, no one is going to care much. Meryn Trant wasn't really rated by anyone.
So good. Glorious hair.
holy. moly. spectacular 
So well done I wasn't entirely convinced this wasn't a photograph.
Looks nice

If this the yours, watch your value ranges. Parts where you use straight black have too much visual weight. If you want her face to be the focal point, you will need to lighten the inside of her ear and her right shoulder. The white values can also be a bit dangerous when you're putting them next to the almost-white background.

Beautiful 
I need to start taking art classes.
Im kind of getting tired of so much art ...
It could be a reference to the Iron Throne. Maybe if the King could see all the things around Westeros he/she could became a good King/Queen.
I've been under the impression that this was meant to foreshadow Bran warging into one of the dragons, but we'll see.

nice
I tried to convince my sister and her boyfriend to do Hallowe'en as Daenarys and Hiccup (from How To Train Your Dragon).

He was very keen on the idea. She was not.
I honestly never even saw this as a prophecy. I thought it was just a fancy way of saying "When pigs fly" or "When Hell freezes over". It does have shades of MacBeth to it, though.
You're mixing books and show. Besides horn of Joramun is not gonna be used, something else.
You're really mixing up books and show

Everything about this prophecy is summed up here

I think it will be the mountain dieing rather then the wall being crushed.

I didn't really take that as a prophecy more like her just saying how she's never going to have Drogo back.

It's understandable, Quentyn had such a heavy burden straight from the get-go. Because of Doran's master plan, Quentyn is essentially Doran's heir and from an early age was shipped off to be fostered. His duty was literally his whole life. He literally died instead of failing his home and his father
If you're up for a bit of a read you may enjoy [this analysis of Quentyn's ADWD arc](http://poorquentyn.tumblr.com/tagged/quentyn-in-adwd/chrono) (three parts, posted in chronological order). It expands quite a bit on the points being made here, is written beautifully, and the author also has a wonderful series on Tyrion's ADWD arc that I highly recommend.
It has parallels to the the war in Vietnam where young men where shipped across the world to fight in a foreign country, presumably for the honor of their home country and instead died horrible pointless deaths or were terribly injured physically and mentally (sometimes even being burnt alive like Quentyn).  

Personally, I like the idea that he is actually alive but horribly disfigured from his injuries.  His return to Dorne, empty handed and broken, would complete the character arc that GRRM seems to have started.  Even better if he feels scorned and outcast, like the soldiers returning home from Vietnam did.

Here's a [video analysis about why he might be alive.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dF7dbXuGTJY)
Oh
In the show when Tyrion frees the dragons from their chains I thought - this is Quentyn's story.  Watch your back Tyrion!
Quentyn's story arc was the one that most made me go, "...okayyyyy?" while reading. It seemed completely stupid. The plan was bad...not any where near the standard I expected from the brooding wheelchair genius of the Martell clan. It didn't feel like a grand plan, it felt like a desperate attempt at playing the game, with a flea's hair chance of success.

There are video's floating around saying that Quentyn is not only not dead but that he might have a dragon. I find the stuff pretty flimsy, like most of the ASOIAF theories, but Preston Jacobs makes it all fun.
He did for a greater purpose, which I feel would involve the Tattered Prince.

We'd find out in TWOW if it ever gets released
Yo! 

If you are confused in Quentens Quest as I am you might like this Video series.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55N8Q6OINHg&list=PLCsx_OFEYH6uvfZSfec35DXBEpvA9fpm0&index=6

Its from Preston Jacobs and it has an amazing Theorie about a dornish masterplan.
You may have realised how not only his death was confusing but his adventure in generell. Quentyn is the only MArtell never getting any aid. He knows nothing about dragons has no Ship or gold to reach Daenerys and has companions trying to slow him down.

And what is his reason of going to Daenerys anyway? An unofficel marriage pact between dead Viserys and Arienne Martell? And if Viserys should have been promised to Arienne why wouldnt they protect or hide them.

Daeny and Viserys had to live the life of beggars for what reason?

He's not dead. 
Jon is a stark to Sansa. 

She was happy about it , not jealous. (Or angry , etc) 

The "oh crap" face is because of LF's smirk , she knows Jon is in danger. 
I also noticed that and had the same thought.  

What I don't understand is if Sansa wants power, then why didn't she just take the master bedroom when Jon offered it to her?  He basically said "here you can be Lady of Winterfell, im not a Stark I can't be Lord" and she declines, but now she's going to betray him to take back power that he didn't want in the first place?  Makes no sense and would really ruin Sansa's whole story IMO, hope it doesn't play out that way
I thought this at first, but after rewatching I think her smile fades because of littlefingers smirk, not that she was disappointed with not becoming queen. In her conversation with Jon, she says she thinks of him as a Stark. 
Jesus I can't wait until Sansa proves all haters wrong. She's not going to betray Jon. 
I thought that too! At first. But then I read the internet and it informed me that she was smirking until she glanced at Little Finger and saw him smirking. Then she was serious face.  

That seems right to me...but she was so weird last season. Secretive, not being totally honest with family when she finally found them again...that weird Littlefingerness with the battle and the fact that Brienne didn't just kill him and she told Brienne to hush about it...it's all way more subversive than we expect from a Stark. 

NOT THIS AGAIN
Jon looked back at her to gauge her reaction immediately after standing up, and she smiled at him. Even after he looked away again, we see in the next close up that Sansa is still smiling. And earlier in the episode they made up and both apologized, with Sansa saying that Jon is a Stark to her.

She only frowns when Littlefinger glares at her, since she knows that this event is detrimental to his plan and he will probably cause problems for them.
Sansa knows exactly what Littlefinger is like. Making her marry a lunatic like Ramsay, and all the other shit he's done to her. She said that she was a silly little girl who only ever thought about what *she* wanted when she was young, but not anymore. Now that she has Jon back, she just simply cannot betray him. It's going to destroy what little character development she has finally earned. She doesn't care if Jon is King in the North, she's not as good a tactician as Jon is, or a fighter for that matter. I think she'll be happy with being the Lady of Winterfell, and will let Jon do the rest. IF she was still a ''silly little girl'' like in the first season, then for sure she'd probably betray Jon in a heartbeat. But she isn't, she realised how foolish she was back then, so there's no way she's going to get pissy with Jon.

Also, the only thing Sansa doesnt know about regarding Littlefinger is the fact he was the ultimate cause of her father's death and the stepping stones for the Stark's downfall. I expect she'll learn about this sometime next season, and then shit hits the fan. It damn well better.
She is smiling the entire time until she sees LF an realizes she may have fucked Winterfell and Jon over. I fucking hate this theory (no offense). We are in the final stretch, they are not going to have the Starks of all families have an internal battle right now...
I would love to see Brienne cut down Littlefinger so Jon and Sansa can live happily ever after. 
I might be wrong (I haven't seen the clip in a while), but I'm certain I saw Sansa smiling at Jon when he was being declared King in The North.
I actually had a theory that after the godswood scene with LF, Sansa laid behind the scenes ground work with Lyanna and possibly Glover, to support jon as the new head of the Starks (she was married off/conspired to be married off to other people, so they could rule through her-  by having a safe male relative in power, she would be safer from marriage, back in winterfell, etc).  I know the actors/showrunners said other things, but I like my head-story better.
The Northern Houses except the Mormonts are patriarchies for a reason. In a feudal society, the primary function of a King or Lord is as war lord, raising the House levy, and leading from the front in battle. The South is more "civilized" and House Lords can be crippled like Doral Martell, but even Mace Tyrell felt the need to lead the Tyrell forces against Stannis and to accompany Jaimie with the Tyrell troops to stop Marjory's "walk of shame". Even the matriarchal Mormonts expect their chief female to raise and lead the House levies. Thus Sansa, a female untrained in the arts of war and combat and Bran, who is crippled, cannot lead House Stark or the North, especially in a time of violence and chaos. So when faced with the need for a leader and with Jon, an acknowledged bastard of Edard Stark, the last living male with Stark blood, who was also physically qualified and had the training and reputation as a warrior and had demonstrated the leadership characteristics prized by the Northern Houses as Lord Commander of the Night's Watch and as the Stark commander at the BoB. And when the Northern Lords acclaimed him as King in the North, they legitimized him as a Stark, which makes him Lord Stark of House Stark and Lord of Winterfell. There is nothing Sansa can do about this (nor Bran). As the daughter of House Stark, her place in life is to cement alliances, have children, raise them until they are fostered or reach the majority and then stand with them as advisors and she should have known this, especially after being betrothed to Geoffrey Baratheon to seal the alliance between Robert and Ned. Now she can also act as the senior lady of the House until Jon marries and as an advisor to her half-brother. Her availability for a political marriage is limited to the North, as in the South, in the eyes of the Faith, she is still married to Tyrion Lannister (the marriage hasn't been annulled). This means she is not available to marry Lord Robyn Arryn, which would give her the chance to maneuver LF right through the Moon Door. Sansa has gone to seeing marriage and children as her role in life to wanting something more, but unlike her sister Arya, who already had training for the hunt and war, she simply doesn't have that chance in a feudal society, even one as stresses and challenged as that of Westeros. Bran already knew that his condition kept him from being a warrior and Lord of his House. His role too, will be as an advisor, unless he finds himself fighting the Night's King with magic. Don't try to apply today's cultural and social views on things like gender to GoT, a fantasy set in a feudal society.

As far as Lord Baelish, he's got no more chance of getting support or acceptance from the Northern Lords as a snowball in Hell. His power base is currently the Vale. With Sansa not holding power in the North and no chance she ever will, he needs to get back to the Vale to keep his hands on Lord Robyn and an eye on the Council, especially as Bronz Yohn will come with him and resume his place on the Council after exceeding his personal and feudal authority by acclaiming Jon as King in the North. At this point, LF's best play is balancing between Danerys and Cersei, looking for the best deal and to create the most Chaos. 
I think she is not bothered by Jon - but she recognizes what a threat/danger Littlefinger is to her. I think she is going to string LF along and she will be his downfall. She is recognizing how the Game is played, and is starting to dip her toes in the water.

If she is smart she will use LF to help take over the south, or at least prepare it for Dany's arrival. 

I think she has become most well adjusted to the climate of the south and doesn't really want to be in the north any more.
Sansa's whole arc has been about growing away from the little girl she was. A little girl who cared about all the wrong things, like marrying the king and staying in KL. And that behavior lead to her family being slaughtered and her being Joff's slave for a long time. She married Ramsay to save her family, she called upon Littlefinger to save her family. She didn't want to do any of that. Do you really think they reverse her whole character arc this late, by having her go against her family for something that doesn't matter? She's not gonna lead the army either way, John will. 
Sophie Turner said her reaction was because Lottlefinger was right, /she got no credit for winning the battle and Jon will always get the credit. 
I think you are looking too much into this. Sansa was just happy for Jon, and unsettled by Littlefinger.    
    
I really liked her smile there. At this point there were a lot of speculations about Sansa plotting against Jon, and the genuine smile in support of Jon was a nice way to disprove those theories.

whoa i do see sansa betraying jon at some point, i never considered we have seen the genesis of that betrayal already.

I kind of think that Sansa is so institutionalized with her notions of Westerosi femininity that she doesn't see herself as a ruler.

but... she did spend a lot of time, and i kind of see Sansa's story mirroring Cersie's a little......

maybe she is more ambitious than we realize  ? ...
[A great sacrifice indeed](http://i.imgur.com/cdcdplv.png)
actually his last name is snow not stark may be she made a mistake here 
From the beginning she says "king" unless sansa has a little friend between her legs i think she assumed she was talking about jon since the beginning. Algo considering how that culture was and how much she learn in all these seasons i dont imagine her being so naive to think they would make her queen.
This is exactly what I thought but whenever I said anything about it everyone downvoted me and shot my idea down.
Idk what the smile meant and I am not going to say she would never betray Jon because I just don't know.

On other things posted, she and Jon both know/hope BrAnn is alive and when found he should/would be king in the north.
Jon is the closest thing Sansa has had to family since season one.  
It would be pretty bad writing for her to actually betray him because LF said it was a good idea.
Sansa caused much of this. 

Jon finished/rectified it. 
Jon just united the North, whether Sansa had visions of being Queen of the North or not her family being back in power is more important to her. Now that the North is united they can finish the war that Robb started and claim the North's independence from the Iron Throne.  
  
Sansa has to be smart enough to know you need a combat leader as King in the North to lead a rebellion...................meanwhile Sansa is still Jon's heir so she can find a very advantageous marriage for herself in the process.
Dont worry, Arya gotta make things right.
Sansa's too smart to betray Jon for a man like Littlefinger after EVERYTHING she has been through because of him. If she does turn against him for Baelish it would be utterly moronic of her. 
I love how people always assume its because she's going to betray Jon.

No, its just because she remembers the last time a Stark marched south declaring themselves king. If I were her, I'd also be cautious.
Don't pretend to ask a question when you entire goal is to get views on your video.
He was a younger son of a northern noble family.  It's what they did.  They say in the show "Starks have manned the wall for hundreds of years."
Probably because he was the youngest son of his family and so he didn't really have any prospects. 
It does seem to be a thing that younger sons  especially Starks, do. But I wouldn't think it's so usual when there's only 2 brothers, and the family could easily grant him lands and a holdfast (like Ned had as an option for Bran). Ned only had one legitimate baby son when Benjen joined the NW. Seems a bit risky for a family like that, to assume that nothing will happen to Ned or Robb. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell after all.
I personally believe that he joined the watch out of guilt.That he knew the truth about lyana and rhagear and kept quiet to protect his sister but it resulted in his fathers and brothers death.So the only honourable path left to him would be to join the watch.

But we dont know how long he was in the watch.If it was 14-15 years my theory makes sense.If not then he joined because its an honourable calling.I personally lean to the more it was the only path left to him as he was the heir to winterfell potentially,and at the very minimum he could of married a female northern heir such as lady dustin or someone in the south who needs binding to the crown.

In feudal society, land was the basis of wealth. "King of France" meant you owned the lands known as France (about one-third of what is today considered France). Your vassals held their lands from your hands and at your will. As time went on, the power of wealth allowed some vassals to become as powerful, even more powerful than their liege lords or powerful enough to threaten the Throne. The result was that land (and titles) became hereditary, though vassals still pledged their fealty to the King or Lord when they inherited the lands. In some feudal cultures, the lands were split among the brothers, such as at Charlemagne's death, though the title remained with the senior brother. In some, they went to the elder brother with the title. In such cases, younger sons had limited prospects. Stay at home and live at the benefice of their elder brother and serve as household knights and commanders, join a crusade or conquest like the First Crusade or the crusades in the Baltic or William of Normandy's invasion and conquest of England to conquer new lands or become a vassal of a more powerful lord or join a holy order or the Church hierarchy. The more powerful the House the higher in the hierarchy the younger son starts. 
So with Ned inheriting the title of Lord Stark of House Stark and the lands thereof, Benjen could do one of the three, which is why he joined the Knight's Watch.
women manage and they don't have penises. *use your imagination*
Eunuchs usually are only castrated by losing the testicles, not the penis.  Strangely, eunuchs in the middle ages were valued by society women b/c 1) they could not get pregnant with them and 2) strangely, or counter-intuitively, they could keep their erections longer than fully intact men.  This is a fact.  Some families would castrate their sons in hopes they would become a castrato and make good money as a singer, although obviously not all castrated could sing that good.  But a castrato would also mix among society women and be very popular due to their sexual abilities and b/c they could not sire a child, no need for birth control.
Honestly just Google it, eunuchs aren't really specific to Game of Thrones and there were plenty in world history.

Hello darkness... my old friend 
Just figured I would lighten up the sub with a bit of fun.  Being between seasons is a tough time.  Enjoy this silliness. :)
Nice, absolutely perfect. Love it when the cover sounds even better than the original.
My cats are not happy right now.
Reminded me of this gem: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yY98VC4O4Q
That was so bad I think it gave me cancer!   They many off notes and notes between notes and I think my cat drowned itself about 20 seconds in to end the pain.  When will the recorder be outlawed? When?  
Is it cover? wow! Sounds like the original!

Subscribed to the channel within the first 30 seconds of that video. Hilarious.
Ramsay says Stannis's men will be a "feast for the crows".
The hound pisses in the river lady stoneheart was supposed to come out of.
in the show when Arya is in Braavos selling clams she goes by the name of Lana. At one point she says "i walk the canals" right as a cat runs by
When Tyrion says "It seems this saga will never be completed" he is referencing GRRM's inability to finish the books.
Shireen is reading a book called dance of dragons, about a targaryan war.
When Bronn, Pod, and Tyrion are meeting the Dornish Bannermen in the show and discussing the different banners, Bronn comment "I need me one of those, now that I'm a knight" or something like that. Referencing how in the books Bronn picked a banner for himself but it was never mentioned/brought up in the show.
The mummers show in Bravos that Arya watches mentions The Winds Of Winter...
In the books a northern Lord makes 3  freys into 3 giant pies (northerns really hate the freys and Boltons in the books)

Arya puting a couple of freys in pies was probably a reference.

There's no in-universe justification for it, but the actual reason is probably re-shoots. You can imagine how ridiculous it would be for the prop department to create a ton of breakable seals for every take of a scene. It's not really a gamebreaker but it does require a bit more willing suspension of disbelief.
I came here expecting some weird seal conspiracy theory :(

http://i.imgur.com/Ui19C9o.jpg

You got a point there though
Seals were not a security device, they were a method of verification in a time of limited literacy. Secured documents would be placed in locked containers and transferred by armed couriers. Important documents like contracts would be cut in an irregular zig-zag which would result in the two copies or parts of document being difficult to replicate. Especially sensitive documents would be encrypted with simple cyphers. But a written document in a society with limited literacy is fairly secure. Finally, back to the wax seals, in a feudal society, even kings were often barely literate and seals were a means of signing and verifying a document.

Seems soo stupid haha. Only thing I could think of to justify this in my head is that when they pull off the "rubber band" with the seal on it, the seal will crack/break and not stay perfect. 
If you think this has a happy ending you haven't been paying attention
"Ser Jaime Lord commander of the nights watch"

I seriously doubt there will be a night's watch or a wall at the end of the story. The final war will be against the WW and their army, and after that, there will be no need for a wall, as one of the sides are defeated.
I feel like it's still too early to start predicting the very end.  I've been confident that Dany will sit the Iron Throne since the first season but the series has had so many twists that I can't help but wonder.  She's got some pretty serious plot armor at this point.  If she goes, her dragons will probably go first, and those dragons seem pretty important to the whole White Walker conflict.  I'm still pretty sure she's going to wind up on top in the end, but I think Cersei is going to hold out for quite a while.  She's in some pretty dire straits right now but she's one hell of a player.  

I think Jon will remain King in the North, where he can keep an eye on The Wall and make sure the gates don't close on the Free Folk again.  They're never going to bend the knee to whoever winds up on the Iron Throne but that isn't a problem they'll have with Jon.  I think he'll stay in the North and I think Dany will let him.  Samwell will be Maester for the Night's Watch, there's no getting out of that.  Jon wouldn't let him leave The Wall even if they both wanted this outcome.

Arya will die unless she gives up this assassin lifestyle.  The Mountain will die in Cleganebowl.  Would be a shame if Jaime didn't return to Casterly Rock and further the Lannister name, but this show loves drawing parallels with historical events and the Lancasters more or less went extinct at the end of the War of the Roses, so you're probably right.  He'll wind up keeping his white cloak or exchanging it for a black one.  If he *does* go to the wall and Jorah finds his cure, I don't see any reason for him to wind up on the wall too.  Dany has clearly forgiven him at this point.  As Varys as stated before, "the storms come and go, the big fish eat the little fish, and I keep on paddling."  The Spider will always be The Spider.  

If Tormund doesn't get Brienne, I'm going to be *pissed.*
I don't care just as long as no more doggies die </3
#4 - I actually wondered this season if there was a future for Brienne and the Hound.  I rewatched his scenes when he talked about being beaten by a woman, and I couldn't tell if there was a shame or pride in how he said it.  

My main thought on this series (has been for a few years now) as a book reader and fan of the adaptation is Jon and Dany both die but have a child, mirroring their story with Rhaegar and Lyanna. Sansa takes the role of Ned 2.0 and raises and protects it. What's old is new, time is a flat circle.

If you go with the more somewhat upbeat ending than my prediction is: Jon Snow Iron Throne, Daenerys dead, Sansa Wardness of the North, Tyrion Hand of the King, Bran Master of Whisperers, Sam Grand Maester, Brienne Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, Davos back to his wife to live out his days, Arya travels West, The Hound Kingsguard, Podrick Kingsguard, Tormund Lord of a new House created by Jon Snow.

All men must die
1. I think Dany and Jon will be a couple because Targaryens love family weddings. 
2. I also think Jon will kill Arya to become Azor Ahai, though by accident because Arya shape/face lifted into someone. I really don't hope so but he has to kill someone he loves and he was ofcourse always very close with Arya.. 
3. I doubt if Jaime survies, what if Bran decides to visit his own accident back in time and remembers/sees everything? 
4. Littlefinger and Robyn won't make it I think, hopefully Robyn is Peters son and the Vale will find out.
5. GrandMaester Samwell.
6. The hound and all the brotherhood without banners die because right now they are still alive 'for a reason'. I think they will play a big role in beating the WW but won't survive because they did what they were still alive for.
7. Jorah will visit old Valerya to find the cure and finds secrets into forging Valeryan steel or other secrets Valerya still holds. I'm not sure how he will get that information to westeros though.
8. Bronn dies? I don't think he will get along with someone like Jon but Dany seems to welcome sellswords and he is an old friend of Tyrion. Might also be some sort of kingsguard, more like the Hound was.

Curious what you think.
You messed up 9. Gendry will be on his 1281st row around Dragonstone.
King: Jon Snow
Hand: Davos
Coin: Missandei
Ships: Tormund
Law: Tyrion
Whispers: Varys
Grand Maester: Sam
Lord Commander of the Kings Guard: Jorah
Kings Guard: Hound/Brienne/Podrick/GreyWorm/Bronn +1 character introduced in S7/S8
Warden of North: Bran (also lord of winterfell)
Warden of East: Sansa
Warden of West: Jaime (also lord of casterly rock)
Warden of the South: Gendry (also lord of stormlands and married to Arya)
Lord of Pyke: Theon
How? Dany goes mad, more level headed followers go to Jons side after Jorah kills Dany with Longclaw. Jon takes the throne with both his and Danys subjects on his council, the wardens otherwise being the most obvious choices (Sansas a bit of a stretch but her history with LF and Sweet Robin makes it plausible to me)
There no way we can predict every single ending of each character, some are obvious others are your going to be completely different than you expect. However, my thoughts on the ending is that it is going to be a huge twist. George R.R. Martin has already said the ending will be "bitter sweet", I think he meas that the ending will not be as expected and one of the major characters doesn't end up on the iron throne but we'll be happy about the person on the Iron Throne.

This could end in many different ways, for example Daenerys Targaryen could end up dying and Jon Snow ends up sitting on the Iron Throne. This sounds like a good ending for the series as throughout the series we have seen the most brutal things happen to the Stark and it would be sweet for us to see the ending as the Stark's finally came out on top, but it doesn't seem very much like game of thrones. 

I think Jon Snow will end up ruling in some fashion, he is the humble King who never wanted to be King, and he is the only one who can lead them through the Long Night. Who better to be King than the person who saved the Kingdom. 

Or maybe the foreigner who sort of had a blood-right 3 Kings and 1 Queen ago?
I think there'll be something about time collapsing on itself and none of it ever having happened. We've already seen weird time shit going on with Bran, and I don't think they're finished with the idea. Maybe he'll erase history somehow because of what a nightmare living in that world has been/may continue to be. Bran and his powers are going to factor in, and I think it'll serve more of a purpose than just proving Jon Snow's parentage. This show has so many contrasting elements that I could certainly see there emerging a Bran the Destroyer to contrast with Bran the Builder.
The only thing I'm certain of is that Jon will be King of Westeros and Tyrion will be his hand. Everything else is fair game.
Either Jon or Dany won't make it out alive.

Other characters that seem slightly doomed are:  Bran (the power being too much for him), Theon (he's a shell of a man destined to redeem himself with his own death), at least one Stark girl, and at least one probably both Lannister Twins.

Varys, Sam, Tyrion seem to be the most likely candidates to survive.
I'm only on season one so I think Ned will be king idk about the rest I'll update you guys as I get further
My theory - Littlefinger and Varys rule as two kings.  
Here is mine:

1.  The Iron Throne is no more.  Seven Kingdoms break up.
2.  Dany dies at or north of the wall to help stop the White Walkers. 
4.  Jon becomes King of the Wildlings.  Brokers a peace between Man and White Walkers.
5.  Wildlings and former Night's Watch merge to rule a new buffer between the lands of men and the far north.
6.  Sansa is Queen of the North.  She kills Littlefinger and marrys Sweetrobin.
7.  Tyrells are wiped out.  The Tarly's take over The Reach.  Lord Tarly dies.  
8.  On his own deathbed, Dickon legitimizes Samwell, who becomes King of The Reach.
9.  Arya sails west (possibly with Nymeria) to see what is on the other side of the Sunset Sea.
10.  Cersei dies at Winterfell.  Bran wargs into The Mountain and chokes her to death (fulfilling valonquar prophesy).
Dany must die. 
1. Dany - Dead
2. Jon - on Iron Throne
3. Tyrion - Hand of the King
4. Davos - Retired
5. Sansa  - Lady of Winterfell and Warden of the North
6. Bran - becomes a white walker
7. Arya - dead (maybe she kills way too many people and Jon has to deal with her)
8. Jon and Dany's Child will inherit the Throne
9. Sam - serving Jon in KL in some capacity 
10. Jorah - rebuilds the nights watch
11. Brienne - Dead
12. Meera - Goes home
13. Ghost - Dead
14. Nymeria - Arya wargs into Nymeria when she dies. She is Free.
15. Cersei - Dead
16. Jamie - Serving Jon in KL
17. Tormund - Lord of the Dreadfort
It sounds like a too much of a good ending. I respect your opinion but definitely some points will be different.

* For sure Jon and Dany will not be King and Queen at the end. One or both will die.

* Jaime will die too in the arms of women he loves...Brienne.

* Gendry and Arya will marry as Ned said she should marry Lord and rule his castle. Also, that Robert wanted his son and Ned's daughter to marry. Joffrey and Sansa. It will be Arya and Gendry.

* Sam will be Lord Tarly or Master in King's Landing.

* Jorah will die too against white walkers, some sort of sacrifice.

* Tyrion could serve as Hand of the Queen and King. Will be Lord of Casterly Rock.

* Cersei, Mountain, Bronn and bunch of other characters will die.

* Theon will be ruler of Iron Islands.

* Ser Davos hopefully will live in Essos or somewhere but I can see him dying.

* Sansa will be new political player and ruling the North.
Expecting big things for Sansa I see
Somebody important will die. Tyrion, Davos, Jamie, Cersei, Littlefinger..............one of them will die because this is Game of Thrones
I think Jaime would die before he joins the Nights Watch. 
Well let's see. First of all this ending is way too happy. I think a lot more people will die. Now according to the original draft, that is already drastically different from what we have, 5 people will survive: Jon, Dany, Tyrion, Arya and Bran

1. I am not too sure about where Jon and Dany end up. They could end up marrying, or maybe not. I am of the belief that there will be no throne to sit on by the end of the series.

2. Yeah, Tyrion will be close to Dany, probably serve as the Hand or something.

3. I think Davos will die. Probably close to the end, maybe in the final battle.

4. Brienne might die protecting Sansa or someone, Hound will probably completely change his life again or he will die during Cleganebowl.

5. Varys might die too, if not he'll be something like what he is right now. Spymaster basically.

6. Littlefinger definitely dies.

7. Jaime will probably die. Depending on how his relationship with Cersei (who'll probably die in the beginning of next season) ends up, he could either kill her and then kill himself, or die fighting for her, or join the other side. I think Tyrion might save him in some way. Who knows.

8. Yeah, Arya is a tough one. I really, really want her to survive, but I have a feeling she might die near the end. She'll definitely not become ruler of Storm's End. I don't even think she will end up with Gendry (who might become ruler of Stormlands). So Arya could either die, or do what she said to the actress, go and find out what's west of Westeros. Seeing her sailing off on a boat towards the sunset would be a great ending, but this is GoT.

9. I think Bran will turn into a tree wizard or something. I definitely don't see him ruling anything or building a wall. Meera might die.

10. Bronn will die.

11. Sam could become Master of the Citadel or something of that sort. Or Winterfell maester. I don't think he will die. 

12. Don't know about Royce.

13. I think Jorah will die, protecting Dany or something. Like an ultimate sacrifice sort of thing.

14. Sansa is a tough one. If Jon becomes king, she might become Warden of the North or Queen in the North. I think she'll live.

15. Cersei dies next seas, Mountain probably too, Theon probably too. Not sure what happens with Yara, probably Lady of Iron Islands after they kill Euron.
I think that Cersei don't die final. 
Danny will be queen of seven kingdom 
sersei Will give birth to the child and run off the free cities
Jon dead final  battle with night king
Raegal and Viserion dead. Only Drogon left with Danny 
The dragons will melt the Wall and then the White Walkers will come and kill everyone and destroy the Iron Throne.
Here is my predicitons:

1. I think Jon with both White Walker and humans sides having heavy casualties will make peace with the white walkers and he will become there new Night King and lead them away from hummanity
2. Jorah is revealed to be Azor Ahai and sacrifiaces Daenerys and destroys some of the white walkers but obvoiusly not all of them and he becomes head of the kingsguard
3. Jon leaves in his will that if anything is to happen to him that Sansa is cronwed queen of Westeros and Sansa is crowned queen possibly baring his child.
4. Tyrion is made lord of Casterly Rock
5. Samwell is Sansa's maester
6. Arya is either dead or hand of the queen (if she dies some other random noble would be hand)
7. Bran goes beyond the wall to become the new three eyed raven
8. Lyanna mormont becomes queen of the north
9. Rhaegal is the last remaining dragon and Viserion and Drogon are dead
10. Edmure becomes lord of the the Riverlands
11. Gendry is Lord of Storm's end and if Arya lives is betrothed to her.
12. Yara is queen of iron Islands and Mistress of Ships
13. Varys becomes master of Whispers again
14. Brienne is made commander of the city watch
15. Davos, Theon, Bronn, Jaime, The Hound, Thoros, Cersei, Euron, Grey Worm, Illyrio, Meera, Robin, and Royce all dead.
16. Timmet lord of the vale. 
I now think Dany will have the Throne and Jon will die. I was watching the vision of the throne room again and I cant get the image of Snow falling on Kings Landing, I think it means Snow will fall at Kings Landing. I think everyone will die mostly, she will have the Throne but she will be alone.
Too many "alive" people for my liking.
Daenerys Targaryen is Azor Ahay 

1. Jon - Lord of Winterfell
2. Dany - Dead, reunites with Drogo
3. Sansa - Queen of the Seven Kingdoms
4. Brienne - Commander of the Queensguard
5. Cersei - Killed by Jamie
6. Jamie - Killed by Cersei
7. Tyrion - Hand of the Queen
8. Arya - Professional 'cleaner'.
9. Theon - Death by suicide
10. The Hound - Kicks ass then becomes a farmer 
11. The Mountain - Killed by The Hound (HYPE)
12. Varys - Still doing whatever he does
13. Bran - Builds the wall and lives in a treehouse
14. Night's King - Turned human again and killed
15. Olenna - Killed by Cersei
16. Sand Snakes - Who cares
17. Bron - Lord of a minor house
18. Tormund - Moves to King's Landing to stalk Brienne
19. Pod - A Hero Knight 
20. Davos - Stays in Winterfell
21. Gendry - Still rowing
22. Euron - Dead, doesn't come back harder or stronger
23. Melisandre - Dead
24. Yara - Dead
25. Meera - Dead
26. Jorah - Dead
26. Littlefinger - Executed by the Starks, reanimated and then executed again

Sam - With Gilly and the wee baby by his side,  sits down and begins documenting the events that have taken place since Jon Aryn was murdered.

He takes his time.
Yeah, no. *Maybe* 3 of these people will survive. 

Jamie will die, likely with Cersei (probably while killing her).

Tyrion will die. He may be the last to die, but he will. I almost guarantee it more than anyone else. Because we love him so much. But he should die well. 

Speculating on the small council seems pointless. If there are enough people left alive, a monarchy seems unlikely (Dany: I will break the wheel)

Hound will die (probably heroically also)

Illyrio will die (I'm guessing of natural causes (from just being a general fat shit))

Arya may live. 

I see Sam pleading his case to the maesters, them not responding, and him taking it into his own hands. Then dying. 

Sansa dead. Maybe sacrificing herself to take someone out. 

Bran seems too powerful to survive the new world order. 

Dany and Jon. I see them both surviving. 

Euron, Mountain, Martells, Greyjoys, Tullys, and Tyrells all dead. 

Lots of our Favorite characters are dead (I'm predicting Jaime, Davos and Daenerys).

Kings landing is destroyed, instead The have a king in the south, king in the north, king in the west and king in the east. The north, south, east and west all being independent nations.
-Jon and Dani hook up, either romantically or just politically.

-Shit goes down, Jon kills Dani and his sword lights on fire process. If anyone can produce a flaming sword from their death, it's Dani. Azhor Ahai blah blah blah...

-Jon realizes he has to sacrifice himself to become the new Night's King, makes the WWs retreat north in some pact, saves humans and sets this all up to happen again in 5-10k years. Maybe they're have gun next time. 

-If there anything like the Night's Watch left, Jorah will probably be in charge of it at the end. Probably with a fire arm. 
Dany will not survive. 

Gendry will rule but he will not be a king.  He will be some form of elected high official.   He and Arya marry. 

Brienne will die protecting Jaime somehow.  This will compel Jaime to complete his journey to being a fully fledged good person. 

Jaime will die protecting Sansa in order to fulfil Brienne's oath and to try and make up for the harm the Lannisters have caused her and her family. He dies with honor and he will be buried with honor. 

Jon ranges north of where the wall used to be and is never officially seen again.  There will be possible sightings but nothing certain. 

Davos will be whatever the Hand of the king ends up being called.  Gendry' s right hand man. 

Cersei will be dead

Euron dead. 

Theon dead but mostly redeemed. 

Sam Tarly will be a Grand Maester for Gendry. 

Bran will live and rule the North.  He will lose all of his 3 eyed raven mojo though. 

Dragons will all be dead. 

White Walkers will all die or transform back to people.  Not the wights.  They will just crumble. 

Magic will leave the realm forever when the dragons die and the white walkers are defeated.   

Mel will die by suddenly aging 300 or so years. 

The Hound will destroy Zombie Mountain.  He will be injured and may die.  If he lives, he will become a wandering preacher. Not for any gods but for humanity and that it is never too late to change. 

Tyrion will be given Casterly Rock. He will travel Westoros talking to the people and trying to make improvements. 

Jorah will go back to bear island and live his life alone burdened that he could not save Dany. 


I have a weird idea.

I think that Jon is going to fall in love with sansa, he clearly cares for her and she cares for him.

He is going to discover he is Son of rhaegar but that doesn't matter he is happy being king and queen with sansa. he is thought of as a bastard so it wouldn't be *that* fucked up if him and sansa hook up i think, also him winning the battle and becoming king of the north should be enough for him to get what he wants.


In this process jon hears about Danny and wants to seek and accord to be able to help take the 7 kingdoms if he she helps him take down the white walkers. Dany needs jon's land and forces so she agrees on the position of marriage, jon accepts in order to beat the white walkers. 

After bloody conflicts against cersei they finally win, probably losing Davos or other key members such as jamie killing cersay and then taking his own life...he has lost everything at this point.  

The celebration is short lived, bran finds away to get past the wall, from help of Jon's friend and new lord commander. They prove they are not undead and send a warning. 

The second bran steps through/over the wall the magic touch of the Knights king activates destabilizing the whole wall. The chekhov's gun Jon left on the table about "not letting the wall fall down" fires and the wall does come down destroying most of the knights watch and gives an easy way for the White walkers to invade and destroy the kingdoms. 

after this the Knight's king mobilizes his forces and it is probably here we see Brandon stark's last stand against the white walkers and he dies by the hand of the Knight's king himself. 

bran and the other survivors escape to winterfell where sansa is ruling in jon's stead.


Close on their tail though is the newly dead former knights watch freshly turned since the protective magic from the wall is gone. 

Winterfell has very little forces since most of them were sent to the war effort in the 7 kingdoms.

Sansa does not want to flee her ancestral home but her bannermen and women force her to leave and to "distract" the dead long enough to make her escape, winterfell is gone. 


Jon and dany finally making their marriage official as queen and king of The 7 kingdoms the news is cut short but Sansa and bran and a few other survivors perhaps from the wall. 

They alert the new king and queen that the wall has fallen and then dead come to invade. 


Jon goes to the war room with his most trusted advisors and his true love sansa, as well as his queen Danny and her hand of the queen tyrion. They discuss plans on how to fight this and this is where bran drops the truth that Jon is rhaegar's son. 

This shocks everyone but it makes no sense to lie about this while he is already king, there is nothing more to gain. This reminds maybe tyrion or some other book reader of the prophecy and azura ahai with his burning sword. 


Jon is torn and takes a long recces and Sansa comes to comfort him, she then tells him while they are embracing that she will do anything for him and what is the best for her people. 

Jon heartbroken and sad plunges his valyrian steel in sansa killing her but igniting the sword as lightbringer and solidifying himsel as azura ahai. (also this kinda makes sense with the whole song of fire and ice, sansa ice brings about fire the flaming sword lightbringer.


I already rambled long enough, the series ends with Jon taking the fight to them with Dany and him on dragon back with tyrion on the other (3 heads of the dragon) and i expect tough losses. Dany for sure i see dying with at least one of her dragons maybe even tyrion.

The story ends with Jon on the iron throne all alone, the seat of power he never wanted knowing what he did saved the realm of man and beast alike but at the cost of all his loved ones including his beloved at his own hand. 



TL:dr shit gets fucked./


I like writing and this is just shit i thought of on the top of my head that kinda makes sense, so please don't yell at me "oh blah blah Jon would never love sansa like that" i just liked the general idea i thought of and made things where it could make sense. 

i got rather ramble'y but i would love to hear what other people think of my thoughts.

Dany and Jon surviving  that's not happening  I find that hard to believe Jon already died so even if he dies at the end  first it will be danys turn , danys storyline  if you really think about has become full circle she will die at hands of someone she loves and who will betray her and her death will be sooner than later all clues point to Jon but GM may surprise us and may be someone different someone who we don't suspect danys legacy will be her dragons by leaving them behind or two of them they will help the other only Targaryen alive (Jon) defeat the WW

What happens to rest of them anything can happen but I believe in the end a stark and a Targaryen will bring storyline to a close brining the story full circle ending with a union.just like Lyanna and rhaegor .
Jon, Arya, Cersei, Jaime & Daenerys: I think they're going to die: Arya by suicide; Jon and Daenerys fighting the others; I'm not sure how Cersei and Jaime will die but it would be fitting if they were born together, lived together, ruled together and then finally died together


Sansa: ruling from Winterfell or the Iron Throne (although I consider the latter unlikely since Sophie does not seem to be a part of the major King's Landing scenes in season 7). I suppose Brienne could remain by her side but I find that unlikely

Tyrion: Hand of whomever ends up sitting the Iron Throne and/or Lord of Casterly Rock

Bran and Samwell: I really have no idea what since their roles in the series are still mostly unclear to me. I don't see them being in any situations where they could die but don't see where they'd be in the aftermath if they make it.
Jon bends the knee to Dany while he marries Sansa and impregnating Dany. Another GoT-esque thing will happen.
Hound and Arya get married and bring about a new definition of wolves of stark. Gendry/Edrick getting Storm's End as a gift from Dany. Jaime get's his other hand chopped and is now the handless knight. Tyrion accidentally drinks wildfire and confirms that he really is a dragon. Brienne and Tormund get a love child. In the end they all sit in a table and get killed by Bran because he is now seeking revenge because he got forgotten so they all turn to hodor in the end.


tl;dr They're all fucked
You need to leave two spaces for line breaks. Here:

* Euron (killed by Yara) 

* Theon (killed by Euron) 

* Missendei (poisoned by Euron) 

* Beric Dondarrion (killed by a white walker) 
 
* Daario (sneaked on one of Dany's ships and burned alive by one of her dragons) 

* The Mountain (killed by the hound) 

* The Hound (killed by the mountain) 

* Brienne (dies defending Jon in the battle for King's Landing) 

* Bronn (dies in the battle) 

* Melisandre (killed by Arya) 

* Edd (the wall falls on him) 

* The Sand Snakes (All three killed in battle) 
 
* Ellaria Sand (Poisoned by Tyrion for Myrcella) 

* Davos (dies in battle) 

* Arya (dies in a bed of blood after being very wounded by Cersei) 

* Cersei (Killed by Jaime) 
 
* Viserion (killed somehow with wildfire) 
 
* IIlyn Payne (killed in battle) 
 
* Olenna (dies of old age) 
 
* Littlefinger (poisoned by Sansa) 
 
* Qyburn (burned alive by a dragon)
cool Sansa lives

I agree with a few of yours:


Euron (Killed by Yara)


Theon (Killed by Euron)


Daario, who I'd like to be Victarion in the show (Killed by Theon)


Edd (Night king/Wall related incident)


Cersei (Killed by Jaime, not sure if she'll die season 8 though, I personally want her to die at the end)


Mountain (Killed by hound I think, but I really want him to be killed by Obara)


Olenna (Poisoned by one of Cersei's henchmen)


Littlefinger (Outmanipulated by Sansa or Yohn Royce, or straight up killed by Arya)


Thoros (Killed by Arya)


Arya (Killed by Thoros but then revived by Beric)


Beric (Gives his life for Arya, making her show version LSH)


Bronn (Burnt to death by a dragon, but has an emotional death scene with Tyrion)


Benjen (Dies to some WW or nights king, maybe Benjen gets a good hit or takes off his arm or something)


Nymeria (Killed by Euron)


Elleria (Killed by Jaime)


Robert Arryn (Littlefinger? IDK but after everyone that's died, surely this kid can't outlast them all)


Qyburn (Somehow dies, dragon? Grey worm?)


Randyll Tarly (Killed by Sam)



cousin dangereux
Don't get too excited Sophie - he's got a tiny pecker, according to Tormund.
It seems to Me that Sophie always just goes along with whatever the question asks. After season six ended she gave interviews that were going along with the idea that Jon and Sansa are going to be against each other. She just says what the reporter wants her to say because she can't say anything real. 
wow blonde hair looks really good on her!
[removed]
Season premier: Jon falls from a tower and breaks both arms. Redditors cheer, everyone else confused.
Hell, Tywin married his first cousin. Other than the whole "raised as siblings" thing, it wouldn't even be that weird.
Sansa has also in the passed overtly hinted at Sansa hooking up with Ayra and Margaery, now its Jon. Sophie Turner is just a troll.....a sexy troll.
So since no one linked the source video yet: https://youtu.be/amtakP1svhI?t=1m38s
she's gorgeous.
Is it just me or does Sophie turner always look drunk during interviews? 
[removed]
Wow she's stunning, first time not seeing her in costume.
She said the same thing about the possibility of her and Arya getting it on..."oh yeah, yeah, a girl is no one!" 
As much as I like her in red, blonde looks amazing on her. 
They didn't have the scripts by the Emmys, iirc.
One thing you have to remember about cousins, it wasn't a taboo marrying one until mid-20th century. FDR married his cousin, after all.

So marrying your cousin wouldn't even be a big deal for GoT (Tywin already did that). What would be a problem is that Jon a and Sansa always thought of each other as siblings. 
My goodness she is gorgeous.
[Source interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amtakP1svhI&feature=youtu.be&t=1m38s).

Then she goes like "No. I couldn't do that with Kit, i would laugh" and on D&D joking about them.
Littlefinger cucked by another stark! (Almost) Poor guy 
Oh please, gods no.
Lets be real. Sophie wants some of that Kit Harrington. Who the fuck wouldn't? Kit Harrington could swing a straight man to the other side. 
Jon/Sansa/Daenerys love triangle confirmed?
Can I just say she looks really fine with blonde hair. 
She's so beautiful 
[removed]
Cousins?
"cousins" 
R+L=J confirmed
[removed]
Let's get Dany in too and have a cousin aunt threesome. Targaryens are all about that. That being incestous polygamy.
hey its me ur cousin let's go bowling
Jon does like his redheads as we know 
and he is a targaryen after all. 
Maisie and her have very expressive eyes. 
She is amazzzinnnggg

She is so beautiful I wouldn't blame jon
Maybe it's just because I only read the books... but aren't they half-siblings, not cousins???
Odd she said cousin and not brother. This furthers the r+l=j theory. Maybe im behind and this is canon?
 I wonder if Game of Thrones is going to change the way our society views incest.  I mean cousins is one thing, and not even that problematic genetically, but Cersei and Jaime are siblings and a lot of people want to see them together.  Or at least they did before Cercei went crazypants.
Damn she's gotten gorgeous
I just realised, she looks a little bit like Boy George.

Except neither of them know Jon is not Ned's son, so it's still really weird.
The amount of sass in that final frame is so awesome. Totally has that look like "Oh I know something. It's juicy. And i'm not telling a soul"
lol she's pretty fucking funny.
[removed]
Wow, who is she? She looks just like Sansa, but hot...
God I love her.
So basically Shelbyville?
[removed]
She looks baked.
She's down to make out with Kit. hahah

In all seriousness though, it'd be "interesting", I guess? But it doesn't seem a very Stark thing to do. Do the Stark's have any history in their lineage of incestual relationships? 

I don't really see Sansa and Jon getting together though. Seems much more likely for Jon to not be with anyone frankly. Maybe Jon will die by the end of it all. Self-sacrifice of sorts.
george martin pls
Stupidness question here, so I'll apologize in advance, but does she wear a wig when filming as Sansa?
This gives me every reason to believe that they will NOT be romantically involved. I feel like she wouldn't talk about something that could be this much of a spoiler. 
I am in so much love with her
I reeeeeaally dont like this person. 
She lowkey wants to frickle frackle with Kit Harington. Then again, who wouldn't?
Started liking Sansa in this last season. I like her more now!
I srs can't believe this bitch is the same age as me. Shes got money and everything and Im wiping the jizz off my bed in my basement. It's like i live in a different world
Totally getting a Cameron Diaz vibe right now. 
Called this after BotB to much hostility and many down votes. Still sticking by it. 
A la prima se le arrima... 
That is some expert trolling.
she wishing
But they don't know they are cousins. They think they are half brother and sister. And yes, the Lanisters did this and that. But the Starks are not as crazy as the Lanisters. 
Need Stark is crying in afterlife right now 😂
[removed]
She is a beauty no matter what.  But I humbly think that red hair suits her complexion more than blonde. 
Anyone know the source video?
How could Jon discover about his origins?

By now,they still think he's Ned's bastard and I don't remember anyone present in his birth who could reveal this or any possibility it was registered in any book.and would they believe Bran is a clairvoyant?

I mean, the dragon does have three heads... 
Stuff and thangs
With blonde hair, she reminds me of Alexa Grace.
For a second I was confused because I forgot they are not actually brother and sister. 
4th picture looks like a troll face expression
Natalia Starr? 
Can i get a link to this interview?
this interview she also stated "this is the last season for some of us... I mean anybody"

plus I haven't really seen her or Arya on set as much. :/
so that was a jump. at the CON she almost shot Dan... 
Link on the source video?
I love when Arrested Development quotes infect a thread! 
She looks like she smokes some weed to me. Those eyes, man, those eyes.
damn she is beautiful
Goddamn she is incredibly sexy right here!
Hahaha. I think we have a huge spoiler here...
Anyways, she has sense of humor, hasn't she? ^.^
Jon Snow is the manlet who came form nothing and fucked the most beatiful women on the planet. a true hero for all manlets
Jon x Sansa scene confirmed
Funny, a few weeks/couple months ago when Sophie Turner was seemingly discrediting the idea the anti Jon/Sansa folks were taking it as surefire evidence it could never happen under any circumstance.

Wonder what they're thinking now?

To be clear, I don't think Jon/Sansa is a thing that's gonna happen (or if it does it will be under some very unusual circumstances), but I've never held with the camp that thinks it's a complete impossibility or that the setting wouldn't easily allow for it.
I might
She's turned out to be quite pretty.
Talk about a perfect nose.
Yeah but they still think they're half siblings... and GROSS!!! 
[removed]
Uhh....DID ANYONE NOTICE THAT SHE SAID "COUSINS"???????? NOT HALF SIBLINGS BUT COUSINS???? R+L=J LEGIT CONFIRMED? Or am I just late?
[deleted]
Don't wanna be "that guy", but this should be tagged for spoilers due to the mention of them being cousins and not half-siblings 
uhh they should really be coached by someone when it comes to PR.  She still is the worst character arc in both the books and the show.
She's looking like Lindsey Lohan.
Please, no. 
Fuck em. The seven is like the only religion that doesn't actually have magically powers. 
Sept not Church.

And yes, I suddenly missed Joffrey upon seeing what a coward Tommen was.

When the sparrows arrogantly told Tommen that the High Sparrow is praying and not to be disturbed, the valiant Kingsguard explicitly stated; 

> **"Give us the order and we'd send these fanatics to meet the God they love so much"**  <-------- badass line right here

What did the craven do? Run back to Margaery and tell her he can't do nothing

Joffrey would've unleashed the entire Lannister army there and then.

My most satisfying scene in the finale was when that coward plunged headfirst into the hard ground
There is nothing wrong with the dogma of the Faith. It is very similar to the baseline teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. The problem with the Faith is that it is organized religion, with a hierarchal structure and its own police force and military. This allows it to compel acceptance and conformity rather than to appeal and persuade for it. Appeal and persuasion are hard, using violence to make people accept and conform is easy. So the Faith goes to violence as a first option, transgressing its own teachings. The hierarchy becomes closed and nepotistic and hereditary and begins to look to its own power and comfort rather than the needs of the people they are supposed to be guiding and helping. The organization allows fanatics to rise to power and use that power to their own ends, as the High Sparrow was doing. His ends may have been sanctified, but his means were sinful and wrong. The Faith is also militant in its missionary work. When the Andals invaded Westeros, it was partly a "jihad", with the Andals imposing the Faith of the Seven where ever they conquered. Add to this the Faith's attempt to infiltrate and control the secular government and its power to its own purposes.

This is a pure analogy for the place and history of organized religion in the Western world. While the Faith mostly mirrors the Roman Catholic Church with its hierarchy, dogma, militancy (Benedictines and Cistercians, the Inquisition), militant orders (Templars, Hispitalers) and predilection for infiltrating, allying with and dominating governments, such as its relationship with the monarchies of France and Spain, or the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Papal States or even the Irish Republic (the Church runs the government's education system). 

It is also an analogy for what happens when the boundaries between church and state blur or disappear.

So regarding the church, while I don't disagree, it is worth noting that we approach their interactions from the perspective of the nobility.  We are made to follow Margery and Cersei into the political arena, and both of them were specifically targeted by the high sparrow.  Even outside this outrage, they have the most to loose by an empowered church and are those whose privileges are being specifically targeted by the zealots.

In some case, this targeting isn't even for terrible reasons- pretty much the entire nobility claims worships the seven pretty impiously, and their abandonment of those virtues has led to some serious consequences (remember, the reason there is a war was that Joffery was illegitimate).

Throw into the mix that the realm was being town apart by war and the nobility can be fairly dismissive of the rights of small folk, and I don't think it's reasonable that many in the capital supported the church.
> Granny: Do Targaryens become immune to fire once they "bond" to their dragons?

>George RR Martin: Granny, thanks for asking that. It gives me a chance to clear up a common misconception. TARGARYENS ARE NOT IMMUNE TO FIRE! The birth of Dany's dragons was unique, magical, wonderous, a miracle. She is called The Unburnt because she walked into the flames and lived. But her brother sure as hell wasn't immune to that molten gold.

> Revanshe: So she won't be able to do it again?

> George RR Martin: Probably not.

Targaryens are not immune to fire. 
No they're not. There are Targs who have been killed by fire, such as Summerhall. GRRM has said that what happened with Dany at the end of AGOT was one off and it did involve magic.
Though they do seem to have some tolerance to heat such as Dang having very hot baths. But they're not immune to fire. 
Edit: There's also Jon when he burnt his hand in AGOT saving Old Bear from the wight.
Targs are meant to have high resistance to heat, but are not fire proof

George says that Dany hatching the dragons in the fire was a one off thing.

The showrunners just decided that in their adaptation that dany could be immune to heat and fire in general to make it easier for peeps to understand
Viserys was not the last true dragon--Daenerys is the last true dragon. In the books, her survival was a singular event due to the birth of dragons and other magic at work. In the show, she has been shown to be immune to severe heat from the first episode. And then she has repeatedly been immune to fire and heat throughout the show. She has a superpower in the show that just doesn't exist in the books.


DO YOU WANT TO WAKE THE DRAGON? 
Dany being fireproof is only show thing. Invented by D&D to make her probably opposite to NK who controls Ice, unique and easier to explain.

Book Dany is resistant to heat, well some Targaryens are but not fireproof because they burned pretty well. Summerhall, Viserys with molten gold and even Dany at Daznak's Pit. Whe she hatched dragons, it was one time thing involved magic according to GRRM author.
In the books, Daenerys isn't immune to fire. The hatching of the dragons was a one time event, and she got burned several times after that.

In the show, Daenerys, and only Daenerys is immune to fire. She has been immune since even before dragons hatching and show kept it consistent within show universe as she was always immune. 

In both the show and the books, Targaryens are not immune to fire. Plenty of them died and got badly burnt by fire. 
Well dany gets burnt riding drogan if i remember correctly in the books.Also molten gold over your head would probably work on dany as it has nothing to do with fire.

I've seen a couple of theories on why the WW's don't cross the sea.

1. The Wall isn't that impressive because of it's size. It's so strong because of the magic used in building it. Maybe the magic doesn't end where the wall does and extends much further West/East.
2. The White Walkers or the wights are affraid of the water, can't swim and don't know how to built boats.
3. They can cross the water, but they haven't because they are working on some master plan and don't have to.
4. It's a plot hole. Martin is bad with numbers and didn't create the map until like fiftheen years after he started writing and didn't think about it.

I believe in the first one.
A few thoughts as to why they cannot;

* White Walkers cannot cross the sea because of the Drowned God
* White Walkers cannot past the wall line in anyway, as if they have drawn a line around the world which the Whitewalkers cannot pass.


During Hardhome, the Night King didn't follow Jon after they left in boats. Why is this? Originally I thought because they weren't worth the chase or some form of fear from the Night King because of Jon possibly being [](#s "Azor Ahai"). 

However maybe Whitewalkers fear water because of the Drowned God. We have seen Whitewalkers freeze everything around them as they walk, logically speaking they could put down their foot and freeze the water as they walk somewhat like the Dementors from Harry Potter. 

So far we have seen several different evidence of the gods existing that have been shown on the TV show(Westeros religions only). The Old Gods have been shown to reveal visions of the past like with Bran. R'hllor or the Red God has resurrected various characters. The only two who have not been proven to exist is The Faith of the Seven, who I believe GRRM purposely did this to show an example of how people blindly follow religions, and then the Drowned God who has not been shown at all. Now I'm wondering why this is... Are they waiting until Season 7 or 8 to reveal the power of the drowned god? Will the Drowned God be revealed during this Ironborn plotline that's coming in Season 7? Bran represents the Old Gods, Jon represents the Red God, Arya represents the Many-Faced God, and maybe Theon represents the Drowned God?

Thanks for the thread, it is definitely a question worth asking and it may reveal some of the plans that GRRM has. My theory is that somehow all the gods are going to come together against the Whitewalker threat, that is why "Magic has come alive" since the dragons being reborn, it is like the gods are equipping their people with the tools they need to defeat them. It is possible the Whitewalkers follow an evil satanic-type religion that all the gods want to destroy.

**Edit;** Sorry for the long post! This is my mind-dump on the topic :P
Am i the only one who assumed the headline was setup for a joke? 
Never thought about this, I'm curious as to why they wouldn't do this as well. 

I would say that the wights may not be capable of building ships but they seem to be able to do anything they are willed. 

Maybe the walkers don't know how to make proper ships? Or don't have everything required such as material for sails. Maybe they just don't want to waste the time on it and are confident they will just be able to get through the wall without much trouble.

I like to think that IF the WW's we're going to cross the sea that they could freeze the water itself....now I also see why this would be a problem because obviously the salt in the water makes it unfreezable? 
"At Hardhome, with six ships. Wild seas. Blackbird lost with all hands, two Lyseni ships driven aground on Skane, Talon taking water. Very bad here. Wildlings eating their own dead. Dead things in the woods. Braavosi captains will only take women, children on their ships. Witch women call us slavers. Attempt to take Storm Crow defeated, six crew dead, many wildlings. Eight ravens left. **Dead things in the water.** Send help by land, seas wracked by storms. From Talon, by hand of Maester Harmune."
I came here expecting a why did the chicken cross the road style joke

I am now disappointed
Wights can probably handle basic commands like "Kill them." I doubt that WW's could give them orders to build boats. If there are only 13 or so WW's that can complete complex thoughts, they'd never be able to build enough boats and big enough boats to fit their undead army.
My assumption is that some property of water stops them from crossing it. At the end of Hard home, they all stop and watch as the survivors get away in the row boat, despite the fact that they were only like 20 feet into the water. I assume the Others can manipulate cold, so it would make sense that they could just freeze the water to cross if there wasn't some magic stopping them. But it could also be an intentional decision by the WWE, because they also could've sent the hundreds of wights bolting towards the boat and at least a few of them would make it
would the weather have something to do with it? 
It either snows when the WW come or the WW come when it snows. 
Not sure if Essos is affected by the long winters.
If the dead can be destroyed with fire, then they can also be destroyed by water. A dead body submerged in water for any significant amount of time will bloat and become jelly.
  Why can't the Dothraki? It is just how they were written.
The Wall's full of magic that acts as both a physical and magical barrier to prevent The Others from crossing. The Others are also probably not ready and are binding their time until a more suitable situation to cross South arises.

Another reason is The Others aren't crossing because the plot doesn't allow them to and GRRM/D&D are making this plot up as they go along.
they'll get frostbite
because salt protects one from evil spirits. The ocean is full of salt.

Because they cannot freeze the sea's...yet
I thought this was going to be a joke
Krakens
Why would they?  Do they even know there is more land that way?  Are they interested in taking it over?  I think in order to answer this you have to know their motives which we don't know.  My assumption is that westeros is their homeland and they want to take just that back.  They probably don't know or care about essos.

I wholeheartedly disagree..everything we've seen so far has led to the next two seasons. The stakes have only gotten higher and higher. Sure, a lot of the best characters are gone, but there's no way the next two seasons will come and go without any big shockers, and even if there weren't any big twists and turns, everything has been culminating and setting up for some huge, epic conflicts we're about to see. I don't have the slightest doubt that the next two seasons will be by far the most epic and action packed yet..

How could things possibly get boring from here? It's not like anything has truly been resolved at this point..we are at the beginning of the end. The very start of the climax. And if you think you know how everything will go down, to quote Ramsay, "You haven't been paying attention"
....
All Jon cares about is the welfare of the people of the North and defeating the NK. If becoming the second "King who knelt" achieved those objectives, he'd do it. Would he like vengeance on his father's killers? Yes, but the real mover on that was Geoffrey and he's dead. Sansa can testify that Cersei was not in with Ned's execution. If Cersei can give him what he wants, within reason and trust, he'll make a deal. If Danerys can give him what he wants, he'll make a deal. He's not Robb, he's not in this for vengeance and independence of the North at all costs.
There is no way Jon will side with Cersei, she wants Sansa dead.  Jon isn't going to let that happen.   We know he is treating with Dany and hopefully gain her help, since fighting the WW is kinda important if she wishes to rule any of Westeros.   
Who says the dragons will survive to battle the walkers? Even if they do, the dead far outnumber the living, and dragons may at best make it a fair fight. Jon will not side with the Lannisters, and it is not a simple "Dany will easily take over Kings Landing" situation 
Danny is a foreign conqueror with a known kinslayer and kingslayer as her hand. Even with all the backing she has already the Lords not committed to her already will be staunchly opposed to her.  
  
and who's to say Jon gives title as King in the North? I have a feeling their conversation will go the same way Robb Stark's did with Renly and Stannis,  
  
we want you to abdicate your title of King in the North and swear fealty to me.....  
  
Robb - yea I'm good on that  
  
Jon isn't about to just give up the North to a foreign conqueror, I think there will be considerable peaceful conflict with him and Danny because even with her force she needs the North to take Kings Landing

But how would people find out that she can't bear children unless she publicly says so? If she wins the war (and doesn't destroy the whole city on the way) and survives, she WILL sit on the throne. Her leaving an heir is something that might come up afterwards, but it won't affect whether she gets to sit on the chair or not.
GRRM pulls a lot from history (especially English history), so this could parallel Elizabeth I, who died childless. Her cousin was Mary Queen of Scots (maybe Jon Snow) whose son ended up being King James IV of Scotland (The North) and James I of England and Ireland (Westeros). This would allow Jon to still be an independent King in the North as, within a generation, the North and Westeros would be reunited through inheritance.
The parts of the ambiguous prophecy will happen and she will have a child (and probably die in childbirth).  She is supposed to see Drogo again after all.
Well a dwarf's cock is said to have a magical properties as per GOT so we can all look towards Tyrion :P
I recently realised that she said it in s6 when meeting the khal 
"And I will bear no children, for you, or anyone else. Not until the sun rises in the west and sets in the east" 
Never payed any attention to it I just thought it was some bad ass talk, but when I read the books I remembered that dany had some child birth issues.
This is also the reason why I don't think she will marry Jon, it would end the targaryan line
As long as she's strong enough for the lords of Westeros to recognize her decrees, Dany can name an heir.

And the show has subtly referenced her infertility a couple times.
Or plot twist. Dany always think she never can able to bear a living child again and then suddenly she gets herself pregnant.
Don't really like this idea. But I'm trying to find another alternative because not really can buying something so straightforward in asoiaf world.

The thing is, prophecies come true in the series. The witch told Dany "When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before" 

Sun rises in the west and sets in the east - potentially Dorne marching on King's Landing
The seas go dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves - This could have something to do with the Greyjoys with the sea, but also the Mountain falling could be the "mountains" mentioned in the prophecy

There's definitely a possibility of her having a child, according to the prophecy.
I picture her not telling anybody.  She can still make a powerful marriage alliance, the other family wouldn't have to know she was sterile til afterwards, if they knew at all.
A lot of people have Targaryen ancestry including Gendry from his great-grandmother and all the Sand Snakes.
Tyrion will never be king, unless he usurps the throne.  He has no claim.  Robert won the throne, so the Lannisters have no claim to it inherently - only a marriage tie.   Cersei taking the throne isn't based on any inheritance, she basically usurped it herself.  Normally if Tommen died there would be a great council but she just blew up most of those who would take part in it.  Not to mention the fact that he is a disfigured dwarf convicted of one treason while committing another who has already been blamed for shitty rule before, as the "twisted demon monkey" during his stint as Joffrey's hand.  The smallfolk already hate him.
Dany has to die, Cersei has to die, Jaime has to die or re-enter the Kingsguard, Jon Snow may have to die, and everyone has to accept the Imp as their ruler, which they'd never do. 
I imagine a step-stool of some sort would have to be installed, and maybe a pillow on the back of it so he doesnt slide so far back that he cant get out
Tyrion ends up as the guy actually running Westros but doesn't actually become king.
I could see it happening. Dany takes the throne and Cersei is killed. Then Dany names Tyrion her heir because he seems to be closer to her than her other advisers. Then she goes north to fight the White Walkers and dies, leaving him to step up as King.
I don't think tyrion would ever have a direct claim, even if Cersei was dead, but if Dany manages to usurp the throne then she could name him protector of the realm. 
  Tyrion and Dany marry and he becomes king.

He'd have to be on the winning side in the big battle, probably riding a dragon.  Dany would have to die, likely need to be killed by Tyrion.  Maybe she kills Jon.  Most of the current nobility would need to be dead, Greyjoys dead or contained, Lannisters dead, Tyrells dead, Sand Snakes dead or contained, the North independent or bending the knee.  The people would probably be fine, with winter coming they don't care who sits on the throne.  If he defeats the walkers, so much the better.
In the end, I don't believe anyone will give a shit about the Iron Throne. There will be aq new world order.
I actually think by the end of this show, littlefinger wins and sits on the iron throne and everything sort of resets. The song of ice and fire will be something they sing during littlefinger's reign.
I believe grrm has only killed off 1 main character in his books so far and by main i mean people with pov chapters.
Tyrion has a lot of enemies in King's Landing... i.e. the whole city.  Now, if Dany can essentially remove that threat... he still wouldnt have a chance because Dany sees the throne as her own.  I dont see a way Tyrion could take it without seriously betraying Dany.
Grrm Would Have To Drink A Couple Bottles Of Imps Delight And Finish Writing 
there really is no possibly of Tyrion sitting on the Iron Throne, he has no claim and no army that would allow him to usurp it. Even if they go with the theory that Tyrion is actually the Mad King's son..................yes this is a theory among book readers because Aerys was in love with Tyrion's mother and Tyrion has an affinity and unnatural curiousity for dragons in the books.  
  
Anyway even if they played that angle, he still committed regicide in everybody's eyes, and he kinslayed. those 2 things alone would disqualify him from ever taking the throne.  
  
plus Cersei has effectively pissed off every major Lord in the 7 kingdoms so they are all about to rebel against the Iron Throne ala season 2
I think trying to extrapolate possible acceptance of Cersei or Dany as being predictive of acceptance of Tyrion is way off.

Dany has managed to create a certain amount of mystique about herself. She's also a Targ who has dragons. More mystique. And she's good at a very difficult thing, which is making use of the desire of capable men without ever actually having to have sex with any of them, which would be disaster since the other capable men who desire her would bail if that happened. 

Cersei, if the show is at all realistic, will be - though she won't realize it - entirely dependent upon Jaime's support. He controls their forces, and now he's not even Kingsguard. He is straight up Lord of Casterly Rock, Warden of the West, Shield of Lannisport, etc, the very second he decides to accept that fact. The slightest whisper of opposition from him takes the armies away from her entirely. He controls those armies, unless the show goes out of its way to build Bronn into the actual general there. I suppose they could do that, and that Cersei could cultivate Bronn, if she recognizes she needs to.

But anyway.

Point being, none of this is available to Tyrion. Westeros *could* someday accept a disabled man as their king. If he was hereditary, sure. If the man's family had demanded respect for him his entire life. But everyone knows that Tyrion's father despised him and in fact personally assured that Tyrion's gifts were never acknowledged and that he was never viewed as valuable in any way.

So, Tyrion...he's very like Miles Vorkosigan. Future generations of people with disabilities will benefit from his visibility and importance and acceptance by the rulers he serves, but Tyrion himself is the laborer in service of that future. If Dany rules, he provides evidence that the intellect of the disabled is to be respected. If Jaime rules, he provides evidence that the disabled are worthy of love from their families. But he himself cannot rule because there was never a Tyrion before him to labor and provide the needed example.
It isn't that far fetched. All you people worried about everyone other than Danny and cersei abdicating or needing to die overlook the central rule of westeros. 

Power resides where men believe it resides. 

If Dany were to die in battle, Tyrion would probably take the lead of her big fucking army, and as long as he kept the Iron Born and the Dragons from turning on him (the dragons really) he would be OK. The Martels really only care about dorne and the Tyrells are wiped out (on the show). 

Fun exercise but it isn't going to happen. 
R + L = J is probably the biggest one. But that's more because the show just surpassed the books as far as timeline goes. 
That Sandor was still alive is another confirmed theory. 

R + L= J being the main one. Aegon "Targaryen" being a fake is essentially confirmed since they left him out of the plot. 
oh man, i realized just now i will never be able to answer this because i watched the show first. :(

10 Game of Thrones filming locations you can visit.

Have you ever thought of taking a trip to where your favorite blockbuster movie, TV Drama or series was filmed? For most people, this looks like a far-fetched idea, but that is not the case when it comes to Game of Thrones. The Game of Thrones is by far one of the most enthralling American fantasies Drama well known for its gory death scenes. Game of Thrones is based on the book by George R.R Martin. It is well known for its bloodbaths, violent and some of the best scenes. However, one thing that will strike you out is the real-life setting of the lands of fire, ice much more. They are a lot more tranquil, and peaceful making lovers of the drama want to visit there. Below you will find 10  Game of Thrones filming locations.

The modern Lannisters are descended from a Lannister woman whose husband took her name. The Mormont and Stokeworth names are currently going through women. The Stark name is fine.
Well, they pronouncing him Kingindanorf, so I'd guess he could legitimize himself.
If we use European noble houses as a model of how Westeros works, there's a tradition of noble houses preserving their "line" by either adopting male heirs (which might easily happen with Jon here -- as basically happened when Elizabeth I was succeeded by James I) or by a female heir keeping her maiden name when she marries, and perhaps her husband taking her name (as could happen with Sansa -- as happened with the current British royal family).  
Last name can continue from the maternal line; Jon could also be legitimized as a Stark and continue the name.  There's really no cause for concern, since there's three available candidates that can produce heirs

Most people can still get an erection if they're paralyzed from waist down, different nerves and such, you just might not be able to feel anything. Idk about everything else.
Bran can still get it up. It's a different system all together. 

Also, I think there's a legitimate argument for legitimizing himself as Jon Stark. He might have Targaryen blood, and is likely a legitimate Targaryen at that, but he was raised a Stark, behaves as a Stark, and thinks like a Stark. If he had to choose a surname for himself I bet it'd be Stark rather than Targaryen.
on a somewhat related note, how weird would Jon Stark sound at this point? Just doesn't have the same ring as Snow!
Jon and Sansa? Boom, Stark/Targ ultra race

If Robin Arryn dies his cousin Harry Hardyngg will take the name Arryn.  I think they can do whatever they want.  

A Lannister lady once gave her name to her husband and the whole thing with Bael the Bard stealing the Stark girl is another example of how they get around succession issues.
One of the things I wish the show had spent more time on is the Iron Islands. I found the Kingsmoot and all the extended Greyjoy family to be much more compelling in the books. 

One of the things that I really liked that the show changed was to have Arya be Tywin's cupbearer. The scenes between them were always really good and the tension from the possibility of him learning her true identity made for some really good tv. 
Positive: The show comes out on schedule. 
I think having Theon burn and display "Bran and Rickon" at Dagmer's behest rather than Ramsay's made far more sense for his arc in Season 2 and avoided the somewhat weird offscreen Reek plotline from the books to boot. While this came at the cost of certain aspects of the Ramsay/Theon dynamic, I think overall the tradeoff was worth it.

Also liked the emphasis they put on humanising Hizdahr from his very first scene, brought back some of the moral complexity that had been lacking in Dany's storyline since the first season ended. I liked her antagonists in the other seasons, but given that Meereen was the focus of her plotline for a long time, it made sense to introduce a more sympathetic character to represent the city.
- Margaery, Jorah and Bronn are a lot better in the show

- Hardhome

Negatives:

- Dorne was much weaker in the show (and I didn't like it in the books either).
It's a small change, but I liked that the show changed the Eyrie's Moon Door to a gaping hole in the floor, rather than a normal door like it was described in the books.
least favorite change: the wolves have a much less screentime than they have in the books
I feel like this isn't mentioned enough, but one of my favorite parts in the series is how Brienne actually runs into Arya. The whole Hound surviving the inn brawl and doing a few more things afterwards I thought was a fantastic change, and i really like that there's someone of worth in the world that is aware of Arya's survival
Things I don't like:

No Dorne

Butchered Iron Islands storyline (No cleftjaw, victarion and minimal damphair)


Things I like:

Bronn was good in the books, but I think Jerome Flynn made show Bronn exponentially better in the shows.

I like how Smalljon died trying to save Robb, but show Smalljon (Although a cunt) is a swag demon and played so well!
Things I like:

Cersei being more sympathetic and three-dimensional as a character

Speeding up Tyrion's journey to Daenerys

Charles Dance as Tywin Lannister and fleshing out his relationship with his children 

Increasing Margaery and Olenna's prominence

Show!Jorah, Show!Oberyn and Show!Bronn are much better than their book counterparts

Aging up the characters from the books 

Some amazing episodes (Blackwater, Kissed By Fire, The Rains of Castamere, The Lion and the Rose, The Mountain and the Viper, The Children, Hardhome, Home, Book of the Strangers, The Door, Battle of the Bastards, The Winds of Winter...)

Many show-only scenes have been really good, like Robert/Cersei, Catelyn/Talisa, Tyrion/Cersei, Tyrion/Jaime and Tywin/Cersei


Things I dislike:

Most of the Dorne storyline

Jon/Daenerys' storylines in Season 2

Lack of activity for Tyrion in Season 6

Catelyn being sidelined after Season 1

How Arya's Braavos arc ended


I was a teeny bit disappointed that Ned Stark wasn't as snarky as he was in the books. One of my favourite scenes in the books was when Ned sassed Pycelle when he was injured, and that was great. However, Sean Bean did a very good job in portraying Ned Stark imo.

I also agree that Arya being Tywin's cupbearer was really interesting. 
Still waiting on this Victarion guy to show up.
Apparently in the books, Jon Connington is still alive (but contracted greyscale the same way that Jorah contracted it; their characters were morphed this way), and that he's been secretly raising the Mad King's son Aegon as his own. The Mountain had apparently killed baby Aegon so barbarically that the body was unrecognizable, meaning that it's fully possible that Aegon actually escaped into hiding as a baby the same way Daenarys and Viserys did. And it's been rumored that casting calls have gone out for an actor with Connington's characteristics.
Changes I like: I like that Robb was given much more screen time than on the books. And while I think the reason Robb married Talisa in the show is worse than the reason he married Jeyne in the books, I do like that we actually get to know Talisa a bit while we don't see a whole lot of Jeyne. I also like that Jon went to Hardhome in the show. The cinematography was incredible and the logic behind him going was sound. 

Things I didn't like: I can't stand how dirty the show has done Euron. The bridge scene was okay, but the Kingsmoot was nothing compared to its book counterpart. The book's moot portrayed Euron as this terrifying, charismatic, and above all larger-than-life character who has a dragon binding horn and the means to achieve his ambitions. The show's moot had Euron acting like that weird uncle who has been through three divorces and talks about his big dick at a family reunion while also appearing as someone who wants the Iron Throne but doesn't show any potential means of gaining it than a big cock and a marriage offer. book!Euron is mystical, he's a guy you either hate to love, love to love, or love to fear, but you can't help that he's one of the most enthralling characters George has thrown into the mix. show!Euron just kills and laughs about it and makes the Ironborn look like a bunch of idiots. 

I also don't like that the Pink Letter came after Jon's resurrection in the show and not before. Jon rallying wildlings and others (other groups of men, not Others) to take Winterfell back from the Boltons was so much more powerful when he did so knowing that he was breaking one of the last few concrete vows he had upheld through his time with the Watch. That chapter is one of my absolute favorites in the books and, while the show executed it well, I just wish the buildup to his death had been more intense as it was in the books.
My least favourite change is the Jaime arc, he is one of my favourites in the books, but his arc in the show is kinda weak. I also don't like the Sansa arc, she was set-up to become a player in season 4, but that was completely destroyed in season 5. 

Things I like: 
Tyrion getting to Dany earlier and not meeting Penny, I think the Dany/Tyrion dynamic works really well, plus it leads to some interesting potentials for when they meet Jaime (him being Tyrion's brother, but also Dany's fatherslayer). 

I also really liked that they made Robb a more prominent character in the show, although his marriage plot is weaker. 
I loved Strong Belwas in the books - shame he wasn't in the show.
Dorne is the easy answer for the least favorite changes. Arianne is such a great character it would have been awesome to have seen her introduced to the show. 

I'm actually pretty ok with the show not introducing the Young Grif/Aegon storyline.

I do like that Arya killed Walder Frey, that saved what was an overall disappointing Faceless Man Storyline. Actually, I really like all of the other changes to Arya's storyline. Her time with Tywin, the Brotherhood, and The Hound were great on tv.




I know I'm really late to this but I'm really sad about how the Thenns are portrayed in the show. In the books they are some of the most interesting and dangerous wildlings but are nothing more than two dimensional villains in the show. Also I really like Alys Karstark, too bad she's not in the show
One of my favorite book characters is Wyman Manderly. I feel like they gave all of his good lines to Lyanna Mormont.

Also the book has a character named Dickon Manwoody. He doesn't do anything and has no impact whatsoever, but they really missed the boat by taking him out. When Dickon Manwoody isn't on screen, all the other characters should be saying "Where's Dickon Manwoody?"

When Tyrion is held prisoner in The Vale of Arryn the trial by combat is held in a garden on top of the castle, in the show its in a dingy castle interior.
Favorite change the show made was changing the timing of Oberyn's speech to Tyrion to right before he says he will be his champion instead of immediately after they meet. 


either a brother from a really long time ago or benjens but hes probably dead so idk

A lot of people assume it was benjins. 
'arry potta's invisibility cloak govna
Sam, Green, and Edd find the horn with the rest of it in the show.


I believe we even have a scene later in the show that shows that Sam still has the horn.


EDIT:

[Here is a screen grab.](http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bag-Dragonglass-horn.png)
i was wondering this too because at the end of season 6 do we not see benjen with his black cloak on?
I thought the idea was that the first men buried sone supplies like a weapons cache
Sam finds the horn on the show as well 
https://youtu.be/QqSdHokQZ8g
cold hands i think

In the show, the horn is with the "dragonglass" knives and spearheads. Who buried them there hasn't been explained, but it certainly wasn't Benjin.
Some things are best left mysteries, makes the world feel more believable. IMO it's bad writing for every single thing ever to have its own backstory and origin. Sometimes IRL you just don't know where something came from or how it got where it is.

I think at the end of the day she was actually and naturally a sweet person. I mean yeah she upped the ante on the whole "innocent princess" act but I don't think her real personality was a complete 180.

I mean even in the books most of the Tyrells are known to be extremely nice people, especially her two older brothers Willas and Garlan. 
The scenes with her grandmother in the gardens were ones where she was always 'herself'
There was the moment in the sept of Baelor when she realised something was wrong. The look on her face was really great. Very convincing. Natalie Dormer is a great actress and I couldn't think of a better Margaery. 
I think the lunch where Sansa meets Olenna and they are asking about Joff's true nature. The two moments I can think of specifically are when she berates her grandmother a little bit sensing how terrified Sansa is, and when Sansa finally tells truth and she's all "pity, but I'm not surprised".
This isn't necessarily breaking character, but it's showing her true nature---when Littlefinger asks what she wants and she tells him that she wants to be queen. Her king doesn't matter. She just wants to rule.
When she was talking to Olenna about jewellery that would please Joffrey and remarked 'a row of sparrows heads ' or something like that. I could imagine her at Olenna's age being just as sharp and irreverent as her grandmother. 
There's a moment before she head to the orphanage she steps out her litter stony-faced and then puts on this false smile as she begins to walk through the shit-covered streets.

Margery was well-portrayed on screen; you could see in the scenes she shared with her sibling and other family that she is exactly who she seems to be, just smarter than she lets on. She wasn't a snake, she wasn't evil, and she had no inclination to burn innocent people. She was just a smart girl trying to survive in a chaotic political climate with nothing but her charm (wits) and family loyalty to guide her. 

She's incredibly smart and observant and she is 100% her true self in every scene. She's a good person who only tried to hide her intelligence to protect herself and her family.
> Loras! Highgarden!

Cringeworthy for me
Interestingly Arya was sent to assasinate an actress from a theatre group while her first intended victim was a duplicitous con-man. Was this a nod to this theory?

The other takeaway from this post is that Stephen Fry has now joined Morgan Freeman in the list of people I want reading me to sleep.

"All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players; They have their exits and their entrances, And one man in his time plays many parts"

-William Shakespeare 
I'm not sure if it's related, but the title of "The Faceless Men" reminds me of the title of the Joseph Campbell book "Hero With A Thousand Faces."
the person you act like at the bank and the person you act like at Taco Bell at 2:00 am are probably...or should be...totally different people. It is known. 
It's Blackadder 
He originally auditioned for the part of Jon Snow, which ended up going to Kit Harington. Looking back at it, I can't possibly imagine Alfie as Jon. Although he is better at doing the accent than Kit is.
Almost forgot what sub I was in
Though he doesn't look one bit like book theon, he's been absolutely phenomenal in capturing the essence of Reek.
Brilliant acting, just as Iwan Rheon portraying ramsay. Sometimes I wonder how the show would be if they've swapped those roles.
I don't think I've ever had a show have a character make me hate them so much and then feel so sorry for them so quickly. 

He was phenomenal. 

He carried that same douchey vibe into John Wick 100%, too. 
NOT ALFIE , REEK!
He always evokes the reaction from the viewer that his character intends. Fantastic actor. 
Wow, never seen this thread before

Alfie has done a tremendous job.

Alfie allen Peter dink lage and Charles dance are the three best actors in the series
Remains to be seen how the books address this fully. Some folks are speculating the prologue will be a first person account of Hardhome which would be cool. Either way, the show absolutely killed it. Might be my favorite 15 minutes of television.
''...and now my war begins.'' :) 

And GRRM said: Nope. You have to die first. lol
While I absolutely love the TV adaptation of Hardhome (easily some of the best minutes of television) I definitely wouldn't disparage the books. I think the passage here really captures a horrible sense of forboding and rising terror/hopelessness... The 'dead things in the water' lines are terrifying, and the whole letter is very reminiscent of the 'we cannot get out' book passage in lord of the rings.
Hardhome is the best change the show made to the books. Hands down
Show left out the cool lore behind Hardhome though, it's pretty creepy in the books

Hardhome was awesome. Best stuff the show has come up with.
I loved how the books left it to our imagination. But by that stage as a reader you're already a little sceptical of what second hand accounts can mean in this world. That's why I loved how the show actually showed what happened by taking Jon there. 

Probably still one of my most tense moments watching. 
"Snowflakes swirled from a dark sky and ashes rose to meet them, the grey and the white whirling around each other as flaming arrows arced above a wooden wall and dead things shambled silent through the cold, beneath a great grey cliff where fires burned inside a hundred caves. Then the wind rose and the white mist came sweeping in, impossibly cold, and one by one the fires went out. Afterward only the skulls remained. "
Hardhome almost made up for the show skipping the Battle of the Fist of the First Men. Almost. 
I remember reading that passage from the book late at night. It was absolutely chilling. I thought Hardhome in the show was great but I do really hope we get a first hand account of what went down there in the next book. 
I read the books, and was blown away by the show's adaptation.  They made it a spectacular showcase for the whitewalkers' power, and I think it was a genius move.
Wait so in the books Jon didnt go to hardhome ? Or he went as back up ?
I think it did a great job showing the white walkers best weapon... Fear. Think about it the wildlings outside its walls (must be a at least 10,000) just shit themselves and banged on the wall until they were all dead. If they had turned and charged or even just tried to defend themselves at the edge of the wall instead of just panicking they might have at least bought time for a larger evacuation. 
One of the few times the adaptations is better than the book (source material)
The scene is definitely one of the best in the show
My friend is a book reader and I remember him texting me going out of his fucking mind during this episode. It was weird because normally it was me losing my mind to him about shit he already knew about but this episode was special. We were both losing our shit so hard.
I've complained a lot about some of the differences between the show and the books, I know a lot of it is petty, but this is by far the best change they've made. Hardhome was my favorite episode of the show so far. The Wildling woman who is introduced was instantly one of my favorite characters, it's insane how quickly they were able to get fans attached to her. 
Are the books worth the read? I started out with the show. During season 4 I turned on HBO one night and watched "The Lion and The Rose" and was immediately fascinated and had to start over and binge watch from the beginning. Now that season 7 is approaching and I've bee caught up since season 4 I'm afraid reading the books won't be worth my time because I already know most of the storyline. I know the books and show are somewhat different. Just want to know whether or not I should purchase the books and read them or if I will be disappointed in doing so. WINTER IS UPON US!
Hardhome was great, one of the only good changes from the books. 
one of the only changes in the show I actually agree with. Some of the others have been quite questionable. 

Still, I wish they would have put more time into Jons story at the wall itself, and the complications of allowing the Wildlings past the wall. 
Books: Developing characters. Building suspense. Beautiful writing.
Show: FANTASY ACTION.
I'd like to see the issues take nup in the prologue as well.  The battle made me like the North drama again. I sued to just think this was dragging on and on and on. Finally we get to see some Walking Dead on Speed in Game of Thrones.  
"and now my war begins" FUCK
Book did it better

Welp.

And then season 6 happened lol
I'm a book fan, but I'm thakful the show made hardhome slightly better then a desperate note. 
The show is so far above the tedium of books 4 and 5.  Hopefully George rights the ship in book 6.

This is the one thing I really hate about the books.

 Show, don't tell.

Edit: Oh shit an opinion!
Tldr?
Ned was named Regent, not King. Robert wanted Ned to rule and guide Joffrey (who would still be King, but wouldn't have full powers) until Joffrey came of age, after which he would become the King and Ned would presumably step down.

Ned knew Joffrey was illegitimate, but he didn't want to lay that shit on his dying best friend, so he kept quiet about it. What he did instead was change Robert's will from saying "Ned should be regent until **my son Joffrey** comes of age" to "my rightful heir", which in this case means Stannis.

Stannis is already of age, so Ned wouldn't actually be regent by the amended will. Stannis would be King immediately.
He named him Lord Protector, which is a basically a regent to rule in his heirs place until he comes of age. And no he never wanted to be king. 
Its clearer in the book. Ned realizes that Joffrey and Tommen are illegitimate, but decides not to burden Robert with that fact in his final moments. The book describes how he transcribes "until my son Joffrey comes of age" as "until my heir comes of age" in the letter he then signs and seals on his deathbed (and Cersei later rips up while laughing about it). I believe these details are all in the show as well, but not as clearly spelled out.
Ned was telling everyone with the letter he was hanging Cersei, written by Robert: "I hereby name Lord Eddard Stark Lord Protector of the Realm etc..."

He didn't want to be King - no ... but he has Barristan Selmy read a letter sealed with Robert's seal in front of the court naming him Lord Protector until Joffery comes of age...which of course led to Janos Slynt and Petyr betraying him at the very same court.

Welcome!
Congrats mods. I wish you Good fortune in the Wars to come. And now it begins.
Winter is Coming and so are new reinforcements for this wonderful subreddit. Welcome.
Congratz to all the new mods, hope to have the honour of mod next time :D 
Wow I was unaware of this and didn't apply.  But I am beyond disappointed I wasn't chosen!
WOWOWOWOWOWOW
In the books,  there is a secret entrance that only a brother of the nights watch can open.  It's how Sam lets Bran and company through.    Presumably he gets in through some similar method. 
Maybe he just went back to Castle Black and then deserted at a later date?

I mean, the tv series has always been pretty vague/varied on the lengths of time passing between each scene.
While that is true, is it not plausible that a ranger of the nights watch who routinely patrols the castles on the walls would know a way over to the other side of the wall without climbing over it? Its not as big of a plothole as youre making it out to be

Why couldn't he have gone through a gate? Someone must have known he was alive to know he'd deserted the Night's Watch and not just been murdered with the other rangers. He might have gone through Castle Black and then deserted. That's how they knew to chase him down. Don't forget that time Jon almost deserted. It was only because his friends knew he was planning on running away that he didn't make it very far.
I dont know the exact number of castles on the wall (aprox. 20?), but only 3 are manned, so he could have easily slipped through an unmanned castle
I've wondered the same thing. Is it possible there was a good amount of time that had passed, and the guy had time to make it to the coast, by Eastwatch by the sea, and sneak around that way?
The wildlings do, and they raid south of the wall. Thus the northerners hold the watch in a higher regard. However, rangers do patrols on these castles, they just arent garrisoned like Castle Black, the Shadow Tower or Eastwatch-by-the-Sea
On the west end of the Wall, there's a bridge over a gorge. Too much of a bottleneck for an army, but an individual can sneak through easily.
well there are multiple ways across the wall; some easier than others. he could have sailed across the edge climbed the top or passed through a secret gate. it's been said that the wall can stop an army, but not a single man.
He could have just came back to castle black then ran away in the night.

There is alot of castles along the wall that are unmanned,but there gates should be sealed.There is also hidden entrances,such as the one sam uses.Or he could of swam around east watch/used a raft.Or he could of climbed it like the wildlings.


Not everyone goes through the wall. There's past th water on the east and west, over ice. 
Having known nothing about the show/books when I watched the first episode, I was very confused at this scene.  I actually thought he was still on the North side and was wandering around lost (in a bad place mentally from what he just saw).  I had also wondered why he hadn't tried to say he got lost fleeing from the WW, and wasn't actually deserting.
There are numerous open and unchecked gates.

edit: people who downvoted me clearly didn't read the books or pay attention to the show where it was mentioned numerous times about unguarded towers.
King Borislav of the House Tereshchenko, first of his name, King of the Slavs, Lord of Ukraine, Protector of the Realm, rightful Lord of Crimea, Squattingborn, the Unsober, father of Adidas and breaker of car doors.

On a more serious note, that looks dope!

That's the most Slavic thing I've seen all week

Tywin. Uncompromising and emotionless son of a bitch with no sense of decency, but he's sure as shit an interesting and enjoyable character to watch, especially when he's verbally sparring with Tyrion, putting Joffrey in his place or quizzing Arya.
Littlefinger.


He's a scheming bastard, but damn if his schemes aren't interesting.
Shae. 

I hated her in the end for what she became, but I really wanted to believe she was the hooker with a heart of gold. On rewatch I still realy like her, especially in her scenes with Bronn. 
Cersei, she is awful. She killed Margaery and Loras, two characters I really liked. And she was visibly pleased when Oberyn had his head squished like a grape. She actively seeks to have Tyrion (my 2nd favorite character) killed. There is no reason why I should like her, but I do. I enjoy her awfulness. 





Jon. 

I love his character but hate the story demands that his mistakes be rewarded. I hate that he chose to stay loyal to the Night's Watch. I hate that he actually tried to go in and assassinate Mance. I hate that he turned down Stannis' offer to become Lord of Winterfell. I hate that he led his army to its death during the Battle of the Bastards. You know what happens? Ygritte spares him, Stannis comes out of nowhere to rescue and he's elected Lord Commander, Sansa rescues him and then he's named King in the North. I dislike that he's rewarded for his mistakes when all of the other characters suffer greatly for theirs (besides Daenerys).
Victarion. He doesn't have the smarts and is a bit of a brute but he's about as badass as they come.
With so many to choose from, it's tough.  There's Littlefinger, the Kingslayer, Cersei, Robb.  But the winner of this competition has to be Tywin Lannister, Savior of the Realm and Hand of the King.  

Almost everything he does is awesome in some way, the way he presents himself, the way he delivers, etc.  However, he is a pretty despicable human being.  He's ruthless, has little regard for life, and is vengeful.  And let's not forget about how he treated Tyrion.  Everything he did was despicable but he did them in such amazing ways.  You felt his power.
Ramsay.
Right now it's Arya. I'm afraid of the person she is now, how will she behave? The last scene of hers left  me with doubt.
Cersie, she's a horrible person, but she killed off those religious fanatics and to me that makes up for almost everything 
Jamie. He recently has shown us that he is heartless when he rapes Cersei and threatens to kill off the Tully line. And nobody liked early few seasons Jamie, especially since he tries to kill Bran in one of the first few episodes and just is a general asshole. Still, he sacrificed his honor for the lives of many in King's Landing. His redemption arc is interesting and endearing, but he is so nasty at his core. I think he knows it, but he is a nasty person.
Joffrey and Ramsey, I loved to hate them.

Cersei. I hate her for killing Margaery but love her cause she's a snarky badass. 
For sure Ned. He was just too honorable :( 
Robert Baratheon. Guy was an abusive alcoholic who spent his whole life bitter over an idealized image of a girl who didn't even love him back, didn't give a flying fuck about any of his "children" with Cersei OR his many bastards, supported the murder of innocent children and sat back and drank, got his dick sucked by whores and stuffed his face while other people ran his kingdom for him, only managing to plunge the crown into a vast ocean of debt. Yet I love him, and ironically he's the best King to sit the Iron throne the series has had yet (Which really says something about Cersei, Joffrey and Tommen)
Joffrey, the kid was a lying sociopath. But, he had some hilarious lines.

Robb, the King of The North was really a good guy and was a great leader. He was just an idiot when it came to crossing the Frey's and killing Karstark. Those two decisions ended up costing him everything.


loving and hating Sansa about 50/50. I hated her. then I loved her. Now I'm confused.

Cersei. I love how she isn't afraid to do what needs to be done to protect herself and her kids, and she looks badass doing it. But goddamn she is a bitch.
Cersei 100%. It's easy to hate her but her cunningness and unwillingness to be a typical woman is hard not to like..............plus she's badass
Hmmm, theres been quite a few (notably the neutering of Jaime's character as a whole), but I'd probably say Tyrion killing Tywin over Shae, as opposed to Tysha. There was a serious point of satisfaction with Tyrion getting revenge for Tysha, especially after the reveal that she wasn't even a whore. Its probably Tywin's most horrendously cruel thing he's done and him being reminded of it before Tyrion finally kills him is just soooo satisfying, and no 2 actors could better convey the complex emotions needed for that scene than Peter Dinklage and Charles Dance. In the show, he was pissed about being arrested and Tywin banging Shae so he killed him. Not much of a punch there, imo 
Killing off Barristan Selmy so early and the way that David and Dan did. Like okay, it's supposed to indicate that even a venerated knight doesn't get to die in a glorious battle (no one is safe), but I felt there were better ways to do that than the approach that they had.

Even Ian McElhinney wasn't a fan of it.
It's not a big one but it still gets on my nerve sometimes - Joffrey ordering for Robert Baratheon's bastards in Kings Landing to be killed on the show, while it was Cersei in the books. I don't see any reason for Joffrey to take out this order when he's said so many times that it is not a 'claim' to the throne he has, it is *his* no matter what. So why should he feel threatened by some harmless bastards? It just didn't make sense to me.
No Doran Martell "Fire and Blood" speech.
Strong Belwas 
Butchering Dorne root and stem 
This is really minor, but I wish they hadn't given random Ironborn #3 Dagmer Cleftjaw's name. He's so forgettable in the show that most of my friends don't know who I'm talking about—definitely not true for Cleftjaw in the books. 
No Lady Stoneheart and badass Doran & Arianne Martell
Until now , there isn't an Aegon VI in the show last time I checked  (it was a while ago but I don't think it changed ) . Like really ? You skipped Jon Connington and motherfucking Aegon VI and his 10 000 elite mercenaries ? WHY ?
 I would of liked to have seen the northern lords in winterfell while stannis was sat on his lake of ice waiting for them.Rather then him foolishly order an assault on winterfell after most his army abandons him
The secondary storylines are somewhat slaughtered. All of them.

Dorne

Iron Islands 

Sam/The citadel


The lack of Victarion & Moqorro, as well as a proper Siege of Meereen. Now, I don't care about Penny, but I still would've liked to see Tyrion's Cyvasse shenanigans with a certain Sellsword. As for Victarion, he's not a good guy, he likely will never be a good guy, but I still couldn't help but to like him and symphatize with him to a lesser degree, plus he's a badass. Needless to say I'm disappointed that we didn't get to see him in the show.

I guess I'm somewhat disappointed about the lack of Griff & Young Griff, though I understand why they were excluded from the show. I'm perfectly fine with Lady Stoneheart getting cut(no pun intended), though.
I'm *nearylllyy* finished with the books...about 150 pages to go. And, I have to say...the Stannis storyline.

I know we all love the mannis and it's something I kept hearing the whole time, but now that I've read it more myself, I can see why people were annoyed.

**Best change that TV did do...**

Tyrion not riding a pig. Yeah. Oh and Hardhome plus Tywin / Arya scenes.
Dorne, the very minimal attention payed to the Ironborn and the goings on on the Iron Islands, a ton of characters and storylines I could mention that were left out (not that I blame them, tv shows have limitations that words on a page do not), excluding the Northern Mountain Clans and Stannis' escapades in the North, completely changing the Smalljon's character, changing the nature of the exchange between Tyrion and Jaime during Tyrion's escape, killing Barristan (especially in the way in which it happened).
Euron - the most badass character in the books imo 
and Stannis - a military genius that would never burn his daughter to have better odds in a battle
People love to nag about Dorne but in the books Dorne was just as fucking boring. 

Honestly as someone who's read the books Dorne literally was chapter after chapter of people arguing, one lame ass fight scene(I AM THE NIGHT!!11111) and more arguing followed by a half page of a cool speech. 


For me it's not one plot point or omission, it's just a gradual and total shift in writing quality. The show lost so much of the intrigue I originally loved and most of what they write exclusively for it is very poor quality compared to the early seasons.

Oh well. I'll enjoy every episode as it draws to a close, which is all that matters. Worst change for me was Stannis. I can't pinpoint precisely why, but I liked book Stannis much more. In the show he's so much more a puppet of the red woman and his fate was pretty unspectacular.
In the books, Oberyn announces that he is Tyrions champion, during trial,.... right in front of Tywin's face. It would have been nice to witness this mic drop moment.
I get why they did it, but I actually liked in the book how Theon just kind of disappeared for a while.  In contrast, I personally think the show overdid it a bit with scenes showing his captivity (what with the "we are escaping", "actually it was a trick").  But that's just me.
so in the show, dany holds missandei's hand and closes her eyes and waits for death. drogon then comes and saves her by burning her enemies yada yada...
in the books, drogon comes and starts killing enemies, spectators, basically just anyone who moves, dany jumps down, with a whip in her hand, and tames the dragon... 
haven't read the scene in awhile but i am pretty sure that is how it goes... 
we waited for years and years and years to see dany ride a dragon and when we did, for me, it was glorious... because she earned the dragon... then the show completely screwed it up... 
Tyrion and Jamie's last scene together before Tyrion left for Westeros.  There was so much the show left out that really ruined Tyrion's road to recovery
Dorne. Dorne. Also Dorne. Did I mention Dorne?
Euron, just Euron. The show completely changed his character and rise to power. They took away all his subtlety and charm; no idea why the ironborn chose him over Yara since all he did was admit to kinslaying and gave vague promises.
No legitimate naval combat, especially that surrounding Victarion. It could have been really cool.
I guess this will not go well with many show watchers, but: 

**Bringing back Sandor Clegane / The Hound was a bad decision.**

I think the "gravedigger theory" is one of the most substantiated theories in ASOIAF, pretty much all that is missing is an "official" confirmation. (In case you are not familiar with it, [check this explanation video](https://youtu.be/hka-lhU-EWs)) It is - imho - a perfect ending for Sandor's story arc, not without a certain irony, but definitely fitting. What makes Sandor such a compelling character is that you have these two sides, Sandor and the Hound. Letting the Hound die, and allowing the deeply emotionally scarred Sandor to find a small measure of peace - it's a perfect ending for his character arc, and one of the few semi-happy endings we get.

But seeing how Sandor quickly became a fan favorite - for his cynical one-liners and "badass" fighting skills - the show-runners decided to bring him back, similar to how they brought Bronn back for some action buddy comedy with Jaime. Seeing Sandor go on this violet revenge spree, delivering one-liners again, etc. feel very very cheap, to the point where one might actually fear the writers might try and somehow find a reason to have "Cleganebowl" happen after all. "What is hype may never die" after all...

Maybe Sandor's arc in the show will actually have some substance beyond "yeah, totally awesome action, dude!" We will see. What we have seen so far however doesn't make me feel overly optimistic.

Please don't get me wrong, I can absolutely enjoy great action and a fair share of cynicism and one-liners, but sometimes it feels just so cheap...

There is an interesting video titled ["Blame of Thrones" by Mr BTounge on YouTube](https://youtu.be/ek2O6bVAIQQ) that is well worth watching. While I don't necessarily agree with every single detail, I think he has a very good point, especially the part titled "The Cult of the Badass".
Stannis' character and storyline and Jon's storyline. They're so bad compared to the books. 

Also no Aegon, he was cool and a much better character than Dany "Can do no wrong" Targaryan

Oh and all of season 5 and 6 were horrible especially compared to the books
Marginalization of Catelyn Stark in Seasons 2 and 3 

Cutting Arianne Martell from the show

The whole Qarth storyline of Season 2 

The anticlimactic ending to Arya's time in Braavos

Tyrion' role (or lack thereof) in Season 6


Probably Tyrion in the battle of blackwater.  The show did a pretty good job of it but Tyrion is far more ruthless in the books leading the gold cloaks into battle.

Otherwise all the character combining.  Edric Storm and Gendry are one character in the show.  This happens a lot with Freys and Lannisters.

Maester Aemons Kill the boy talk is much longer and better in the books

Although Stannis is repeatedly slighted in the show 
The half-assing of Dany's trip inside the House of the Undying.  I feel like that should have gotten an uninterrupted, half episode treatment like we later saw with the Purple Wedding and Hardhome. For obvious reasons, you omit Dany walking through the Red Wedding in the show, but there was so much great imagery in that chapter that could have been mined for the show. 

Now, if in the final two seasons, if Dany walks through a destroyed Throne Room that's covered in ash/snow, I'll be pleased with that payoff. However, this scene remains, in my opinion,  the most disappointing book to show adaptation. 
1. Rape of Sansa Stark/marriage to Ramsay Snolton 

2. Sand Snakes characterization, plot, everything 

3. Danaerys consenting to having sex with Drogo, instead of what happened in the show 

4. Cersei's dubious consent to have sex with Jaime in the sept

5. ...Mostly, the treatment of female characters and adding rape or non-consensual sex when it wasn't in the original text. 
Dorne, overall. They had every opportunity to make it interesting and worth seeing, but it ultimately felt worthless in the show. They spent multiple episodes doing stuff in Dorne / talking about Dorne and what it ultimately amounts to is Myrcella dying. Most of what happens there is totally inconsequential. Prince Doran's character doesn't matter because he doesn't change anything, and he's totally two-dimensional to begin with. And since he's such a weak character, the Sand Snakes' victory over him doesn't matter that much either. I just wasn't impressed in the end.

Doran in the books is such a great character and breathes life into one of the most fascinating side plots, one that would have totally worked with the show. They only needed to change a few things to make it "all part of the plan." Instead, we are left with the Sand Snakes, who consistently come off as reckless, unintelligent, and flat. I get what the show was trying to go for — Dany's Alliance of Strong Women (Dany, Yara, Olenna, Sand Snakes). But in the process they neutered a lot of intriguing storytelling and characters.
I like show Dorne more than book Dorne, I sorta miss book Euron for his lack of subtlety, but honestly if he's significant to the ending, he'll end up being crazy somehow. I liked I also am happy the amount of faked deaths, dyed hair, resurrections, narrow escapes, and run around betrayals is lowered. Succinctness is a strength of the show for sure, and if you want the big auteur experience of the book, its there.

I miss Victarion because him fighting the fact he loved his wife and killed her for being raped by his brother, and being unable to face it, is my favorite internal drama in the books, but without being able to read his mind, he might be a difficult character to show. I also miss the AFFC riverlands arc and Hyle Hunt. Man, introducing Hyle and Tarly at the same time, and having Sam go to Tarly like he does in the show and Brienne being there like in AFFC would have been pretty cool. I generally wish there was more Brienne run around in the show, just because there is alot of fun in there.
I also really want Iain Glen to play ADWD Jorah. Seeing handsome nice show Jorah transformed into the brutal scarred honorless sellsword with a demon's face brand on his face, who renounces his knighthood, and is unrecognizable would rule. I also would have liked to see Peter Dinklage in the scenes with Tyrion, Penny, and Jorah.
And I thought only tv Sand Snakes were panned by the viewers...
One word: Kingsmoot
I didn't like the changes they made to smalljon's character, really ruined him.
The butchery of Dorne, and of Loras's character.

There is zero justification for how badly both turned out.
The North Forgets. The Show has no trace of the Northern sentiment of loyalty and vengeance displayed by Big Bucket Wull and Lord Manderly in the books.
 
 That's the one I'm going with, but honestly I don't know how I could pick the worst between it, the Cocksmoot and show Dorne.

Treatment of a lot of secondary characters. Stannis, Coldhands, Euron, the lack of Belwas, Victarion and Aegon. 

Also how the show treats deaths in general. People just die left and right to the point that it feels ridiculous. Everyone blames George, but aside from some major moments there aren't that many deaths. I feel like it's more for shock and awe. Like Bran's story is boring enough already without you killing off everyone in it.

Also can we all just agree that Hold the door is the dumbest thing ever? That whole line of thought makes everyone in Winterfell major assholes. It means that the stopped calling him by his given name and started calling him a sound that he makes after he suffered brain damage. Can you imagine doing that in real life? Oh this is my son Daniel, but after he was kicked in the head by a horse we started calling him Durr durr. 
No Darkstar . L'épée du soir in french ( The sword of evening ) .  :/  
No Aegon
I think in the books, Jaime and Cersei had been exploring with each other and very close before her prophecy - since they were 8'ish IIRC.
Actually, from Cersei's thoughts in books, she "loves" Jaime as an extension of herself, same as her children. She see him as a part of her which is why she only loves them. Which ties in very well with being the textbook definition of a narcissist. 
When she is [spoiler] torturing the nun lady from the cult [/spoiler] she says something like, "I fuck my brother because it feels good" 

You might be right but I don't think it's as complicated as you do
They had been close since birth (when Cersei was born Jaime was holding onto her foot) and had already been caught by Joanna before visiting Maggie. 
If Cersei seduced Jaime, she also seduced herself into falling in love with him.  More to you point, Cersei loves Jaime in part because he protects her.  He is the only one who truly loves her like she deserves to be loved, he would never betray her, he is the other half to her and they make each other whole.

Except Cersei is wrong about all of that.  Jaime isn't Cersei's puppet nor is he part of her.
I think their incest proceeded the prophecy. Interesting thought though, obviously love/sex is a tool for Cersei and she's been known to use it to manipulate people. 
Nice theory, but the timeline doesn't add up. Cersei's visit to Maggy the Frog happens during the tourney hosted in Lannisport to celebrate Viserys' birth, which happens a couple of years after her mother dies in childbirth. She had already started fooling around with Jaime before their mother died (the level of activity at this point wasn't fully developed, but enough for Joanna to have their sleeping quarters separated and guards placed at Cersei's door.
I don't see why we should think that she loves her children more than anything. She says it a lot, but after Joffrey died, she was very ho-hum about her children's deaths.

I love this theory!!
I don't think she started taking the prophecy seriously until Myrcella died.  If you take "gold will be their crowns" as golden haired (because Myrcella never wore a real crown) then an easier way to dodge the prophecy would've been to have at least one child with Robert, who would have had black hair ("the seed is strong").
Arya serving Tywin at Harrenhal rather than Roose Bolton. I think it worked well and I loved their scenes together.
Aging up the characters is up there, especially the children. Even George says he made them too young. But really, they didn't have a choice since they can't stop the actors from aging. 
Not making Cat so completely unlikable.

In the books the last thing she says to Jon is that "it should have been you" while he is saying goodbye to a comatose and crippled Bran before he leaves for the Nights Watch.

I mean Jesus Christ lady...

That and adding the story of her begging the gods to cure "one of the children" and then revealing at the end of her story that it was Jon and that she did feel bad about how she had treated him over the years and considered all the horror her family was going through was the gods punishment for her being unable to love a motherless child.

I'm a fan of the scene where we find out Pod is basically a sex god. In the books he's somewhere around Arya's age, iirc, but it works in the show since Pod is years older than his book counterpart. I really think it adds an extra layer to a character who could easily be pushed to the background and also that scene is fucking hilarious! 
Petyr & Varys scenes from the first season come to mind as a great addition. 

Tywin and Olenna scenes are some strong scenes too. I don't think they were necessary in the books in the first place, I like the PoV framing device the books use. But in the adaptation with help from the charismatic actors, they are simply fantastic television.
The Chicken Scene.
 
 Renly saying "is he a ham" was golden, but I think they could have done that without cutting the peach.
The interaction between Tyrion & Oberyn. Specifically, the "I will be your champion." speech Oberyn gives Tyrion in the dungeon. Didn't happen that way in the book.
Keeping Beric alive. I like his character, and I love the idea of them becoming some sort of players in the war for the dawn. Especially with the help of Thoros.
Adding Brienne vs. The Hound, that was a great fight
Giving Bronn a larger role.
I'm glad Beric is alive. He's a cool cat. 

^^^No ^^^pun ^^^intended
Robb Stark, because of richard Madden's performance they upped his scenes in season 2 and 3, we got more Robb and it worked. in the books you see Robb from other people's perspectives mostly Cat, he's never a PoV character, I feel like him being seemingly the main good guy from season 2-3 made the RW that much more devastating.

Also the RW was brutal and with the addition of music it elevates the scene. still the only episode I cannot re watch. 
Shorter Dorne plot.
No Lady Stoneheart.  I was so disappointed when Cat came back... Dondarrion was doing important, awesome things helping the smallfolk and he gave it up so she could go on some stupid revenge streak.  Should have left her on the shore.
In the Books Robb's wife isn't pregnant or at the Red Wedding, adding those 2 touches for me having seen the show before I read the books, made that scene that much more intense for me.  
  
Swapping Sansa and "Arya" as Ramsey's wife in Winterfell. While I think that could have worked, the more I think about it, it just convoluted things while Sansa sits around at the Erye doing nothing.  
  
I wish the show was as overt with Renley/Loras' relationship as the books were. in the books their relationship is heavily implied, in the show they basically show them having sex.  
  
Also I like how the show handled Loras' "death" better.
Speeding up the process of Tyrion meeting Dany.

Conor McGregor is also in the game, so by any chance is there also a "You'll Do Fookin' Nothing" achievement?

I'm thinking it'd unlock in the event that the player does fookin' nothing in response to incoming projectiles.
Honestly, Kit Harrington being in the game is the only selling point for me.
What is the achievement for?
Don't make the mistake in thinking the story in IW is any good.

Kit has basically the role of "We want to kill everyone because we want to". Pretty black and white.
I assumed it'd be 'For the Watch' for killing the main bad.
There's also a kill streak badge called King slayer

Kit as a villian? In my mind he's kind of a British Tom Hanks, He can only play the lovable good guy. Between that and Pompeii, Kit is taking some shit roles.  
Ball sports became popular because there's so little assembly required. With soccer, all you need is a ball. Baseball is just a ball and a bat. Slightly more involved sports, like basketball, spread when public schools made gymnasiums available to your average kid. So they're inherently 'smallfolk' games.
The 'sports' we see, like jousting, are more like cross-country skiing. Expensive and exclusive. I'd imagine we haven't seen smallfolk playing sports because clinging to life as a peasant is still too time-demanding. And also, nearly every 'smallfolk' we've seen is in an active war zone, a slave, or both. Which must really cut into batting practice.

Other sports are mostly variations of kids games. 

Come-into-my-castle
Cyvasse
Finger dance
Hide-the-treasure
Hopfrog
Lord of the crossing
Monsters-and-maidens
Rats and cats
Spin-the-sword
Archery is common. Cvyasse is a chess-like game. Lord of the Crossing is a kids game.

I own all of the regular editions on Blu Rays and I'm in love with the packaging. If you buy the seasons individually and get the proper boxes then they look very nice.

I also own the Steelbooks, I'm buying more out of obsession than the actual steelbook packaging because it's nothing special.

I suggest checking out /r/DVDcollection for more information about it. :)
I own both the individual blueray releases and also the steelbooks. The steelbooks are cool to have but I have them mostly for collection purposes. The individual seasons have awesome packaging, I've always been really happy with them. They come with bluray, DVD, and digital download aswell as special features. The steelbooks have all the same features other than the DVD copies. 
The Steelbooks come with 7.1 Dolby Atmos sound, if you've got a setup for that.
I don't think there's any need to further drive home that Theon will never really be Theon again. But it would be interesting to watch them interact considering how cruel he was to her when they both thought he was the bomb-diggity. Would she twist the knife now I wonder.
What if she got pregnant and bears him an heir?

Edit: there is some evidence. When theon is getting off the boat, he says something along the lines of "I've fucked you so many times you're likely with child by now" and basically talks about how she should be proud to be pregnant with a lord's child. 
I hope he turns it around, embraces being Theon the Eunuch, and goes in to become some sort of mad warrior rampaging across the seas to Valyria.
I really want to see Theon just snap once. He can't snap on Ramsey, but just anyone. He has constantly been belittled by everyone pre-Theon 2.0. Like we see in a lot of movies where one person is so mentally damaged that they just break, Theon needs that moment. He just needs to bash someone's skull into pulp. 
I don't think she would forget getting fucked by the Son of the Lord of the Iron Islands, or his face. 
It would be an unnecessary scene.  The scene in the brothel at Volantis already conveys the same idea.  
The biggest problem is: the audience would have no clue who she was. I'd forgotten about her until this post. It would either go over most peoples' heads, or they'd need to spend too much time explaining it.
What if he impregnated her? 
Completely out of character but still funny how I imagine it: what if Theon and the ship captain's daughter met again and Theon was the exact same way to her? As if he was still deep down inside a scumbag just missing a dick?
They gave Jaime a gilded steel hand. Maybe Theon could have a golden...
I could have sworn that she was forced into prostitution or something since theon had "disgraced" her and she was like a fallen woman now. 
Well, maybe he will return to said ship only to hear that this girl died.

From what we know the captain's daughter could have died during a trading route, the sea can be harsh in the late autumn.
I think the reason the show runners decided not to do that, is because bringing that throw-away character back onto the show would require the audience to remember her face, which they won't, so without her explicitly saying "you fucked me on the ship" everyone just be confused about who the girl is, because they forgot what she looked like.
She is in kings landing I am pretty sure. One of Littlefinger's women. Or it could just be that the actress was hired again for another scene in KL. 
Woof that scene was awkward to watch with the rents.
I often find myself wishing I were Theon's salt wife.  What is dead may never die!  We do not sow!
Pretty sure that was the same actress they used in kings landing in that scene with Joffrey beating those prostitutes
Haven't read the OP, but I assume you're talking about me. 
> arrogant egotist

In defense mode!
I honestly thought she was good looking, I would have taken her as a salt wife. 
Pretty cool but those spikes are way too long to be swords.  They are clearly over 6 feet long and thats being conservative.  
not enough money to portray the world according to Simonetti.

He only needs some identifier, it doesn't have to be their real name. 

"The one who tortures everyone"  
"A man needs a name"  
"They call him the tickler"  
"That is enough"

Jaqen H'ghar is enough to identify him, so it's enough. 
I don't know what exactly you want a link to, but we "know" it's his name because he told us (Arya) that it was his name.  The Faceless Men train to become "No One" by studying and learning many techniques to help aid them in serving the Man Faced God.  The idea being that to successfully become a Faceless Man you need to be able to change your entire persona to completely become someone else, and if you still have ties to who you were it may result in tells, micro expressions, the wrong emotion at certain situations, any number of issues that would keep you from being able to serve the MFG.

We know that Jaqen H'ghar wore his first face for a very long time (at least the entire timespan of the first 2 and a half books), and then wore his second face for a very long time (at least the entire timespan of the latter 2 and a half books of the series).  So we cannot reasonably determine whether his face as Jaqen H'ghar is actually him or a mask, nor can we tell if the second face Arya sees is actually his or if it's a mask. The same with the name he gives.  Though if we're to try to apply some logic one might assume he was wearing the mask the entire time and then finally took it off, since he couldn't have carried another mask with him the entire time he was in prison. With that said, I would hesitate to try to use logic while trying to figure out a Faceless Man, it still seems there's much we do not know yet.

Jon won't have to make a choice, he's a targ and a stark by blood and knows what lies beyond the wall. He will bend the knee to Dany. 

Varys is actively working to get the Targs back on the other hand littlefinger only wants himself on the iron throne. I could see Baelish underestimating Danys army and the Vale losing big to the targs which might prompt the high born of the vale to oust littlefinger (they just need a reason they all hate him already) 
I personally feel like he'll join Dany, just because I think it's basically gonna be like what happened with the first men. The Starks were King of the north and they laid down when the targs came in on dragons 
I just finished today also. Feels like LotR + God Father. 

Still can't get over that scene "Hold the door!" ;_;
awesome man! that's so much fun to finish a series and know there is more to come. Binge watching is the BEST! 

Yeah, my take is they get married. Hook up, something. Read the books. Different. But nuts and bolts are the same and end game will be the same. 
I'm a bit rusty but refresh my memory: Do we know forsure that he is a Targaryen or just that he is Lyanna's and it is likely that he is a Targaryen?
Actually, I can totally see Jon marrying Sansa. But then again, I can also imagine Dany marrying Jon to get his men's support and then killing him - "poisoned by his enemies".

The only people who could truly testify to Jon's parentage were Ned, Ser Arthur Dayne and his companion and the two maids. No one else actually experienced the sequence of Rhaegar's "kidnapping" of Lyanna, Lyanna's pregnancy and birth of Jon, confirming Lyanna Stark as his mother and Rhaegar Targaryan as his father, Bran's visions and HBO's infograph notwithstanding. Howland read did not make it up the stairs nor did he enter the room and he probably fainted from loss of blood and shock and didn't regain consciousness for a day or two and can't really say that Jon is Lyanna's and Rhaegar's son.
With Ned and Ser Arthur and his Companion dead, only the two maids are left. 
Bran's vision not withstanding, Jon is now a Stark, legitimized by the Northern Lords when they acclaimed him King ("whose name is Stark"). Arya and Sansa are his half-sisters.
Jon Stark, King in the North, will bend the knee to Danerys Stormborn because Cersei will never ally with a Stark or condone an independent Northern kingdom, where Danerys could grant the North autonomy or maintain it as a subordinate kingdom, but best of all, bring her's and the South's resources to focus on the real danger beyond the Wall. 
There is tension between Jon and Sansa. But Sansa has no chance of being Queen in the North. The Northern Lords, even the matriarchal Mormonts, will not recognize a woman as a ruling queen. And with Jon legitimized, she cannot be Lady Stark of House Stark and Lady of Winterfell. She can, however, influence Jon, she is the widow of Ramsey Bolton, which gives her title to the Bolton lands and Dreadfort. And there is her connection with the South, in that in the eyes of the Faith, she is still the wife of Tyrion Lannister, as the marriage, while not consummated, has not been annulled. 
Littlefinger is conspiring to put himself on the Iron Throne. If he is working with Varys, it is only so that he can set up the needed scenarios that lead him to the crown.
Robert Baratheon did not kill the last Targaryan King, Jaimie Lannister did. Robert killed the Heir Apparent, Prince Rhaegar. 
Unfortunately season 6 was god awful. 

Real shame what happened to the show
>When Aerys saw the blood on his blade, he demanded to know if it was Lord Tywin's. "I want him dead, the traitor. I want his head, you'll bring me his head, or you'll burn with all the rest. All the traitors. Rossart says they are inside the walls! He's gone to make them a warm welcome. Whose blood? Whose?"
 
>"Rossart's," answered Jaime.
 
>Those purple eyes grew huge then, and the royal mouth drooped open in shock. He lost control of his bowels, turned, and ran for the Iron Throne. Beneath the empty eyes of the skulls on the walls, Jaime hauled the last dragonking bodily off the steps, squealing like a pig and smelling like a privy. **A single slash across his throat was all it took to end it**. So easy, he remembered thinking. A king should die harder than this. Rossart at least had tried to make a fight of it, though if truth be told he fought like an alchemist. Queer that they never ask who killed Rossart . . . but of course, he was no one, lowborn, Hand for a fortnight, just another mad fancy of the Mad King.
"I stabbed him in the back as he was trying to run away. I don't think he was expecting to die...He thought he'd be reborn a dragon...I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen." Sorry I'm para phrasing as Jaime told the story. He was feverish and about to black out so... 

In the books he slit he's throat direct from Jaime. Stories are told and re-told...We've learned to not trust "accounts" of these things book or show.  
He stabbed him in the back , then slit his throat to be sure of it
jaime says that he stabbed him in the back then slit his throat because aerys expected to be reborn as a flame breathing dragon.

Im pretty sure he did both

The flashback scene in the show shows Jamie stabbing the Mad King in the back. 
I didn't make these, I'm just a fan :)

Here is a link to the tremendous artist.
http://orkimides.deviantart.com/gallery/

Somebody needs to make a game with these characters. Like now. 
I didn't realize I wanted a Fire Emblem x Game of Thrones game until just now. 
This is awesome. Needs Barristan Selmy, Tormund & and Arthur Dayne though.
Left to right, top to bottom:

Jon, Ned, Robert, Hound, Cersei

Mountain, Jamie, Theon, Loras, Walker

Robb, Tyrion, Drogo, Mel, Arya

Joffrey, Stannis, Brienne, Gendry, Dany

Bran and Hodor, Oberyn, Ygritte, Ramsay, Grey Worm

Jorah Mormont, Varys, Littlefinger, Yara/Asha, ~~Barristan Selmy~~ Tywin Lannister

Syrio Forel, Pyatt Pree, Jaquen, Sam, Septa Unella

This looks fucking awesome.

...if the artist makes all the spritesheets and animations and such I'd be totally down to make this video game.
I love that Arya and Syrio have the same pose
Anyone miss when Fire Emblem had these awesome pixel style graphics?
Kind of reminds me of Fire Emblem characters. 
I was thinking more old school rpg than fighting game. 
Gregor looks like such a good final boss.
Game of Thrones characters in 16 bit? Westerosi Street Fighter? 

This is the kind of stuff I want to see. Seriously, more of this and less cosplay please. 
This reminds me of all the joy i got from playing FFVI and Chrono Trigger. I'd totally play the shit out of a GOT JRPG.
I get the feeling shame nun would be overpowered
Where is SANSA??!!
Where is the legendary Karl fookin Tanner?
Shirtless Ramsay OP, Devs pls nerf
I would use the shit out of Melisandre and Daenerys cause I was once a gay kid who strictly picked the most fabulous female characters in every game I played.  I still do but I'm like an adult or whatever now.  
RPG/Strategy mix could be amazing, great sprites.
Is it just me, or does Bran look like Mokuba? 
Littlefinger vs. Samwell Tarly ... FIGHT!

Have we actually seen Littlefinger fight physically in the series anywhere?  He led an army to the Battle of the Bastards, and that's the closest thing I can remember, but did he actually fight with it?
so like someone needs to put this on MUGEN
I love the Septa's inclusion there. What would that fight be like?

"Septa used SHAME!"

"It's super effective!"
I don't need it...... I don't need it
Damn this reminds me a lot of the game called Dragonforce for the SEGA Saturn.
Ferra/Torr style play from Hodor and Bran would be pretty entertaining 
Really reminds me of Battle for Wesnoth, thanks for sharing OP
I believe you meant to say Pixel art for an upcoming Final Fantasy Tactics like game based in Westeros right?
It all seems fun until you have to draw 50 frames of animation for each character. 
It makes me sad because I'll never see a JRPG about Game of Thrones.
Stannis looks super badass though. Giant flaming sword? Awesome.
I would play the fuck out of this.
I love how Arya and Syrio have the exact same stance. 
I always explained GoT to my parents as 삼국지 but western version. That's Korean for Three Kingdoms for some of you who aren't aware. I'd be down for a Dynasty Warrior style or 2D RPG game.
Pixel art is the fucking best
Looks like Fire Emblem characters
If someone here is making an old school "Street fighter esque" game using GOT characters. Hit me up, I will do all the free beta testing you need!!!! And I would play the shit out of the final version.
Something about this type of high-density/heavily shaded pixel art is just like porn for my nostalgia center. I can't stop looking at it, drinking in every detail, imagining them in motion in a game, I love it.

Note: Way over NES level pixel art though, ugh. Maybe it's just emblematic that I grew up in the SNES and PS1 era so that style is what I appreciate more. 
Mountain, walker, Dany. Thats my line up
Collab to make this game?
Can we applaud OP for such a great work on this! *slow clap* 
God if this happened I would be so happy! 
I would kill to play this game, then spend as much time as humanly possible to unlock Syrio.
Nothing shy of excellent.  Bravo!
Those are actually pretty, and I was proud of myself for naming [almost] all of them, which also means you did a good job if you look at it that way.
Fwiw, this graphic is the most I've like Stannis in the history of the show. 
Did anyone else name all of them, but think to yourself "who is the dude with the blonde hair and golden armor?"

Checked the comments to see who it was.  Was pleasantly amused by the answer.
Why this is game fictional!

Mmm... remember the Japanese RPG? remember the 2D scroller games with beautiful art? Hmm.. Remember how cool and simple games used to be and it was all about the story? Remember no download content? Remember the keyboard controls and switching off your gaming monitor?... 
I can't express how amazing this is great job op for posting this and made respect to the creator!
you found Gendry!  Where was he?
Love it, especially the Tywin one for some reason.  The art and color style reminds me a lot of Final Fantasy Tactics.  
I need a high res of these so i can zoom in for my contacts on my phone :P 

Edit can't even zoom in far enough on them to make them a contact icon without getting others in the picture :(((( makes me sad 

I would Kickstart the shit out of this.
Favorite touch: Syrio and Arya have the same stance
Varys' combat consists of telling his opponents facts they didn't know he knew about their mothers.
Where is my man Arthur Dayne?
THESE WOULD BE PERFECT FOR A FFT RESKIN! 
OP, did you make these?

Edit: nm I see that you did not
kind of reminds me of little fighter 1 and 2!
Gendry needs oars to fight with 
Someone has got to use these designs for some pearler bead art. 
I would love this as an arpg
I see Robert Baratheon, but I don't see the boar. :)
Make this now someone. I want to be able to play it on my phone
Give us a skyrim type game of thrones game that is multiplayer and I will live in peace 
Needs more Strong Belwas
Where's Barristan?

That would be so dope. 
I love how Varys weapon is just a little bird. 
This is beautiful!! Are you the artist? Where can I see more of your/their work?
stronk 5/7, i'd play that
Thanks for the new mobile wallpaper! Brienne is front and center,  looking good in her OG "Renley" armor. 

But where's my main man Reek???
I like Ramsay's plot armor.
Great job. 
I was excited to see Brienne but...
10/10 would play

So badass. 
How would the stats with Hodor be compared to the Mountain? Power/Speed/HP?
This is dope 
Looks like fire emblem sprites 
5/7, not enough Tormund
he probably couldn't afford the extra pixels to show the wolves.  :(   

[found some](https://i.imgur.com/uo5skm6.jpg)
This made me realize, have we ever seen cersei kill someone? Like with her own hands? (Not getting someone else to do it).
Great. Now I need a fighting game.
Ramsay looks like Bruce Lee
Can we!? PLEASE!?
Pyatt Pree got some strong Voldemort vibe going on 
Cersi's ultimate ability would be wildfyre clearly 
I'm gonna perler bead the shit out of these.
Holy crap! I want this to happen!
Poor Hodor! Get him out of there!
Bran being paralyzed is totally spoiled by the fact that he's riding Hodor
That Stannis though
Cersei's facial expression alone should do some damage- she looks fierce 
Oh man i can hear the combo. "Shame!" *WHACK* "Shame!!" *Whack-THUMP* "SHAAAAME!!!!!" *Street Fighter II death FX.* *Ding-Ding-Ding* ULTRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA COMBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Jon is missing Ghost. 
Yet more things to make the show appear kid friendly, when the show is most definitely not for kids.
Shirtless Ramsay S+ Tier
Karl Tanner all the way! 😅
Reminds me of little fighter
Get in contact OP and we'll see what game ideas we can agree upon.
Badass.
Yo, this is Valkyrie Profile like, fantastic
For a joke, could you add a headless Ned Stark as a bonus character?
I found my character. Shame. Shame. Shame. 
one word MUGEN!
I'm down with any game that lets me fight as Syrio Forel.
These are absolutely adorable! Well done
Is it Bran or Hodor or maybe bran/hodor I prefer the branador.
Crazy that I know most of these instantly. Just goes to show how the HBO series has given the characters such life and that whoever made these is a fuckin' pixel boss!
Yara/Asha with her husband and child. Good detail
No Daario? :(
Mother of Dragons op please nerf
Huh, why is Cersei in it? She's too OP, full screen 1 shot wild fire ultimate.
Did I miss Tormund?
Yooooooooo
Fire emblem
Yoooo this is dope af
I figured out who fatty is
Dope
Benjen?
Who's the shirtless guy with 2 daggers. ?
The tier list and movesets would cause arguments to no end. I can see so many people saying Brienne, Oberyn and the Mountain are S rank while Tyrion and Arya are god tier due to their height, speed and special. 
What the fuck is wrong with little finger in that? 
Final Fantasy tactics!
Reminds me of samurai showdown. 

Yes. Yes I would like this. 
Anyone else hoping for a LSH sprite?
If someone makes a game with this, my life would be complete. 
I'd play the shit out of this if it were a game.  Especially if it was like a choose your adventure type game, what choices you make decide how the story plays out.  
Now someone either make this an RPG that tells the story through multiple arcs and you switch between who you control and members in your party! 

Or make it a fighter. Up to 4 players a la super smash 
I would buy and pay the shit out of this! The drawings are great!
I love The Spider here. I miss the fucking show. 
Haha even has old nan
This reminds me of Suikoden 2. Fitting. A great PS1 game meets a great TV show. :)
I've loved the idea of a Game of Thrones fighting game, similar to Soul Caliber. 
These are incredibly good. I would love to play a GoT FFTactics game like this. 

I got extremely pissed off the moment I saw Joffrey's sprite though... 
Oh i love this!   10/10 would play! 
A man looks absolutely incredible. 
Reminds me of Suikoden style of art. At least the first two games.
No Margaery :(
Make a mod for battle for WESNOTH.
Release date?
Little fighter 2?!?
Totally reminds me of ragnarok online omg
Why does Theon still have a cock?
I was a fookin LEGEND in Gin Alley!!!
o.o
Do you think Robert in his prime would win in a fight with the Mountain? 
Dragon Tamer Daenerys would like to battle.
jorah took me a minute
These make me insanely happy
I'm Igritte!
these are pretty cool
No Barristan, Tormund or Daario but Septa Unella, Littlefinger and Varys are present?
Robert Baratheon VERSUS Cersei Lannister
FIGHT

[Ep1.06](#s "*SMACK*")

[Ep1.06](#s ""Wear it in silence or I'll honor you again"")

[Ep1.07](#s "Cersei uses BOAR ATTACK")

[Ep1.07](#s ""You win or you die!"")

VICTORY
If he dies we find a red priest.
I saw somewhere that he revealed to the show producers the whole plot, and how he expected to end it.
GRRM would finish them. ;)
He has said that he won't let anyone else finish the books. I really don't know at what point, his wishes can be disregarded. Its very possible that we will never see A Dream of Spring. I wouldn't be surprised if he just said that as a fuck you to the people talking about his death like the only relevance would be him not finishing the story.
If he dies, he dies. 
He had a backup plan , he told D&D everything.

We get that really good Melisandre cosplay from a few days ago and see what she can actually do.
Valar Morghulis
Weeping and gnashing of teeth.
What is dead may never die
I'm confident that there's enough people that know enough about the books, the arcs, and the endgame that the important resolutions will come out.  There is Elio and Linda that wrote AWOIAF with GRRM, Dan and Dave producing the show with access to as yet unknown information, various book editors and probably many more less well known cogs in the machine that is ASOIAF.  We all hope the best for GRRM and that he may see many more name days, but should the gods see fit to take him I'm sure there are mechanisms in place to satiate the fans. Valar Morghulis.
We'll rape his fucking corpse!
[deleted]
I assume his book contracts and/or some estate planning would stipulate what happens in the event of his death. If he's said he wouldn't allow anyone else to finish them, then maybe he's put things in place to ensure that no one ever can. But after an author is dead, obviously it's harder for them to control their works. A trust administered by one or more trustees might be able to manage his works as he prefers.
He's only 68 I have faith lol

Well my first thought was that if he died someone would ghost write it,im sure he has a framework written down for how he wants the books to end and the important plots leading upto it,its just the wording he is perfecting.But ive read that upon his death it is all supposed to be destroyed.

Now with the amount of money involved i wouldnt be shocked if there were subpoenas issued stopping the burning of it and it was eventually ghost written.

With the reports he was on his final draft for this book a year ago i hope he has finished it and is half way thru the last book and he is planning on releasing them back to back 
not today
That would be one hell of a plot twist.
We all bitch and moan and accept that at the very least, the show was completed. I still think the books are better and am looking forward to reading his story in his own prose through hundreds of pages, but I have doubts that he'll finish.
Not Brian Sanderson
*when not if

[deleted]
Most people have forgotten about magic, the Others, and the Children by this time, so it's a matter of feeling secure. Benjen probably knew about it after the Children saved him
> This is of course, assuming that they don't have the Horn of Winter. How likely is it that they have that?

Mance certainly was never able to find it, despite trying for years. Mance claims he found it, and has a very impressive looking horn that he claims to be the Horn of Winter, which Melisandre eventually burns. Tormund later tells Jon that Mance never found the horn, and the one Melisandre burned was a fake. It's possible they were unable to find it all that time because the Others had it all along.
Bran has been touched by the night king now too... If he crosses, they can cross
Wights were able to be raised in castle black, so at least some magic can make it through.. 
So basically, get everyone we need, go to mole's town, grab an ale and wait for all this to blow over!
Bran ex machina
In the show, Sam and his fellow latrine diggers find a marker with several "dragonglass" blades and spear points, along with a horn, wrapped in a Night's Watch cloak. Sam still has the horn at Oldtown. This could be the "Horn of Winter", it could be "Dragonbinder", Euron could sack Oldtown as he makes his way around the western coast of Westeros and get the horn. We'll have to wait and see what happens.
The main question is if the mark the Night King put on Bran which broke the protective spells of the Cave will do the same to the Wall.

Well, your opinion like mine is subjective.

I find her a great character. To think of all she has done since season 1 is pretty incredible. She turned an arranged marriage with Drogo into an actual loving relationship. She has managed to conquer cities and gain armies all with her smarts (plus the help of others)

She has used Tyrion to her advantage something major. And now has the whole Dothraki army behind her. She's made some good moves, some stupid moves but who hasn't.

I'm really looking forward to seeing her interact with the other characters when she makes it to Westeros.
"We all know" 

No. 
Daenerys is one of the most popular characters in the show. Don't project.
But I like Dany
In the show she's 25. In the books she's 14. The show version is notably dumber because she has to behave like her book counterpart.
She's like in her early/mid teens in the books.

Hell, I think she's too badass in the books for her age. The way she tricked the three sellsword companies of Yunkai was definitely not something a teenager with almost no battle experience can do. 

In the show, Dany's strategy was much more subtle and makes more sense looking at what her experience is. Her stay at Qarth taught her that power is a tool, once you get it, you can do whatever you want (as Daxos has shown). The Astapori stunt was very reminiscent of her stint in Qarth. The Yunkish stunt where she depended on her advisors to make decision makes more sense than the book, and the Meereen stunt is a pretty good power play to show the slaves that their lack of power is an illusion. She doesn't have the ships in the books, so the ballistae can't really happen.

Whatever. The point is that she wins her own battles in the books AND the show. The only difference is that in the show she relies more on others while in the books she's a force onto herself.
I don't think Dany is a bad character, I think she's a great character. Her storyline is cool and in the books, her chapters were more enjoyable to read than Tyrion's.

I think what it comes down to is that her story is initially built upon these epic, monumental moments that really hook people into the show. Crown of gold, dragons, Dracarys, etc. However, when it gets down to Seasons 4, 5 and to some extent 6 (though it picks up after a while), her story gets a lot more political and a lot less "epic", which may be why people don't like Dany. I don't think Emilia Clarke is a bad actor. She's good in my book, but there's of course way better actors on the show and way worse actors on the show. 

The immune to fire thing is pretty stupid, but whatever if that's how they want to take it then so be it. 
I like her personality, which she's not overly violent she's doing good.

But in both books and shows I hate her fucking storylines:

Here have an army

Expended those dothraki down to like 2 dozen, here have another army.

Now take cities

Expended some of those boys fighting harpies? Don't have enough to take westeros anymore?

HERE HAVE ANOTHER FUCKING ARMY


So basically I don't like her magical fucking aura that makes sure she always has enough people
Whether she's as bad in the books is very subjective. I like her more in the books, but then I like just about all the characters more in the books.
 
 Burning the Khals hasn't happened in the books, and the way she meets the Dothraki at the end of ADWD is very different to the way she meets them at the end of S5. Drogon is in full strength beside Dany feasting on charred horse with her. I think she'll burn some Khals, but she'll do it by dragon not brazier, and it won't be at Vaes Dothrak. But I thought that already after reading ADWD, season 6 of the show has nothing to do with that prediction.
Season 6 doesn't have a corresponding book out yet. 
As an avid Dany hater, I will say Denis handled better in the books. Get a better sense of her inner conflict and desires. At the end of the day she is just a girl who has been told all her life that her home is somewhere far off that she needs to conquer, but what she really wants is her house with red door back
Definitely not. Dany is one of my favorite characters in the books. I hate her in the show. I think that comes down to Emilia's bad acting and the fact that the showrunners have no idea what her storyline is supposed to be about, so it just becomes about badass girl power.

Also, nothing like that scene where she burned all the khals happened in the books, and nor will it. David and Dan came up with that themselves.

Ahh you would love the im a young girl and new to the way of things line 
I hate show Daenarys. She fucking sucks.

Book Daenarys is better but I still find her chapters quite dull.
It's Walder Frey

[sea mine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cun-LZvOTdw)
For those who don't know, in addition to playing a cowardly, despicable man in Walder Frey, David Bradley also plays a badass, vampire hunting Holocaust survivor as Dr Abraham Setrakian in FX's The Strain. It's really a testament to how great of an actor he is and I just thought I'd show him a little appreciation for this.
William Hartnell anyone? (An Adventure in Space and Time)
[Jack Marshall](http://www.antena3.com/clipping/2014/09/24/00399/30.jpg), the newsagent in Broadchurch.
"Students out of bed! Students out of bed!!!!!!"
Hmm. We must retrive the Ocido Lumen.
While I love his work as Walder Frey (he played him as such a delightfully despicable sonofabitch), his work in season 1 of *Broadchurch* (which is on Netflix, and I would highly recommend) might be my favorite performance of his.

Hes great. Love him on FX's "The Strain", he plays a Jewish vampire hunting Holocaust survivor named Abraham Setrakian. It's not the best show ever but its good fun.
Oh man, I love this scum bag. And I mean that in all the best ways possible. It takes talent to pull off a character that drips with sleaze, without making said character be comical. Good work David Bradley. You will be missed.
I saw him as The Innkeeper (Thenardier) in Les Miserables. He's a genius.
Watch broadchurch 
Honestly? I absolutely loved him as King Henry VIII's 'Fool' in The Tudors. I feel like he's very underappreciated for that role. Plus it has an awesome scene with him wearing a crown cackling.
Jesus. The Light of the Seven one is incredible. I play piano decently well but that level is insane. Props to him.
Listening to The Light of the Seven again just reminds me of how amazing/beautiful/awesome that whole sequence was in the show. Think it has to be my all time favorite part in the entire series so far - the combo of the music and editing just worked so well.

I think its the end if season 7 scene kinda like the scept in WoW. I think thats the big 1 up scene they have this year
Hopefully the fall is gradual enough for Edd to have time to get away.
(the youtubers commentary was annoying as hell).
Plus I doubt the entire 300miles of the wall will fall. If anything there probably will be a breach in the wall, big enough for armies of the dead to get through. 

[deleted]
What if this whole time the Nights King has just been trying to collect enough dead to climb the wall!!!

The first or second episode will be Bran crossing the threshold into Westeros and to do so he will have to pass through the wall. But the thing is - Bran is marked by the Night King. Who is to say the cave's magic that kept the Others at bay is not the same as the Wall's magic? They were both associated with Children of the Forest. I believe by this season's finale, the wall will fall.
Probably  
Yes, it will. 
I hope so and I think it will be absolutely magnificent. And probably very sad because our last couple of friends at the wall may not survive.
I think one way or another it will fall.
Wouldn't that mean that the wall has failed it's original purpose?
I think this season will focus on Dany taking the throne and will end with Winter arriving and the wall possibly falling. Then the final season would be Dany, Jon,  whoever is still alive fighting the white walkers.
The wall WILL fall.

Danny's saw the future in which the Iron Throne(Kings' Landing) was covered in snow.

The Night King will sit on the Iron Throne!
The wall has to fall to keep creating conflict. Sam has to be the answer to creating more valeryian steel and arming people with weapons against the walkers OR helping Jon realize he's the prince who was promised.

I think Jon may die to save everyone else unfortunately.

Very thorough and I like the almost story book-esque animations throughout! 
Jaqen H'ghar at a job interview. That would be so awkward considering he's 'no one'.
Seth invites Stannis to a dinner party...it would be hilariously awkward.

Have a sketch of Arya doing a cooking show, this could also work with Ramsay.

Do a Game of Thrones fantasy draft , with people picking Game of Thrones characters for their sports teams.

Jon Snow on Jeopardy...predictably he knows nothing.

Slapping Joffrey...not a sketch...just would enjoy seeing it again.

Anything with dolorous edd as Lord commander. Preferably the wall coming down
We already have a SNL skit, that was the mummers portrayal of recent Westerosi history we saw in Season 6.
These "reports" have been circulating around for at least two years now. Outside of an official press release that reveals the street date, I'd take anything that reads like this with a grain of salt. Most of the time, these articles are just lazy attempts by people to get easy clicks and views.
Oh my god my heart jumped when I read that title.

But obviously it's false.
DON'T YOU BE PULLING MY DICK, BRO. 
"such a delay may also affect the production Of the show", wtf? Lol
> The rumors were set in motion when an Amazon France website listed the book’s release date as March 9, 2017. The page, however, has since been taken down, the Independent reported. Random House, Voyager/Harper Collins Books — the publishers — denied that a release date has been set and reportedly said that the public will be informed immediately once the decision was made.

Goddamit, another false report
"They check's in the mail, I swear."
Rubbish!!
GRRM has said more than once he will announce it on his blog when it is done. Until such time, none of these people who continue to make these articles know anything.
I so want this to be true
Until George comes out and says something personally, all reports are bullshit.  
Hope it wasn't rushed 
Clickbait, sorry.  The actual article doesn't quote a source for the "being proofread" part or which "Reports say", just regurgitates that Amazon France rumour that it's due out next March.  So really, this is an update to basically say we don't know anything new, but thanks for clicking.
How many years average does he take per book?
Doesn't GRRM give the finished parts to his publisher in advance to proofread? 
I'll believe it when the book is in my hand.
Nothing to see here, but hype and what is hype may never die.
He has already said numerous times that when he's done writing he'll tell us.
this was a dud click bait that said nothing.

If he releases b4 the end of GoT, it won't happen until after S7 IMO
Is it bad I don't want the book released just yet so I can finish my reread of the series? (I'm half way through ASOS)

Why didn't you rotate the image? Are you new to computers? 
Guess he wasn't his father's son.

Because we know Robb would've done it.
Not sure if that's foreshadowing or just a hint.

He wasn't.
Read  " He raised Longclaw." To "Wasn't He"
Not really. Overpopulation is really a condition that applies to the living in which there are too many people and not enough resources. The white walkers don't eat, don't need shelter or clothing. They would just need space. 

The white walkers are invading because they're a weapon gone awry. The first children made them as a defense mechanism against man. They are out of control now and just killing everything.
My theory: global warming.
"There's like, four of us. Come on guys, time to get more space!" 


Nope. They invadad because they sensed that Pure Evil climbed the throne in KL.

They woke from their long slumber to save humanity because that is the task they were built for.

It is known.
Is it ever confirmed that the Night King and White Walkers are immortal though?
Since HBO told us that the Night's King is in the weirdwood net, I thought they saw the dragons comming.
Like, Daenerys thinks Westeros is hers. The Wall marks the 7 kingdons, but the far north is still Westeros anyway. Khaleesi don't fear anything. 
They have a reason to come south. We just don't know what it is. They can't reproduce so killing everything's not a option. GRRM also said that the Night's King from the show is NOT the same as the one from legends their not immortal. He also said there was a reason for the strange seasons in weather that would be sorted by the end. Summers so long it caused droughts and food shortages to winters lasting a lifetime. "Imbalance" is all we know  
One reason why the nights watch kill wildlings can also be that they try to make sure theres not so many dead that can rise if the white walkers ever come back, but over the years they forgot the real reason and it more or less just became tradition.

The Walkers are like a weaponised virus. They were 'programmed' to kill. Invading is a conquest for them, just like when first men invaded and slaughtered the children for conquest. 
A co-worker looks exactly like the waif.
Wait.. is that really the actress?
Is this not the actual Waif?
That's an uncanny resemblance. She must've had people telling her for months that she needed to be her for Halloween. 
"It's not scary, Lacy, I just don't like being touched."
She looks way too real haha
She looks TOO much like The Waif. It's creeping me the fuck out.
Nice.

Here is [Faye Marsay](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CoAhRZbUkAAEpJy.jpg), The Waif actress in real life.
Saw the user name and couldn't figure out what this had to do with church. Then I realized which subreddit I was in...
A girl will obey
Is that the Waifu?
If the girl in this phots is *not* the waif actress, could they be long lost identical twins?

parents gave one up for adoption?
I really liked the Waif. She was tough as shit and rode Arya hard, but Arya needed it. Drill Instructors are tough for a reason. 
I'd make her a blade of the darkmoon
I've always thought the Waif was kinda attractive
waif

noun

a homeless and helpless person, especially a neglected or abandoned child.
"she is foster-mother to various waifs and strays"
synonyms:	ragamuffin, urchin; More
She could be a mean Matt Smith too
The weak should fear the strong.

Aww man the waif is working IT now? Guess people gonna die

I would 
The other lady looks like the red head (arlene?) from True Blood
Thought this was a behind the scenes photo. That's an insane resemblance.
maybe it's the hairstyle because the actress that plays the waif looks different on White Queen and everything else she's been in

Well that was garbage 
Every time I think about that Mormont shield that Jon used against Ramsay I smile and remember the little bear Lady Lyanna talking about how every man from Bear Island fights with the strength of ten other men and after all the slaughter of the BoB at least 1 of the 62 bear island warriors made it into Winterfell.
"Fewer."
"What the fuck's a Lommy?"
I love the scene where Arya and the Hound are eating the farmer's daughter's stew. They're slurping and gulping like a couple of pigs. Arya catches herself, looks up and musters up what bit of a lady she has in her and says, "this is really good". 
When a Dothraki guy and Jorah Mormont talk about their differences in armour and fighting. I find it really cute.
My favourite small detail is the wildling mother in the episode Hardhome. They gave her a story arc in the matter of 10 minutes of screen time and it really stuck out to me on my secon watch. She sends her children away and that is the last sight she has of them. When the wights break through the children wights stand in front of her children are the only thing she sees making her unable to respond, this is what kills her.

My favorite Moment is when Cersei threatens Tywin with revealing her incest with Jaime. There's a scene where Tywin looks at her puzzled and Cersei takes a moment to respond something along the lines of "You don't know it, do you?". It's her facial expression that tells so much as she enjoys the one moment in her life when the tables have turned and Cersei has something to blackmail Tywin. Excellent acting from Charles Dance and Lena Headey.
Possibly my favorite moment/monologue in the show, made even more special by the fact that it did not happen in the books, is Yoren's speech to Arya about his brother, and Willem, his brother's killer. This is where she gets her list of names idea from, and just such a beautifully written and acted dialogue!
It must be Lyanna Mormont letter she wrote to Stannis, also her face to Ramsay, and the fact that she went with their army, and not just sit in her castle. I mean, if she survives and she'll grow into fearsome, fantastic, honorable leader. But this is GOT world we're talking about.
In the BoB when Jon picks up a Mormont shield to defend himself against Ramsay's arrows. It's been mentioned a million times. I just think it's awesome that one of the Mormont soldiers made it that far. 
Brienne and Tormund!! An island of cuteness and joy in a sea of turmoil and bloodshed and incest and doors
Happy shitting 
honestly a great one for me is in the first episode, as the camera is moving through the room with the ladies doing crochet or knitting or whatever style it is, and Arya is looking around distracted because *you can faintly hear the sounds of a bow firing*.

when I first watched this show I was way too high to notice that shit. but it pretty much sets up Arya completely beyond the whole "magical assassin" thing.
Tyrion's story/joke about a donkey and a brothel being interrupted twice, with the two instances being several seasons apart from each other is amazing.
I don't have one in the show but Gylbert Farwynd's appearance in the kingsmoot always makes me laugh. I just adore the character.

Brienne has her shield repainted and describes one seen in her fathers shield hall to the artist. 

The sigil is that of Ser Duncan the Tall. 
Lyannas letter to Stannis and Jon smiling at it.
"..you made sure of [further conflict] when you chopped off Ned Stark's head. That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation."  - Tyrion

Cut to the acting troupe on stage in season six...

(Fart noises)
"hundreds will die!"

"Thousands."

I was happy Needle was still where Ayra hid it.  After Sexy Jesus returned the coin she threw in the water, I thought for sure he would know about her hiding the sword.
It's so sad she never had the chance to say goodbye to her father. Season 1 has definitely set the moral ground of the whole story...
It's my favorite chapter from the first book as well ! 
My heart still breaks for Ned after all this time. :'-( Yeah, he was no Littlefinger, but who really would be, and that was his appeal. It'd be terrible, pointless fanservice, but I kind of wish they'd bring him back for some flashbacks.

The first season was pretty identical to the book.  After that it really started making its own way in explaining the events.  It has to because the time it would take to follow the books accurately would make it 15 seasons long and many watchers would get bored.  Pacing is extremely important in both cinema and literature but they are both paced differently.  The show had to be different from the books in order to maintain that pacing to keep the audience interested. 
Because it's still a great TV show despite it not having everything that book readers (such as myself) want. I personally except the differences (except Dorne of course) and I'm kinda glad that the show and books are diverging because it means I get to experience two phenomenal stories. 


The acting is fantastic for big and small roles. The writing is mostly great despite a noticeable drop in quality every now and again. The directing is amazing and the special effects get more and more unbelievably great every season. Plus, who doesn't get eargasms from Ramin's score.


Anyway, I'm a book reader and I fucking love this show.


Edit: Cinematography is incredible too
As a person who read the books and watched the show, I actually like the show better. The books were great, but somewhere around book 4 they just started dragging out and kept adding more characters. The only part I disliked about the show was botching the Dorne plot and having Loras the only male heir to Highgarden. They sort of backed themselves into a corner and destroyed two major houses. Other than that, I liked cutting out LSH and the Aegon plotline. Game of Thrones overtook Lost for me as the best TV show ever. With the exception of the first book, ASOIAF isn't close to the best books I have ever read. Oh well though. 
I think the fantasy world coupled with struggles of humanity is a great plot. Its not Men vs. Orcs, its men vs. men. And because of that it portrays the struggles and the inner desires of men (and women). How they each have to play a 'game' with each other to get what they want.

Yes theres white walkers but technically those are men too, and you get some bad ass battles towards the end of the show (I hope).
I'm also a book fan who watched the show first and it just seems to me that a lot of book readers decide they will hate the show just because it is moving away from the books. I just don't get it, I accept that they're two different things (accept the ending which will apparently be the same) and love them both.
https://youtu.be/2JJnL-kEGQE?t=62

I think this explains well my feelings on the show.  The show is a cheap thrill, a wild misunderstanding that what people love about the story is the shocking moments.  And these moments have value, sure, but you don't need to look far to see a show or movie with something shocking or grotesque.  That the show has come to be simplified to the point where all that matters are these shocking moments, that events such as Sansa keeping key information which can make or break an entire war her family's life depends upon can be called "little details" in the face of this, only goes to show me how little respect the writers have for their audience, and in turn how little respect the audience has come to have for the show. Where book readers are discussing the curve of a character's nose, or the semantics of another's sentence in determining if someone is alive, show watchers are talking about how cool that last battle was.  Who all participated in it?  Who all lived and died?  Who cares by this point?  It happened, it was fun at the time, but it's not going to stay with anyone because there's no investment without the details, nothing to dig into or discover.  It's just a cheap thrill, and when it's over people will move on as if it never happened.

I feel the first three books are better but the show smartly fixed the major issues with the last two books that George wrote.

The major issues I have with the later seasons is that the dialog they made up for Tyrion just isn't of the quality that George would have done.  But that's on George for taking so long to write book 6.
I have been a show watcher and then a book reader. IMO the show manages a great deal of making the best out of the source material. Specially there is one specific change I like in show more than the books is that how it gives light to many non PoV characters and some minor characters and many other incidents. Like for Robb, Margaery , Tywin Lannister, Oberyn - we see these character in much broader light apart from the PoV of someone. The show kinda fills in the gap where somewhere book doesn't fullfill. The books have the great upper hand on the matter of hidden meanings , character understanding and obviously logic , then foreshadowings - which is not much possible to put up on screen. Yet the show have tried putting their bits here and there always as much possible. Its easy to crib over small details and some plotholes but these guys have a million dollar show on their shoulders with a worldwide audience, with a huge cast and crew , they need to serve according to the audience who watch their content , they are not obligated to give what GRRM does. His books are there for that. In spite of the flak they get. They do a great job in bringing out such a complex storyline which have multiple plots and leads. 
To be honest if the GoT was following GRRM's books to heart. I thought it'd be boring since I already read them a few times, and didn't want to go through that again on my TV. I thought DD did a great job of the GoT show except for the Dorne part which I considered butchering, and wasteful of time so far. 

Sweet Jesus if we'd get to watch A Dance with Dragons for 3-5 seasons alone! 
I love both, the show introduced me to the books. My criticism of the show comes down to being disappointed of no Lady Stoneheart and Daario's beard. My criticism of the books are sometimes GRRM wanders off into describing nothing a bit too much
Dan and Dave are amazing at special effects.

But their storytelling and scripting skills are laughable...

Haha this comes down to all ASOIAF fans being too butthurt to enjoy the show. I started watching the show and LOVED it. Now that i have been "Enlightened" I can not stand some changes the show has made. It is a fantastic show if you don't compare it to the book series it's based upon that is 100 times better. 
You cut off the earlier part of who Robb was answering "I do." The answer is  Ser Stevron Frey. Here is the entire passage from Catelyn IX:

>As the northern lords studied the castle, a sally port opened, a plank bridge slid across the moat, and a dozen knights rode forth to confront them, led by four of Lord Walder's many sons. Their banner bore twin towers, dark blue on a field of pale silver-grey. Ser Stevron Frey, Lord Walder's heir, spoke for them. The Freys all looked like weasels; Ser Stevron, past sixty with grandchildren of his own, looked like an especially old and tired weasel, yet he was polite enough. "My lord father has sent me to greet you, and inquire as to who leads this mighty host."

>"I do." Robb spurred his horse forward. He was in his armor, with the direwolf shield of Winterfell strapped to his saddle and Grey Wind padding by his side.

>The old knight looked at her son with a faint flicker of amusement in his watery grey eyes, though his gelding whickered uneasily and sidled away from the direwolf. "
See Stevron Frey is the Old Knight, the referenced son is Robb Stark and it says "her" because the PoV is from Catelyn, so from her PoV the Old Knight is looking at her son. 
How are we supposed to know who it is when you don't include the context? "The old knight" is whomever Robb is replying to when he says "I do."

I don't know who the old knight is, I assume someone mentioned earlier, but the POVs is Catelyn. So everything is told referring to her. And Catelyn's son is Robb. 
Brienne, who is, of course, the most unrealistically OP character in GOT. (perhaps not so in the books, just the TV show)

Come one, she's really going to *overpower* the hound? psh. Maybe *outskill* him, but not *overpower* him. 

But whatevs.

Brienne.
I'd pick Jon just because Kit Harington's swordfights look the best. Guy looks like he puts in a lot of training and practice. 
I think it depends.. (situation) if you watch Brienne threatening to kill Sansa / Arya - etc. Jon would win. 
Brienne is a fighter and Jon is a warrior. I'll take the warrior every time.
Brienne. She's more experienced than Jon at sword fighting.
Brienne
Brienne's sword couldn't penetrate that plot armor.


I mean it depends - I think if it was a fight to the death Jon would bring his game up but if it was just a casual game/tournament I think Brienne would win.
S6 Jon beats brienne, but season 1-5 jon loses.

But after S6 jon is op. He has killed walkers, wildlings, brothres, boltons and a fucking cavalry charge and killed like 20+ people at the BOB
Brienne would be my bet. She and Jon are both excellent swordsmen/women and both wield valyrian steel,
but Brienne is stronger and perhaps a bit more experienced (although Jon has certainly fought a lot of battles at this point). Jon might be faster and his blade is slightly longer, so if he can keep her at bay until he lands the first cut, he might swing it in his favor, but my bet is on Brienne.
Jon in the show, Brienne in the books. 
Jon Snow
Jon snow period, he has killed white walkers, wildlings. Did u see him kill like 100 people in the battle vs ramsay?!
Jon for sure.

Brienne most definitely. I mean, Jon Snow is the most important character and all, but when you mention the top sword fighters, it's Jaime Lannister, Barriston Selmy, etc. And since Brienne beat Jaime Lannister in a fight, she'd def beat Jon Snow.
In the show there is really not much to say that jon is a remarkable fighter by lord standards.  

like in BotB he kills a lot of soldiers but its in the fog of war, he might have had a god watching him, and he will have received much more training then the average soldier, being trained to fight from a very young age. so its impressive but not amazing.

at castle black he is a good fighter but everyone else there is shit, they were all poor criminals most of whom had never held a blade in their life. so really most of his time there doesn't show much.

jon did kill a white walker, but at the same time so did sam, possibly the worst fighter we have seen in the show.  also in the fight jon was down, he was defeated the white walker had won and was delivering his finishing blow, the WW expected jons blade to shatter but it didn't that caught him off guard this confusion is how jon won.  if the WW knew from the beginning that the sword would not break the ending of the battle would probably be a lot different.

he does kill a thenn which ill admit is nice but doesn't really stack up against what brienne has done.

she beats loras, the hound and jamie at different times.

i can't really remember jon ever going up against another lord (other than ramsay and he was more of an archer and not really great at duels) or anyone as highly regarded as loras, the hound, or jamie.  

brienne wins every time
Brienne, if you ask me. She has more power, a longer reach, and more experience. Jon does seem to have some sort of outside force helping him though (especially in the Battle of the Bastards) and that alone might mean he would win, but if it was strictly based on their skills and experiences, I think Brienne is possibly the best warrior in the entire story. The Mountain would give her a run for her money, or perhaps if Jaime still had both hands..but other than that, I don't even think Bronn could take her, and I'd bet that even he could beat Jon
Brienne would destroy him, easily.
The self-righteous Mary Sue would probably win. But I'd definitely back Jon for his wildcard tenacity 
Jon killing the white walker was pure luck, if he had a regular sword he would've been slaughtered, he was overpowered and got lucky. 

Brienne may not win in an "honorable" duel against Jon but seeing her fight against the hound she couldn't give less of a shit about honor in combat (she may be honorable but not in a fight). She'll play dirty and win. 

Brienne hands down. 
Brienne would win using one hand.....

God people think Jon is good, he isn't that special...... He only wins his fights cuz he is a main character. 

Also the only reason he killed that WW  was because it was surprised/stunned that Jon's sword didn't shatter and in its confusion, Jon did the same swing 4 years olds do when they get their first lightsabre.
Very popular theory states that he is a secret Targ (Blackfyre) and is trying to put his family back on the throne
Well i think Varys is a sea monster! 
Book Varys is definitely a Blackfyre supporter (he's trying to put someone else on the throne that the books strongly hint is not the Targaryen he says he is). House Blackfyre fought a generations long war against House Targaryen and Ser Barristan Selmy eventually ended the male Blackfyre line. A related theory suggests that Varys himself is a Blackfyre and his motivation is to finally put a Blackfyre on the throne now that House Targaryen is gone (though Daenerys is prophesied to "dance" with this dragon in a bloody civil war).
I have a theory (very tinfoily) that he and Littlefinger are working together for an endgame that benefits them both, in both the show and books. It's very complicated to explain but it does actually fit without much wiggle room considering everything we know about both characters.
Alt Shift X has you covered, as always

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M_hhVg9XUE
So, uh, and what about Kinvara? She shows up in 1 scene and she's forgotten?
Not sure how much it could really mean but I remember the suggestive look towards the throne that Varys gives Oberyn when he asks him what he really wants

He has always been very pro-Targ, you could see that in S1 IMO.
In the show, sure, to some extent, though we know he is in favor of Daenerys. He also says in an earlier episode when Ned asks him who he serves, he says "The realm. Someone must." He's in favor of whoever would be the best ruler.

There are lots of pretty solid theories for the books, though. He is a Blackfyre who wants to put Aegon on the throne. Aegon is actually a Blackfyre, due to being Illyrio's son. Illyrio married a Blackfyre. And it has been theorized that she was Varys' sister.
Half Westworld.
The original Westworld movie was a park divided into three periods, including Medieval World.

Don't bother Jaqen H'gar. This is his fucking vacation.
Probably in reference to [GRRM's interview where he jokingly stated he'd love to see a Westworld/GoT crossover](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/10/westworld-game-of-thrones-crossover-george-rr-martin).


Only if you find promotion of two shows in one ad interesting.
No, but that is a dope picture.
Translation: "we see on CCXP", comic con experience.
What if Jon Snow is just a host and that's the real reason he came back from the dead?

GOT and Westworld Crossover? Say it isn't so.....(fingers crossed)
A certain crossover that is in the air??
Martin has said the Dothraki are loosely based on the Mongols and Huns, with cultural habits borrowed from other horse warrior cultures like the Comanche. They don't wear or understand much about armor (!), so their military tactics are a bit different from the Mongols, but their numbers are similar. Mongols would ride to war in vast units called the touman, which included roughly 10,000 riders plus servants, slaves, baggage trian, etc. That means Dothraki too must have some large-scale command and control like the Mongols had.

Mongols have a funny reputation in Europe, a reputation essentially based on medieval propaganda. I say "Mongol," you say "horde." You picture a band of wild savages roving the land murdering and devouring everything in their path like locusts. 

But in fact, Mongols were among the finest military strategists and tacticians of their era, or any era. They were masters of cavalry tactics, and were able to coordinate thousands of riders broken into ad hoc fighting groups in the midst of battle. This meant that their generals could adapt strategies on the fly to take advantage of situations on the ground. Read about Genghis Khan's general and master strategist [Subutai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subutai).  

> He directed more than twenty campaigns in which he conquered thirty-two nations and won sixty-five pitched battles, during which he conquered or overran more territory than any other commander in history. He gained victory by means of imaginative and sophisticated strategies and routinely coordinated movements of armies that were hundreds of kilometers away from each other. He is also remembered for devising the campaign that destroyed the armies of Hungary and Poland within two days of each other, by forces over five hundred kilometers apart.  

> Having devastated the various Russian principalities, he sent spies as far as Poland, Hungary, and Austria in preparation for an attack into the heartland of Europe. Having a clear picture of the European kingdoms, he brilliantly prepared an attack nominally commanded by Batu Khan and two other princes of the blood. While Batu Khan, son of Jochi, was the overall leader, Subutai was the actual commander in the field, and as such was present in both the northern and southern campaigns against Kievan Rus'. He also commanded the central column that moved against the Kingdom of Hungary. While Kadan's northern force won the Battle of Legnica and Güyük's army triumphed in Transylvania, Subutai was waiting for them on the Hungarian plain.

> King Béla IV of Hungary had summoned a council of war at Esztergom, a large and important settlement upriver from Buda and Pest. As Batu was advancing on Hungary from the northeast, the Hungarian leadership decided to concentrate their strength at Pest and then head north to confront the Mongol army. When news of the Hungarian battle strategy reached the Mongol commanders, they slowly withdrew to the Sajo River, drawing their enemies on. This was a classic Mongol strategy, ultimately perfected by Subutai. He prepared a battlefield suitable to his tactics, and waited for his enemies to blunder in. It was a strong position, because woods prevented their ranks from being clearly scouted or seen, while across the river on the plain of Mohi, the Hungarian army was widely exposed.

> Only one day after the smaller Mongol army in Poland had won the Battle of Legnica, Subutai launched his attack, thus beginning the Battle of Mohi during the night of April 10, 1241. At Mohi, a single division crossed the river in secret to advance on the Hungarian camp from the southern flank. The main body began to cross the Sajo by the bridge at Mohi, and continued to attack the following day. This was met with fierce resistance, so catapults were used to clear the opposite bank of crossbowmen, as was noted earlier. When the crossing was completed, the second contingent attacked from the south.

> The result was complete panic, and, to ensure that the Hungarians did not fight to the last man, the Mongols left an obvious gap in their encirclement. This was one of Subutai's classic tricks, to create a tactical situation which appeared to be favourable to the enemy, but which was anything but. The Mongols had already incurred heavier than usual casualties as the Hungarian crossbowmen had done considerable damage to the Mongol cavalry. Subutai did not want a battle where the massed crossbowmen, supported by mounted knights, stood firm and fought to the death against his army. He far preferred to let them flee and be slaughtered individually. The gap in the Mongol lines was an invitation to retreat, which would leave the knights and crossbowmen spread out all over the countryside, easy pickings for the disciplined Mongols. As Subutai had planned, the Hungarians poured through this apparent hole in the Mongol lines, which led to a swampy area, poor footing for horses and hard going for infantry. When the Hungarian knights split up, the Mongol archers picked them off at will. It was later noted that corpses littered the countryside over the space of a two-day journey. Two archbishops and three bishops were killed at the Sajo, plus 40,000 fighting men. At one stroke, the bulk of Hungarian fighting men were totally destroyed, with relatively minimal casualties to the Mongols, reportedly less than 1,000 men. 

Note the extensive use of spies, scouts and advance communication. Subutai was fighting in unfamiliar territory, yet he knew the terrain, the political divisions, the strength and locations and fighting ability and psychological state of his enemy commanders as well as enemy soldiers. And he took steps to conceal that same information about his own forces. This wasn't a ravening horde of corpse-raping savages. This was Europe being invaded by an enemy that was *more* sophisticated in just about every way, except for the part about being bent on murder, conquest and enslavement.

Nor were Mongols limited to fighting in open fields. They also became adept at city breaking in their long sweep across the steppe. They brought Chinese and Persian engineers with them to breach walls and overcome defenses. They also understood diplomacy and governance, learned early on as Genghis unified the various Mongol clans. For over a century there were Mongol rulers of China, India, Persia, Turkey, Russia, etc.

Individual Mongol warriors began learning to ride and shoot from horseback from the age of 5. They used composite shortbows with a draw weight of roughly 160 lb. (modern day professional archers rarely use anything greater than 100 lb.). The powerful bows gave them tremendous range, accuracy and quickness. Point being, they had a high level of skill and combat discipline to carry out complex strategies. It wasn't until WWII that western armies came around to fully understanding the Mongols' strategic use of highly mobile, coordinated firepower.

The Westerosi knights aren't nearly as naive as 13th century medieval Europeans. They have a more sophisticated grasp of strategy, and disciplined armies to carry out strategy. One thing makes them very similar to Europe in the 13th century though: fragmentation. After years of fighting one another in a multi-sided civil war, Westeros is going to be unable to unify its armies or rally its leadership around a single strategic goal. A skilled Mongol-style leader commanding a single unified army, which Daenarys is learning to become, would be able to exploit those divisions, turn enemies against one another, use one army's mistrust of another to annihilate both, etc. 

One problem: the Dothraki seem to rarely use archers. You almost hardly see them carrying a bow, that I can recall at least. Instead they carry curved scimitars like Ottoman Turks. It makes them the equivalent of "shock" cavalry rather than range cavalry. This is stupid, because it gives away one of the great strategic assets of a cavalry army: highly mobile firepower. Swords are indeed badass. But bows win wars.
It compares to real history, they have been exaggerated by people in Westeros. But still its 40,000 riders and as said their battle tactics are totally unknown and different. But they wont help Dany much in the siege of Kings Landing. With a open field they can just mow down an army, like when the riders of Rohan when they mowed down the orcs at Minas Tirith. 
The main advantage of the Dothraki would be superior mobility. They're *all* cavalry. If they're led by a competent general, they will only ever hit the enemy army's weak spots, including their supplies.

Armor and skill at handling a sword won't help your heavy infantry that much after they haven't eaten anything for a week.
From the first book when Dany asks Jorah about how good the Dothraki are:

“Now,” the knight said, “I am less certain. They are better riders than any knight, utterly fearless, and their bows outrange ours. In the Seven Kingdoms, most archers fight on foot, from behind a shieldwall or a barricade of sharpened stakes. The Dothraki fire from horseback, charging or retreating, it makes no matter, they are full as deadly... and there are so many of them, my lady. Your lord husband alone counts forty thousand mounted warriors in his khalasar.”

“Is that truly so many?”

“Your brother Rhaegar brought as many men to the Trident,” Ser Jorah admitted, “but of that number, no more than a tenth were knights. The rest were archers, freeriders, and foot soldiers armed with spears and pikes. When Rhaegar fell, many threw down their weapons and fled the field. How long do you imagine such a rabble would stand against the charge of forty thousand screamers howling for blood? How well would boiled leather jerkins and mailed shirts protect them when the arrows fall like rain?”

“Not long,” she said, “not well.”

He nodded. “Mind you, Princess, if the lords of the Seven Kingdoms have the wit the gods gave a goose, it will never come to that. The riders have no taste for siegecraft. I doubt they could take even the weakest castle in the Seven Kingdoms, but if Robert Baratheon were fool enough to give them battle...”
Cersei and Robert literally have this conversation in the first season. 
Paraphrasing.
Cersei: They can't be that good. They don't have armour and their weapons aren't as good. If anything we'll hide in the castles.
Robert: And as were hiding in the castles they are raiding, raping, and murdering the people we are supposed to protect. Then they turn on us too....

You get the picture. The Dothraki may not be a good army in the traditional sense, but they have huge numbers and are great at creating havoc. 
I've thought about this question before. IMHO, their combat prowess has been exaggerated. The best thing from the real world I can compare them too are the Numidian cavalry of around 200 B.C. The Numidian were considered the best horseman around, and they operated by lightning attacks with curved blades and fast horses.

In their environment, when there was a large, open field to mount a charge, there was almost no stopping them. They would swoop in, hack the enemy to pieces and then ride off. Their problems came when they had to fight hand to hand for a prolonged period of time. Their light armor and light weaponry weren't suited to close quarters fighting. 

I think the Dothraki are the same, in an open field they can decimate entire armies, but when you get up close to them, their obvious flaws result in what happened to the fool who challenged Jorah.
The reason the hordes were so successful in real life is because the european armies weren't that familiar with their battle tactics, something similar will probably happen here.
Jorah is far from a "weak old man".

He is about 45. He's on the downward slope from his prime, but considering he has been fighting almost non-stop for about 10 years he is probably in incredibly good shape compared to someone like Ned.

Ned hadn't fought in years and was still able to hold off Jaime Lannister until someone intervened.
Sometimes a Chevauchee is just what is needed to draw the enemy out of their castles.  This is where the Dothraki will be important.

A chevauchée (French pronunciation: ​[ʃəvoʃe], "promenade" or "horse charge", depending on context) was a raiding method of medieval warfare for weakening the enemy, primarily by burning and pillaging enemy territory in order to reduce the productivity of a region, as opposed to siege warfare or wars of conquest. The chevauchée could be used as a way of forcing an enemy to fight, or as a means of discrediting the enemy's government and detaching his subjects from their loyalty. This usually caused a massive flight of refugees to fortified towns and castles, which would be untouched by the chevauchée. The use of the chevauchée declined at the end of the 14th century as the focus of warfare turned to sieges.
1. The Dothraki are not based on historical examples. Every nomadic people using horses I can immediately think of used the bow as horse archers. Scythians, Sarmatians, Parthians, Iranians (Sassanid Persians), Turkomen, Tartars, Mongols, Manchus, even the Native American Plains tribes once they adopted the horse, all used the bow in combination with the lance. While the majority were horse archers with little armor, there was always a hard core of heavy, armored cavalry using the spear. Those that did not use the bow used javelins and other missile weapons to hunt and to fight. The sword was used to complete mounted combat, not initiate it. Such horse nomads often exhibited sophisticated organization and tactics, derived from both internal and external examples and experiences. The primary tactics was to surround or maneuver around an enemy shooting their bows at the appropriate ranges until the enemy's formations and moral began to erode and then have the heavy element charge in to break up the enemy and allow the horse archers to close with the sword. Once the enemy was broken, the horse archers would pursue and destroy. These tactics were exhibited at both Carrhae and Liegnitz. A well-disciplined, trained enemy of high morale, however, with an appropriate balanced force of shock and missile troops, cavalry and infantry, could defeat the horse nomads. If their was a vulnerability, it was the need to feed their horses. Grass for grazing was needed. Burning the fields, cutting the grazing areas short, plowing them under, all denied the nomads the ability to feed their horses. A "scorched earth" strategy combined with retiring into fortified cities and defensive positions could force nomadic invaders to withdraw back to their homelands. 

2. The Dothraki exhibit little tactical skill or discipline beyond loyalty and horsemanship. Tactically, against spear armed, disciplined and formed infantry or cavalry like the Unsullied or the Lannister professional troops, they would be useless on the battlefield. Horses are not stupid. They will neither willing collide with each other or run on to pointy things. Against undertrained and underdisciplined feudal levies, they could be devastating. Such infantry would either break and run when the Dothraki charged or they might be enticed into breaking their shield wall in pursuit of a "routing" enemy, like the Anglo-Saxon fyrd at Hastings. Against undisciplined, ie. feudal, light cavalry with similar skills, victory would go to the force with greater morale and numbers. Against undisciplined feudal heavy cavalry, the Dothraki would tempt them into charges and chases, cutting off small parties and overwhelming them until the horses were too tired to trot, much less charge and then close in for the kill. The discipline of the Knights of the Vale would determine whether they win or lose against the Dothraki. The Dothraki would have difficulty with an enemy that used field fortifications which would force them to dismount and fight as individual warriors against defenders fighting as a collective. They would also have a problem with an army using the tactics of the 14th-15th century CE English, where they would be drowned in clouds of arrows before they could even close with an enemy in close formation, armored and using spears and pole-arms. What the Dothraki would be good at is raiding.  Raids into the enemy's rear, disrupting his foragers, his supply trains, his camp followers would deny your opponent food and fodder while forcing you to disperse your mobile forces to protect your supply bases, lines and areas. Raids on villages collecting food and fodder and driving the villagers towards King's Landing to fill it with refugees that drain the city's resources.

3. The Dothraki and their horses are not used to the cold. The weather could have an effect on their mobility and morale. The US Army conducted winter campaigns against the Plains tribes because their smaller ponies couldn't breast the snow drifts and the warriors were huddled in their villages, not riding across the plains and avoiding pursuit. Ice and mud can also slow down horses. 

4. As it is, with the size and number of ships Danerys Stormborn has available, she could have transported no more than 15,000 Dothraki to Westeros. The limiting factor would be transporting the horses. Even into the late 19th century, an army being transported by sea could lose the majority of the horses aboard ships. That is certainly not sufficient numbers if Cersei negotiates a deal with Lord Protector of the Vale, Peter Baelish and he brings her 15,000 Knights (though feudal custom would limit this deployment to no more than 90 days). Logistics would also have limited the size of the Dothraki force Danerys could have brought to Westeros. Winter is here. The fields are harvested, grass and wild grains are hibernating or dying, grazing for the Dothraki horses will be in short supply. The fodder, such as hay, will have been collected and stored. Such feed can be easily destroyed to prevent it from falling into hands of an army and much would be in fortified places. Moreover, grass fed horse do not take well to grain feeds, just as grain fed horses don't do well grazing. The Dothraki could soon find their horses starving. 
4. GRRM is a fantasy writer, not a military historian. You just have to go with the flow. 
Truth be told, 40.000k Dothraki would be helpful where ever she is. Most, if all of the fighting strong will be mounted. Having that number of swords could play a brilliant fake battle to draw soldiers out of possition or with a small force of skilled, disaplined unsullied they would wipe out any force in westeros. They don't have to be amazing, they just have to defeated a number of lannister forces or euron grayjoys army if they are stupid enought to fight on land. Still i would have left them in mareen where they can bend the masters into submission maybe. 
Well, Jorah defeating the bloodrider was more to establish Jorah as a competent fighter.  Plus, a lot of the poor fighting techniques can be blamed on the writers, director, coordinators, etc..  I mean, Selmy was supposed to be one of the greatest swordsman alive and he let himself get surrounded.  I'm not a warrior, but even I know you're not supposed to let yourself get surrounded. 
The Dothraki are pretty much ALL battle hardened and experienced killers, where the average soldier in a Westerosi army is a peasant who had a sword put in his hand for the first time. There are maybe a few thousands actual fighters in Westeros (that's being generous), who are trained and even wear armor, so the Dothraki wouldn't be fighting Jorah's, they would be fighting scared farmers. Plus, the only people who actually wear armor are knights and rich lords, the average soldier wears what Jon has, pretty much nothing. 
They are bloodthirsty warriors who ride and fight their whole life, the average westerosi soldier is a peasant, who is forced to fight for his lord and who has never holden a weapon before. 



You're forgetting about the battle at the Field of Crows. 80,000 Dothraki defeated an army of 200,000 Heavy Cav and Spears using classic Momgol false-retreat tactics. Then they razed the city to the ground. The Battle of Qohor is an example of the incompetence of a single Khal, who simply refused to flank the enemy or use his horse archers.


 You're severely underestimating the Dothraki. The road to Vaes Dothrak is lined with the sacred artifacts of civilizations that they've conquered.

Well I'd say as riders and calvary the dothraki are unequaled but as you said other things come into play terrain, weather, supplies. The reason why the unsullied beat the dothraki like that is because they are highly disciplined, typically when you see a large calvary charging towards you the first instinct ain't to hold the line especially without spears and pikes but I digress if dany is smart and heeds the word of her advisers she could use them in a different manner if she takes the iron fleet and have them blockade the ports while the the tyrell dornish and unsullied forces lay siege by land she can have the dothraki raid the westerlands essentially cutting off all hope of help while starving the city out.
Horses are the MVP of medieval warfare.  The Dothraki have many horses, and many riders.  Numbers and horses are both pretty big; however they are not equipped at all, and they are not martially talented, so it sort of evens out in many situations.  What they can do is run down infantry and not much else.  This is useful, so they are pretty valuable, but they're worth less than dirt dismounted, and they cannot take fortifications.  They will also lose their numbers pretty quick, since major battles will force them to ride against battle lines and spiked trenches

Overall they're kind of like a 6/10, pretty useful, but not really above average.  Definitely worth having for numbers and horses, decent addition to an army




The Dothraki are 'wild savages'. They are bloody thirsty and messy fighters hence they are so feared. Because of their expert use of chavlry and archary on horses, if an westorian army was to charge at them they will fail (Robert said it was foolish to meet the Dothraki in open fields). 
However if they attack and sieged a city it'll be a different story. Put someone like Randyll Tarly, Jon or Robb, Tywin, Stannis in command of a defending army and they will be able to push back an invading Dothraki force. 
They are effective due to their tactics.

They are based on the real-life Mongols to some extent and the Mongols had good battle tactics such as using arrows from horseback, using feints and false retreats to draw armies into chasing them and then attacking them from both sides with pincer movements, etc. Against the Westerosi war strategies at least, on open ground, they would decimate them, just like the real-life Mongols had no problem defeating European armies such as in Georgia and Russia.
First off need to get the numbers right, Dany has something along the lines of 100,000 dothraki. Unless her fleet gets destroyed by some sort of storm. She has massive numbers on anyone in westeros right now.
Rhaegar Jr.
Because technically the show itself hasn't revealed that Rhaegar is the father, just that Lyanna is the mother.  Now, the avid fans know that if one is confirmed the other must be.  Less knowledgeable fans might not know though.  I think that's why they are saving the Rhaegar reveal until next season.  Giving Jon a obviously Targaryen sounding name would have spoiled the mystery early for those fans that hadn't put it together yet. 
It's Aegon. I know people cannot really accept that he's also Aegon Targaryen, but he is. Probably.
It just doesn't seem necessary. We know the child is jon snow. They showed us that it is jon snow, so I'm not sure saying "Jon Snow" is really necessary. They made sure to add "if Robert finds out, he'll kill him" to dispel any notion that this was Robert's kid, but beyond that not much was needed.
My best guess? Jon was probably going to be named Viserys. Rhaegar was naming his kids after Aegon the Conqueror and his Sister Wives. He already had Rhaenys and Aegon. All he needed was to name a kid after Visenya but Elia Martel couldn't have any more kids because she was to frail so he ran off with Lyanna. 


I know there are theories that Jon's true name is  Jaehaerys after on of his ancestors but Rhaegar had plans for the throne and the realm and I highly doubt he would just throw a random name in the mix  like Jaehaerys when he already has Aegon and Rhaenys. 


The name Jon was probably picked by Ned from Jon Arryn. 
I always thought it was something that started with an 'A.' Apparently the actress who played Lyanna said the real name but they muted it in post-production. If you read her lips, to me at least, it's so very clear that she's saying a name that starts with the letter A. I personally think it's either 'Azor' or 'Aegon.'

That link up there is just one theory -- I think she is saying that his name is Howland.  He and Lyanna had much more to their story than we've seen on screen so far.  In fact, my own, personal, overly-complicated theory is that Ned is protecting Howland by keeping the secret.  I think he helped Lyanna escape.  No one buys my theories though, for what they're worth.
Damn you botched the ordering of those photos.
Haha. You don't mess with a man's hair!
I'm having trouble understanding, can you explain?

There may be no lord of light, but people rise from dead.  There are forces at play in this world not seen in ours...
I don't think your theory is off-base. To us, magic is a supernatural power. While it could be that in ASOIAF, it is treated as either an element, and in some cases, a myth, in Westeros and Essos. I think GRRM has something very interesting planned with magic and the practitioners of that art for his story.

However, there are a few things I would disagree with you on.

Kinvara is likely a show creation and could be, as you say, the manipulator of magic, specifically blood magic. It is more likely that it is a different character in the books, since she does not appear as of the preview chapters of TWOW.

I don't think Varys is caught off guard by Kinvara's voice. I think he is caught off guard that she knew his story and that he heard the voice in the flames. That is what is so disturbing to Varys. If it had been her voice that Varys heard, he should have fought against giving her the ability to help them. Also, what visions by Varys led him to rise as high as he has? It's more his ability to master his craft as a thief and observer of the importance of secrets and letters. Varys could also have some blood that has put him on his course in life.

Regardless, good theory. There is definitely someone or something using the flames and magic to their benefit. It could be the high priests/priestesses of R'hllor, the Children of the Forest, the White Walkers, the Three-Eyed Crow/Raven... who knows but it is very exciting prospect!

This, this is a very very solid theory.
What if The Lord of Light is actually one of the Old Gods?   
There is magic in this world. That's why it so messed up. 

Creepy mystery cults dominate Essos, with Asshai being some sort of Vatican for them. Look how dirty and deranged that place is. 

The Lord of Light probably exists a supernatural being with cult built around him. But that doesn't mean there is an afterlife or that he is a god. 
You overthink. People seeing things in the fire are just weak people who see what they want. Do you know how many religious people claim to have seen their god?
Chekhov's gun?
Red herring? 
It's all part of the big picture? 
I feel like you're looking for an amalgamation of Chekhov's Gun and a Red Herring.

Ramsay Bolton says "A Feast For Crows" in the Hardhome episode.  He was talking to his dad at some point in the first half of the episode since the second half is all Jon at Hardhome.  
In a deleted scene, theatre cersei says : "I feel the winds of winter come across the land"
Damphair
Damp-Hair, because of his constantly wet hair
In the audiobooks Roy Doctrice pronounces it "Dam Fair", though he is wrong on some pronunciations.

Most people assume is Damp Hair, because as a Drowned Priest his hair is frequently damp, what with the seaweed in it and all.

Generally when GRRM is asked about pronounciations he says you can read it however you like. He himself pronounces some things odd, like calling Dothraki  "Dathricky".
"Damp Hair" George RR Martin was asked once and that was his pronunciation.
Ask yourself the question, "What the fuck is a dam phair?" There's your answer.
I read it as damp-hair; being sea faring folk and all the other water references
I always thought it was Damp-Hair (he being a Drowned God priest and all), but apparently it's Dam-fare.

The steel set looks great. And is well made. I'd go for it
Damn, I've been buying every season as soon as they're released on Blu-Ray, cuz I'm a huge fan, and want a full set as this is my favorite TV show ever...but I didn't even know there were steel book versions..

I feel like I need them all..
So I take it we're NOT getting sigil covers from Best Buy this year? Too bad, they lost my $39.99 this year because I'm not a steelbook fan.
I like this. That is all. 
Hopefully no one watches this who hasn't seen the series. It seems to cover most of the major spoilers. 
This would be a great way to convince people who haven't seen the show to watch it. The hype is strong in this.

I like it!  Great music selection and the editing is spot on.  I'm going to show it to people that are telling me that they aren't interested.  Well done and thanks!
The show is fantasy. Fantasy doesn't typically have a time period but rather is inspired my the medieval ages. This allows for things like more recent dialogue mixed in with proper outdated lingo. So while GoT uses a mix it can as fantasy has no required time period. So to answer your question Yes. Yes it can.
Why do you think "mum and dad" is recentish?

FOR EVERYONE'S INFORMATION

The concept of an ice dragon is unconfirmed by HBO or GRRM. The initial ice dragon poster, and this one, are both FAN MADE and not official release posters. Please do not confuse this with real promo materials.

Love, 

The Mod Staff Who Continuously Has to Approve This Because It's Not a Spoiler.
Welp, this will obviously show up all over Facebook tomorrow as the next, "leaked poster for season 7."
I want a text less version so bad
Season 8s promo line will be "The End Ends."
Did the guy credit the artist? I've seen this picture before many times, but with slightly different colors. All this guy did was change the color and put "Game of Thrones" over the picture. 
Ah, so you're telling me that a "great fan made poster" is just photoshopping blue flames and the GoT logo onto a truly awesome picture, [with no credit to the actual artist?](https://cdn3.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/001/945/719/large/grzegorz-rutkowski-dragons-breath-1920-2.jpg?1454970674).  C'mon people!
I don't know who made this fan poster, but I figure the original artist deserves some credit.

Source is ["Dragon's Breath" by Grzegorz Rutkowski](https://cdn3.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/001/945/719/large/grzegorz-rutkowski-dragons-breath-1920-2.jpg?1454970674) (still the top post all-time on /r/imaginaryDragons)
I still don't really get the ice dragon foreshadowing. 

>He once wrote a book about ice dragons, ice dragons confirmed.

Steven King also wrote a book about a killer clown, doesn't mean it will/has to show up in the time eating monster book. 

>The crypts are scary and there's probably a dragon down there.

Or maybe Cthulhu, or actual ghosts. Is there anything that actually points to an ice dragon, or a even dragon for that matter? Without a doubt there's some metaphorical shit for ice down there, being Winterfell and all. 

For the record, I haven't read the books so wtf do I know what I'm talking about. And if an ice dragon shows up, I'll be the first to lose my shit in excitement. It just doesn't seem likely, considering all the foreshadowing on other mega events. 
All I see is Link on a horse with Navi right above him. Badass poster! 
Ice Dragon get hype
Does anyone think that we actually will see an ice dragon? Is there any implication for it? Part of me thinks it would be super cool, but the other part of me thinks it could be a bit much. Regardless, I better see a white walker ride a giant spider or there's gonna be hell to pay. 
Anyone have a link to just the pictures without all the flair, this would make a great wallpaper for my phone.
That is a very sexy poster. 
I would so welcome an animated version of the series, as long as it kept its framing and styling majestic and realistic like this and not cartoony.

artist name plz?
"The end begins" is such a cheesy cheap slogan, id rather have something like "winter is here"
So these are all fake, right?  I've seen a few Night King on Ice Dragon posters already
Deathwing.
> ~~The end begins~~

Now it begins.

Nah, now it ends.
I want this hanging in my living room
Very cool:)
If they have a frost dragon hiding somewhere beyond the Wall I am going to lose my shit.
Who is the dragon tho? And the person its roasting?
I would love to see a Photoshop thread that's just what people imagine a pivotal scene in Season 7 will be. Stuff like this or the Ice Dragon photoshop that popped up a few days ago. Would love to see what people can come up with!

(Gold for whoever makes the epic Cleganebowl season 7 poster)
Oh.
Damn that's really good!  Nice. 
This literally brought chills down my spine. 
Whoa what ENB is that
"Winter has come" or "Fire is coming" or "All debts will be paid" or something might have been better ... 
Drogon used DragonBreath! TheSevenKingdoms is now paralyzed!
Is this a sequel to the film Frozen and How to train your dragon?
So hollywwood campy like and ungrrm like
I want this as the poster for season 7
Remove The "The End Begins" and its perfect.
Jaimie is smoking hot in this fan art.
Scrolling past this on my phone I thought it was something about The Elder Scrolls VI. Was slightly disappointed :/
This is cool but check out the rumored cover for the Winds of Winter book. Hint: It has the iron throne on it and is very wintery. I would rather they use that.
Holy lord of light, that's fantastic! 
That is a badass fucking poster
wwwoooowwwwwww

"Rhaegal, Rhaegal, burning bright / In the forests of the night, / What immortal hand or eye / Could frame thy fearful symmetry?"
Spoiler, Jon Snow gets a Dragon (either Viserion or Rhaegal) and fights Daenerys and Drogon. You saw it here first.
And now it begins!
Aw cool, there's going to be a Yu Gi Oh crossover?
Fuck that's great 
Are there any anti-Dragon strategies in Westeros?
I have to say.. it is a beautiful poster...
We really did Daenerys in Westeros. 
Neltharion!
Looks like Deathwing.
Love it. 

I have 2 questions though. 

1. Why is the fire blue?

2. Where can I buy a print?
Is that Jon Snow in front of the fire?
WHY CARE ABOUT SEASON 7 WHEN ITS GAME 7

THE CUBS HAVE WON THE WORLD SERIES
This is beautiful man. I fuckin love it!
In another realworld comparison, up until the 19th Century it was actually safer to drink wines and other alcohols than it was to drink water, due to any number of different types of pollutants in the water. Assuming Westeros is like this, I doubt the strength of the alcohol is as high as their modern, real-world alternatives.

I'd be surprised if Dornish Wine - one of the strongest IU - is any stronger than 6%-8%.

EDIT: Word.
I would imagine that the majority of brews are much less potent than those available today. Much like the middle ages there would be a  scarcity of reliable clean drinking water hence the over zealous consumption of ales//wines. Naturally the party juice would have kick to it!
Technically the strength of an alcoholic drink is influenced first by what kind of yeast it is fermented with and its sugar content. The yeast digests sugar, makes ethanol from it, but ethanol is toxic to the yeast itself, so if it reaches a certain level, the yeast themselves will die. If the sugar runs out, the yeast will have nothing to ferment to ethanol.

So, nowadays beers are fermented to 2-6% ethanol, wines reach 8-15%. Nowadays with GM-yeast you can go up to 20% ethanol content. So wines in Westeros can be any strength from 8%-20%. These stay fresh in a hermetically sealed casket for years, they are a good source of vitamins and nutrients in winters. Most likely on Westeros people avoid scurvy during winters by drinking wine. Theoretically you can imagine yeast strains which endure more ethanol, you can make strogner wines that way. Sugar content of grape juice can be increased by using dried grapes, so sugar is not a limiting factor in fermentation if you take your time to produce stronger wine. 

On Earth if you want to increase the shelf life of wine, which would be a smart choice when you have winters that last for years, you can distill wine to brandy, or any fermented fruit juice to pálinka and add this to your wine, effectively increasing its ethanol content indefinitely, while keeping most of the vitamins and other nutrients needed during winter. These fortified wines would be valuable for any noble house to survive until spring, they can be of any strength, theoretically they can be made to contain 50% of ethanol, but that would be totally unnecessary for increasing shelf-life. This method is independent of sugar content, you can take a lot of pretty weak wine, distill them to brandy, and increase the ethanol content of weak wine to any level you desire. I would wager that armies take this kind of port wine with them on campaigns, as it can be kept without spoiling during pretty adverse conditions.

"What would the average strength of wine be on Westeros?"

Most likely northern wines are weak, containing 8-9% of ethanol, and they get stronger as you go south. At King's landing you can make nice 14% wines, in Dorne, grape juice contains enough sugar to make <18% wines. If the good winemakers of Westeros know of these  tricks to increase sugar content, they can make wines up to 20%. If they use distilled brandy to increase ethanol content they can make virtually any kind of wine. 

"A LOT of alcohol is consumed by the lords, ladies, and even some commoners."

Historically wine was consumed in various forms, in antiquity the Greeks thought that undiluted wine is toxic, they drank it mixed with water. I have not found any mention of this practice in Westeros, but even if they drink undiluted wine it should contain at least 7-8% of ethanol.

"I'm not sure if the day and age in GoT is related to the Middle Ages in reality, but just how drunk are these people??"

Entirely depends on how strong their wine is, and how much alcohol they can tolerate. 
Distilling alcoholic beverages came after the feudal age of Europe. During this period, the strongest drink you could find was "winter wine". The wine was allowed to settle, placed in a open barrel outside in the cold and the ice that formed on the surface removed, increasing the alcohol content. But this would still not exceed 50 proof or so. For the most part, you're limited to fermentations of various plants and foods, such as wheat, grapes, honey and mare's milk for example. 
As an aside, Germans used to give their kids beer instead of water, even washing their hair in beer, because of the established tradition of substituting alcoholic beverages for water. 
It depends.

Dornish Wine is mentioned to be particularly strong, so probably about 12%.

Whereas Arbor Gold is described as being sweet and lighter, probably around 9%.

Beers and ales will range largely because there probably aren't mass breweries.

Spirits are probably in the 30-40% range.

This would be a good question for AskHistorians.
Minor thing, for general interest: if you want to learn about the actual history of alcohol over the world, I would recommend "the history of the world in six glasses".  It's fairly short, and a great read.
Mildly drunk. They drank a lot of alcohol in the Middle Ages because regular water could have parasites or bacteria that would make you sick.

However they would usually water down the wine quite a bit, the alcohol would make the water mixed with it disinfected.
>The route would be much shorter than the traditional

No it wouldn't [Asshai is south of Slaver's Bay](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/thumb/1/10/WorldofIceandFire.png/400px-WorldofIceandFire.png) so it's also south of Dorne. Going east may be quicker but going all the way north then back south wouldn't be. 


I'd guess ship became crew less for whatever reason and was just floating around in the sunset sea until a current took it to the frozen shore.
It might have traded at Lannisport, Oldtown or Arbor and was carried nort by a storm.

Bran knows the story of Ned coming home from the war with Baby Jon, he knows that Lyanna was "kidnapped" by Rhaegar and saw the tower defended by Kingsguard. It doesn't take a super detective to put it together. He would look really dumb if he didn't.
* 1 - "My aunt Lyanna gave birth to a son."
* 2 - "My father came back from the war with a child"
* 3 - "But where is my father nephew?"
* 4 - ???????
* 5 - "Oh..."

Not a hard guess, even if it was not true.
My best guess would be that Bran is able to put two and two together in regards to Jon's identity and paternal parentage. He may have been able to realize that this baby was the one his father brought home because who else would he leave the baby with, especially when Lyanna asked Ned to protect him? If Bran continues to believe that Jon is Ned's bastard, then the question becomes, "Where and who did my father leave his nephew with? Why didn't he bring him home?" and a million other thoughts of the sort and no answer would really add up with Ned Stark's honor bound character.

In regards to the father, he probably heard the name that we didn't, understood that it was a Targaryen name and connected that with the Targaryen prince that everybody knew Lyanna was "kidnapped" by. 

Might be a bit of a stretch for a young guy such as Bran, but I totally see it being plausible.

Edit: Knew not Know
I think Bran is cleverer than you give him credit. He may not have figured it out immediately, but he will have time to think about it. I am certain he will know it was Jon, and the Rhaegar is probably the father. What he will not know is what we don't know either, and that's if Rhaegar and Lyanna were married, making Jon a legitimate Targaryen, and not just a bastard from a different father.
Bran knew that Lyanna was 'kidnapped' by Rhaegar.
Bran watched Ned go to the Tower of Joy and find Lyanna who had just given birth.
She made Ned promise to protect the baby.
Ned came back from Robert's Rebellion with baby Jon.
It is quite obvious I think. I'm sure Bran could piece it all together.
If nothing else, the tale of Ned finding Lyanna at the Tower of Joy and defeating Ser Arthur Dayne is known. I think it's pretty easy, especially for an educated little lord, to figure out the context of that vision and see that Lyanna's child is Rhaegar's and that he's Jon Snow.
Well, he could take the context clues of 1) Kingsguard defending a tower that seemingly has no royal family members in it (except Jon, in this case), 2) Bran may have heard Lyanna say Robert can never find out (I may be wrong in recalling her saying specifically Robert's name, however), and 3) Bran knows this was the last stop for Ned before returning to Winterfell, and he had Jon when he returned home. But other than that, if Bran wasn't thinking much of those points while watching, there is no confirmed way for him to know that Jon is that baby, even though we know
You really think that was useless? Then i would recommend you to watch the scene again. Ned asked Arthur about why they weren't protecting Rhaeger. 

They said Rhaeger wanted them there. It is known that Ned brings a baby right after the war. His sister gives birth and dies. Being Ned he just wasn't gonna leave the baby there. How much more proof is needed that it was Jon?

Bran is the three eyed raven. The third eye can see what two cannot. I've always thought that Bran's visions were sort of a like a dream how you just know things without explicit explanation. I think he knew that was Jon even though it was left unsaid to him.
I just wish we saw more of Bran's reaction to the realization. He didn't mention it to Meera or Benjen. Would have been nice to get everyone's take on it. I guess we'll have to wait for next season.
I think there is more green seeing to do. I think he will see more so you straight up get a visual answer to everything before they firm state that Jon I'd Raegar's son. 
You're forgetting that it's pretty common knowledge that Lyanna was "kidnapped and raped" by Rhaegar. The only detail Bran wouldn't know is whether Lyanna was willing or not.
When I first saw this scene I was only half watching whilst I was working and I initially thought that Jon was Robert Baratheon's child. That doesn't make any sense though, especially on why Ned had to keep his identity a secret unless by that point Lyanna had a dislike for Robert.
I mean, nothing on screen showed us one way or the other.  We'll have to wait to hear Bran talking about it, I guess.
Doesn't the scene transition sort of imply that Bran saw the whole King in the North scene?
This is so good ! I wish this could have had been my costume 😭 Eurgh sadness

Awesome mask and costume over all! You don't happen to have the files for it laying around still do you? 

Because, you see... I have a - uh - friend who'd love to print it for myself. I mean himself.
Brilliant!
Woah, you 3D printed that whole costume?

I think she'll run into Arya again; which may go differently this time now that Arya has some faceless abilities
I don't think Jon gives a rat's ass about the lord of light prophecy.  I think he couldn't execute a woman who had brought him back to life.

But the idea of the Red Woman v Three Eyed Raven is curious...

There's a part in the first book where Bran muses to himself about all the Brandon Starks through history being the same person.

Bran is a time-warger (he warged into Hodor at the same time he travelled to the past, creating Hodor as we knew him), could he have interacted with Melisandre through the ages as different versions of Bran going back to Bran the builder and Ned's older brother (there are tons more in the books too)?

Could Melisandre mistakenly believe that Bran is the lord of light ?

She said she foresaw a victory at blackwater right? Just like she foresaw the victory at winterfell. Maybe she will be apart of another major battle at blackwater.
I think she'll run into Beric as he heads up North
She told Arya they would cross paths again
Mel is going to join Dany.  The narrative threads are there--she worships fire, Dany has dragons and represents fire, the Red Priests are already proselytizing to Dany's subjects as advocates, and their leader knows shit she shouldn't. 

Kinvara is obviously either REDICULOUSLY well connected, or REDICULOUSLY powerful as a sorceress, or both.  It is entirely plausible that, just as Mel uses illusion and parlor tricks to move the leity into worship, Kinvara may be using tricks to move other red priests.  

Remember that Mel actually does see things in the flames, but more importantly, others see it too.  Either Mel has actual prophetic powers (unlikely given what she has gotten wrong) OR the fires are being used to show her things she needs to see to get things done.

After she resurrects Jon, she knows she has power, and it helps her through her crisis of faith.  She reasons that the Lord of Light must be showing her what she needs to see, but what if it isn't the Lord of Light, but Kinvara or a similarly powerful Red Priest? 

What if Mel is dancing on Kinvara's strings the same way most men dance on Mel's?
I read the books as well and I'm left with the feeling that the Red God and his prophecy are very real. Meaning Jon is his champion and all hell is about to break loose. So yeah, Melisandre I coming back, she needs to, because Jon is her champion.
I thought at some point they reference her as being at least 100 years old, maybe 150 years or so.   I can see Arya killing her eventually but also having some serious back and forth between bran the 3 eyed raven.  Either way I don't she will live through the rest of the series!
It would be cool to see Bran travel into the past and just see Mel chillin
The Red God religion always seems to work in the favor of the White Walkers.

In the Books Varys is actually not a Dany supporter. Varys is an Aegon supporter. I genuinely believe they hadn't planned on not including Aegon until season 3 or 4 when they decided they couldn't add new characters. Also Jorah is an agent of Illyrio who is working with Varys. Varys likely sent word to Illyrio in the show who then warned Jorah. Yes it doesn't seem to make sense without these additional characters because it legitimately doesn't. 
At the time the assassin was sent, Dany wasn't special. Viserys was the legal king and there were no dragons. Dany's assassination would've finally spurred Drogo to help Viserys invade.
Well the original plan is for Aegon to bring the golden company with him,viserys to bring the dothraki which he got my selling dany off.And for Viserys to marry Arriane Martell from dorne and get the dornish allegiance with Aegon to marry whoever was available.

He also warns jorah to expect an attempt,so i think he orders it to save his own skin while making sure none of the attempts will be successful.With there plan adapting the circumstances.

Such as Viserys dieing and dany getting 3 dragons and no husband.Aegon plans to go to meeren and marry dany in the books only for tyrion to manipulate him and get him to go west and attack westeros.

They have no army. However they fund the enemies of the person who holds the debt. It isn't a death sentence for the debt holder but it's a huge disadvantage. 
They topple governments by funding there enemies,Which allows them to hire mercenary companies.I suspect they have toppled quite a few cities in the east 
I'd like to posit a different opinion to the others;
The Faceless Men.
Unstoppable assassins, too expensive to be hired by kings or merchants?
Probably a pittance to the richest single entity in Planetos.
It's a threat that seems credible. Doubtful anyone will build on that in the show or books.The best the Iron Bank could do is start paying for mercs, lead by Targs probably, to invade Westeros. Dany has already done that in the show and winter is come so either way, they won't collect by the end of the series
They have the army of your opponents. After Cersei stops paying the crowns debts in the books, the Iron Bank fully funds Stannis.
They've got options. They can choose to instead fund their enemies, as others have pointed out.

On the other hand, they could threaten to call in the debt publicly. It's really only known to the Small Council that the Crown is broke and very few Lannisters know that they're out of fresh gold to help shore up the difference. If the Iron Bank were to make people lose faith in the nation's currency, there'd be an economic collapse. It shows a lack of faith in the Crown to be able to pay the debt. Inflation would bankrupt anyone who didn't have the actual commodities to back up their wealth, but it would hurt them badly. Granted, the poorest of the people wouldn't be affected much at first (mainly because they already barter (sometimes with sex) and mainly use copper pieces). That is until the struggling merchants who supply food, tools, clothing, and so on suddenly start charging obscene amounts or insisting on barter for valuables (or not showing up at all if there's danger or no profit to be had). 

At a minimum, there'd be famine as food goes unsold and spoils. Possibly a mass migration to Bravos. Armies would disintegrate when soldiers go unpaid (or unfed). 

Of course, the Iron Bank doesn't really want to do that because it would affect them in Bravos, too, but it's something to hold over someone's head if need be.

It's funny, because the USA is *trillions* in debt and we all kinda know that if we all tried to go to the bank and withdraw what we own in cash, they'd only be able to hand out so much before running out. If China ever called in USA's debts, we'd see a similar collapse here.

This is incredible. I got chills. Thanks for sharing.
Some tributes are nice . Others are complete garbage . This is a good one tho .
Answering that would spoil a good chunk of season 3 for you. Want the answer?
[removed]
The men who betrayed him made a pact with the besiegers ... most of the inhabitants had already left by that point, those that hadn't probably quickly did thereafter.

Once the occupying force was gone, no need to stick around 'sieging', instead they run off to slaughter all of the Ironborn they can find (almost certainly including those who just "escaped").
Ramsay was blowing the horn.
not sure if this counts as a [spoiler, but...](/s "The besiegers are Ramsay Bolton's men. Theon's men make a deal for their own lives if they give him Theon..")

Worse procrastinator than me. 
This is why the fucking Winds of Winter hasn't come out yet. I wouldn't be as mad as I am if he released the history because I am a SLUT for ASOIAF history.
I have a theory (that many others share) that he has either finished WoW or in the final stages of finishing but won't release until GoT is finished. I'm guessing he and D&D worked something out because if GRRM releases WoW (which is probably the most anticipated book in the entire world right now) before GoT ends, it will distract fans away from the show and if the book storylines are way better than what the show did in Seasons 5 & 6, the anticipated viewership from HBO's standpoint for Seasons 7 & 8 won't be *nearly* as high as they are now. 
We'll never see it, I am even doubting if the GOT book series will see a conclusion at this point

Is this a new interview? Could he be talking about World of Ice and Fire?
They will probably just be novellas, but I'm interested either way.
I can't possibly wrap my head around the idea of Arya dying. I know GoT is pretty cut throat with killing off beloved characters but I would just be so surprised if she was killed, especially now that the show is not following the books (not that I think GRRM would kill off Arya from the book, cos wifey you know?) 
>The off season is dark and full of costumes
I've read somewhere on here that GRRM originally intended for Jon and Arya to become love interests, so her being the representation of Azor Ahai's wife really works. Hopefully they don't actually end up together in some crazy twist; I think it still really works with how much Jon loves her as a sister.
Okay on the subreddit /r/asoiaf I one of the many people in strong opposition to prophecy holding any power. I like many other believe Prophecy in Game of Thrones is bullshit and more than likely is someone like Bloodraven or Marwyn sending the visions in dreams. These are misinterpreted. No one is Azor Ahai. If the humans do not come together to fight the threat of the Others they're all going to die. 
An adult murdering a child by decapitation on tv is a bit too much even for HBO. Also in the original outline Arya survives the series along with Bran, Jon, Dany and Tyrion... not that they can't die. 
Pretty sure GRRM's wife will divorce him is Arya dies.
I like it. I was thinking about how Longclaw would become Lightbringer as well but hadn't consider Arya. Arya is definitely on her way north if she knows Melisandre is there to scratch her off her list. Jon, just being saved from death by the red woman, might step in to defend against an assassin and there you have your plausible conflict. 

Some solid arguments exist that Longclaw is the original long lost Lightbringer and it just needs to be ignited. I was thinking along the same lines as you, but with Sansa as the sacrificial blood. They are already side by side, and we know conflict is coming in that relationship. We also know that Jon is a stone cold killer when he has to be (Qhorin, Mance, Olly etc) and if his dear sister was perhaps gravely injured and at risk of becoming a wight you know he would kill her. Classic zombie protagonist trope as well, being forced to kill a loved one before they turn. Voile, Lightbringer.
 


Looks like a really interesting theory! Good thought process!

I prefer the theory that Rhaegar was Azor Ahai and Jon Snow is, himself, Lightbringer.

https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/578rbk/spoilers_published_put_the_tinfoil_hat_onazor/
I think after the series ends this debate will still go on. Because more than one character will play a significant role at great cost to themselves, and the details such as lightbringer and sacrifice will be interpreted differently. Some will say Dany because she did X while some will say Jon because he did Y, others may have other characters they can reasonably argue to be Azor Ahai. Prophecy isn't clear cut.
"Lightbringer" already exists. It simply needs to be found by Azor Ahai. There is no one in the show that has the skill and powers or any combination of people, such as Gendry, Melisandre, Qyburn, whatever, to forge such a sword.
I don't know if it's supposed to be as literal as people are making it out to be. 
But Arya is not an irritating flaming b!tch like Dany. 
And the story of Arya is a story of revenge. 
Dany, otherwise, is a story of empowerment and sacrifice.
 
You know, I kinda like this idea. This whole scene between Jon and Arya could easily be interpreted as foreshadowing - "stick 'em with the pointy end", her trying to hug him and almost stabbing him, "I will miss you", "all the best swords have names"...

Might actually be foreshadowing of Lightbringer.
Have same feeling about arya most fans believe it will be Sansa who may die if she marries Jon she becomes nissa nissa but I think they will do the sacrifice differently this time so it doesn't mimic Azor ahai  killing his wife there is a reason arya was given the ability to change faces and I think will have a tragic end GM already hinted the finale  will have a Star Wars like ending  your theory fits with that .
Looks like a layout error rather than a factual one.
This is a publishing error. She is the daughter of Aerys. Rhaegar is her brother. Viserys should also be moved over to be listed as son of Aerys and brother of Rhaegar as well. 
She is the Mad king's daughter, to my knowledge. What is this book?
She is. Rhaenys, Aegon, and that bastard are Rhaegar's kids while Rhaegar, Viserys, and Daenerys are the mad kings children. Rhaella died giving birth to Daenerys not Elia.

*"Daenerys is the only daughter and youngest child of King Aerys II Targaryen, the "Mad King", and his sister-wife, Rhaella."* [source](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Daenerys_Targaryen) 
Probably a publishing error. Or if anything it is because they are second and third in line to the throne. Not very significant compared to Rhaegar. 
Good catch, perhaps you should notify the publisher. 
Simplest answer I can give is that Arya's whole Faceless Man arc is stupid. 
Remember that in Season 2, Jaqen changed his face before leaving Arya's company. So either he has them rolled up in his pack someplace and is really quick with his sleight of hand or... it's magic.

The annoying thing is that we see Arya taking a face from the Hall and then putting it back, which implies that one must have their face on your own. However, later in the scene when Arya is rapidly taking faces off the supposedly poisoned Jaqen, implying that one can wear more than one face (and the faces of someone living because *magic*).

So we can then come to the conclusion that Jaqen did his first face swap we see *without* having to carry it around because he has them queued up on his face with Faceless Man magic.

A baseless alternative is that the more advanced Faceless Men have a magical connection to the Hall of Faces and can call on the identity of any face stored there... or standing in it (in the case of Arya). This would mean any sufficiently skilled Faceless Man can shed identities without having to return home. 

Personally, I think that, since Arya is a bit of a novice, that she has learned how to take someone's Face/Off and use it for her own using magic. She probably only takes the face of someone she recently killed and discards them afterwards instead of keeping them for later (wouldn't want to get caught with them). In any case, it seems that, so far, she hasn't learned the trick of queuing them up.
She was in the Hall before Jaqen came in, and has stolen a face before. She could've taken any number of faces.
I wouldn't even know how the practical use of the faces would work, like do they carry faces around? Once they take a face off they just forget about it so I just assumed that it's some GoT like magic when u put your hand against your face you get another face.. might just be me haven't gotten to that part in the books yet
After Arya killed the Waif, Jaqen said she was 'no one'. So I think she now has the power to wear other faces. I'm not exactly sure how it works though. I'm guessing some kind of magic because I don't see any other way it would be possible.
Not sure either, but i presume she did learn it partly before she left. Also maybe she just took a face with her before she left. This is not a Everything post so wont talk about a theory i've read. 
> It's quite possible that I just don't understand how the swapping faces thing works

Yup...Unless the books clarify, Arya is whatever the plots wants her to be

my theory is that it's kind've like melisandre's necklace where she isn't physically wearing the face, but moreso a trick of the eye.
Jaqen declared that she is finally no one, and the faces are for no one. So she can wear them without consequences now.

It's not supposed to be entirely clear at the moment, don't worry. I was confused too.
How is it that we get two threads today asking this exact same question? Keep watching, people. You questions will be answered eventually. 
I'd be treading close to spoiler territory if I went into any more detail, but basically Theon's men betrayed him in order to make a deal with the Northern men outside. You'll find out more when you watch season 3.
I think that the intent was to leave viewers questioning about the events at Winterfell.  As you point out, there are many unanswered questions to be asked.
Those events are supposed to be confusing. It'll become clear in the next season what  was really going on. Although it will take a while, and you'll be all the more confused at first.
This is actually one of the worst changes from the books to show.Im in favour of most of the deviations they did,but this one was confusing if you didnt have a reference point.But as others have said it will all become clear what happened and why.

Obligatory Reek Reek Reek it rhymes with meek 
[Season 3 Spoilers](#s "Roose Bolton's son, Ramsey is leading the besiegers.  Theon's men had made a deal with Ramsey to save their own skin in exchange for Theon and Winterfell. As for the people, Winterfell was slowly abandoned during Theon's 'Reign'. This was a change from the books and one I'm not in favor of. I think it was executed poorly and confusingly.  The good thing is that it keeps you from really guessing who Theon's host is at the start of season 3. Edit....Pretty sure Ramsey killed the men he made the deal with")
Theon's men did not kill him

Prepare for Robert's rebellion spin off lol.
I'm worried that the episodes won't be enough, since it will be a total of 13. There are so much theories so much inexplained, so much visions. I hope they don't cut too much out of the series 
Honestly, think of Harry Potter. That ended in 2011 and people are still talking about it. The fact that they've got another series of movies also helps.

GOT will probably be away for a couple years, but there will still be theories and headcanons. Im 99% sure we're getting some sort of spin off. It just makes sense.
I can't wait for all the "Just finished game of thrones and (blank)" posts.
Don't worry the wait for ADOS will keep you busy for the next 10 years.

Lets not contemplate the end....shhhhhhh

I'm upset by just the thought of not having a dose of Ice and Fire every year. I have watched from the very first episode (I've read the book a couple time too)... life will be empty.
Overwhelmed is a good way to put it. I think the events leading up to the ending are going to be an emotional roller coaster. Unfortunately, I can't imagine most of the characters living up to the finale, so we are going to be dealing with a lot of deaths in a little amount of time. 
I like it that you used "bittersweet" because that's the exact word which GRRM used to describe the ending.
Plenty of discussions are still being held for the Lord of the Rings trilogy (the books, not the film).
No. The tower where the candle was supposed to be lit was an abandonned one. The editing misdirected us. It made us think for a moment that Reek was going to do it, but then when he arrives at the room where Ramsey is, we realize he wasn't climbing *the* tower, he was going straight to Ramsey to tell on Sansa.
That wasn't the same room. He was never going to light the candle because he was still loyal to Ramsay. He was going to Ramsay's quarters, not the abandoned tower.
When the candle was lit Ramsay was out of the castle about to fight Stannis.
the tower was actually the same tower which bran fell off of nicknamed the broken tower because it's just ruins. but no theon actually went directly to ramsay to tell him about the candle plan. it would be kind've weird of ramsay just happened to be eating dinner at the top of an abandoned tower.
I think that the tower Brienne told Sansa to light the candle in was abandoned and not in use. I could bd wrong, but that's how I remembered it. 
that had me a little confused too at first; it didn't seem like Reek was going to Ramsey...but they just wanted us to hope for a moment he was going to help her out.

You should have seen op's face without the necklace..
Pretty stoked on my last-minute Mel, whipped up in about an hour--including homemade necklace, which is actually made of cardboard, hot glue, and gold nail polish. 
Wow thanks for dropping by  Carice van Houten!

Seriously well done. 
Oh. Damn. 

I thought that was the real actor until I looked in the comments. REALLY good necklace and makeup/everything. 
You should visit a comic con like this, the photo requests would be endless!
Good cosplay without relying on the power of cleavage. 
For a few seconds there, I thought that was Carice Van Houten.
What is this wicked sorcery, cosplayer?
The stone kinda looks like a jolly rancher lol
Nice try melisandra
you got her 'pursed lip smirk-slash-srsface' expression down flat, and great job on the necklace for an hour's work!

The impressive part is how you've also genetically managed to make yourself look just like her.
you look more like Carice van Houten than Carice van Houten
Seven hells, nice job! Also your eyebrows are amazing, nice job with those too^please ^tell ^me ^your ^secrets
Give us a selfie reenacting the scene of the birth of Stannis' shadow baby.
Please don't take off your necklace. 
Wow! Your resemblance to Carice in uncanny. Well done! :D
I sorta don't believe this isn't actually Carice van Houten...
This picture just resurrected me from the dead.  This shit is stronger then coffee. 
Find any king's blood?  Great job! As everyone else has already said you look just like her.
Wait, is this not the real chick?
The night is dank and full of memes 
I'm not entirely convinced this isn't just Carice van Houten cosplaying as someone cosplaying as Mel.
Well done Lady Melisandre.

nice necklace grandma
I would burn men for you
Wow, she's gorgeous.

You look great!!
That is awesome! You look great! 
You have the facial expression down and everything!
Fantastic effort and quite stunning to boot
You look a lot like my friend, if she wore makeup!  
I seriously thought it was Carice Van Houten until I read the comments. Stunning! 

Good job. 
what's up with all these people looking like GoT actors D:
STUNNING!
Whatever you're doing, it's working.
I like it. You did an excellent job.
Holy crap. This might be the best looking cosplay I've seen on here.

It helps when you're a clone of the actress though...
This is amazing.
Damn, amazing.
I was really confused for a couple of seconds especially if I only looked at the thumbnail.
Slay girl. Slay them all <3
That's really good wow
Go on Love...take off that choker! I dare ya!

Ha! hi Melanie 👋🏻
Holy gorgeous 😍
Damn. I thought you were Carice until I read the comments. :)
That's a good likeness! Your eyes are almost identical to Carice's!
What's with all the doppelgangers suddenly? I had no idea everyone on GoT has a twin out there.

Doubtful. Very very doubtful. Cool. But Doubtful.
The thing is that theories are backed up by something, this would definitely be a surprise but it just makes no sense story-wise.
>Jon teams up with Danerys and her dragons which sets up an epic battle against Sansa, the Night King, and the White Walkers.

And buries his sword deep into her heart and something something lightbringer?
She wasn't really upset much until she saw Littlefinger.   That being said, having the Night King hunt Sansa down to turn her into his queen is an interesting idea.
I think the irony of Sansa becoming a queen would be great.
Sansa as the night queen?...... this is a twist I have not considered.  

There is another Sansa theory I really like (that seems to line up with some book foreshadowing and where she is in the books) that supposes that there will be an avalanche at the Eyrie while she is there.

Perhaps the Night King marches on the Eyrie and causes the avalanche?
The Walkers still have to figure out a way around the spells in the Wall that prevent them from passing through it.  
  
I could see there being a rivalry especially if/when littlefinger gets involved, but I think Sansa knows Jon's leadership and military prowess are what's best for the North especially since the assumption is that they'll be rebelling against the Iron Throne again.....................calling Jon King in the North = leaving the Iron Throne's rule, which Cersei sure won't take kindly too.
I think if that happens she can end up like her uncle benjey that would be very sad and if rumors are true Jon Sansa fall in love I think Jon will have hard time killing her even if she is turned into a WW or Jon sacrifices himself to be with her they rule as King and Queen of WW and Dany needs to fight them 
I was thinking something similar only that Jon would turn himself white walker in a last ditch effort. It's believed the night king was stark himself before turning in the flashback. Now I think a twist could be that the fire in his blood has some sort of counter, allowing him to maintain his true self if that makes sense. As for Sansa, I think she believes her power is in manipulation. In the books Baelish actually teaches Sansa how to use people and that calculated steps backward is good strategy. Sansa and Jon are brother and sister and don't pose a threat to each other.

Unsotobbale!
i was gonna say just give it a rest, it's too deep into the off season for this shit. But this idea is actually lit

I'm sorry for no post last Wednesday, it's been a tough couple of weeks, but we're back this week with some ancient history. I love the ambiguity inherent in the Age of Heroes, just like when we start looking back far enough in our own past things become blurry. I also love the questions it raises about the current story line, most notably for one character in particular. 

Also, as everyone knows the show passed the books in S6 and I still think the biggest shock I got was the jaw dropping revelation that the Children created the White Walkers. Something I barely ever see anyone talking about and I also believe will be consistent in the books. An answer to such a huge question in the series flew almost completely under the radar. We finally figured out what the Others were and their purpose, so many theories destroyed in a single moment. 
GRRM has basically told a story so deep I want spinoffs of every single piece of it.

The Age of Heroes just reminds me of Greek mythologies and that's never a dull subject.
>Sorry, they all start to run together in my head like they were all one person.

Hmmm.... :)
Something refreshing to read after viewing multiple cosplay pics . Thanks .
Ohhh, so Varys must have gotten his merman genetics from the Grey King, that makes sense now.  In all seriousness, do you think the Grey King has anything to do with the Manderlys?
What's the over under on Bran becoming Brandon somehow?
Wasn't there in the Vale a hero who mounted a giant eagle? Or I got confused?

Frame capture ?
This was a while back. Pity she wasn't allowed to sit on it, there was a rule stating that (at least) the British monarch is not allowed to sit on any foreign thrones, fictional or real.
I can just imagine her saying, "We should get one like this."
Azor Ahai confirmed
Looks like Varys with hair standing next to it

Only 7 Kingdoms? Pff.
Long has she reigned!

She didn't sit on the throne because it was illegal for the Queen to sit on a foreign throne.


I'm adamant that she has watched the show! 
Varys looks so off-putting with hair.
Bet you she's considering getting one made.
OMG, Varys is Whispering little bird secrets into her ears!!
"pitiful"
I sure hope not because he wasn't just sitting there then all of a sudden started shouting burn them. He had been crazy and obsessed with fire for a while and his quotes he's clearly talking about King's Landing. Hell his hand Qarlton Chelsted found out and tried to quit then got burned and Ayres named his pyromancer as hand of the king. 

>"The traitors want my city, but I’ll give them naught but ashes. Let Robert be king over charred bones and cooked meat"

>"Burn them all," Aerys said, "Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds." 
Yeah it's said before, that bran's in-vision-warging might have made him mad. Just as hodor became hodor.

Brans warging could *possibly* have something to do with it. 

Edit: Or not
Its the long version of Bran Like Hodor is the short version of Hold the Door 
It's possible.

It's hard to tell what the "ideal outcome" is in all of this; is it a reversion to the orginal seven, completely independent Kingdoms? Or is it a return to Targaryen (or Stargaryen) rule?

Personally, I think it's all going to end with Jaehaerys Stargaryen sitting on the Iron Throne, with the Vale remaining one of its constituent kingdoms (albeit with great autonomy than it currently enjoys). #Valxit
They are in open rebellion against the current crown. We'll have to see how long Cersei gets to keep the crown to really be sure. Its possible that if Dany wins the throne they would swear allegiance to her again, especially if Job makes a deal involving dragons and White Walkers. 

If Cersei keeps the crown, the Vale could possibly swear fealty to Jon. I just can't imagine a scenario where they split off into their own kingdom again. That would require a leader worth rallying around and Robyn doesn't provide that. He's annoying, bratty, and has no military skill whatsoever. 
Keep in mind that only Yohn and the 3-5,000 Knights at Winterfell acclaimed Jon as King in the North. As the Vale is not and never has been part of the North, that was neither their right nor heritage to do so, but they probably got caught up in the moment.

Again, the Vale is not of the North. It is the most Andal of the Kingdoms, where the Faith is the strongest. The North is the last bastion of the First Men and worship the Old Gods.

The exact military strength is not known, but is around 20,000 Knights. Knights, as feudal men-at-arms, have a limit on their service to their Lord, usually a period of 30-90 days, after which they have to be paid or they can go home, EXCEPT when the service is within and in defense of the Vale itself. This is why Littlefinger brought 3-5,000 Knights. He needed to keep the others available for service, the situation in the North limited the strength he could bring logistically and the timeframe he could bring them to battle as it would take weeks to go from the Vale through the River Lands, across the Neck and on to Winterfell.
 
That means that the 15-17,000 Knights that stayed at home in the Vale DID NOT acclaim Jon as King in the North. Lord Baelish, the Lord Protector of the Vale in the minority of Lord Robyn Arryn, DID NOT acclaim Jon as King in the North. The Council DID NOT acclaim Jon as King in the North. 

This is a feudal society. Certainly Ramsey Bolton was Lord Bolton as heir of his father. This didn't automatically make him Lord Paramount and Warden of the North as his father was. This is a Royal appointment since the time of Aegon the Conqueror. Tommen would have had to confirm Ramsey in these offices to give him that authority and power as the King's Man in the North. Since he hadn't been confirmed, the BoB and his eventual death was a simply feudal inter-House squabble, that returned the Starks to Winterfell and eliminated the Boltons. At this point, the Starks were simply another House in the North, their title as Lords Paramount and Warden in the North having been surrendered on Ned's execution. No one at this point in the North was in rebellion to the Crown.

When the Northern Houses acclaimed Jon as King in the North, and legitimized him as a Stark in doing so, they essentially claimed independence from the Iron Throne. In the eyes of the Crown, which is now Cersei, they are in rebellion. 

The Vale, however, is neither in alliance with the North or in rebellion to the Crown. The Lord Protector, with the advice of the Council, is still free to make alliances. He faces a faction which is in favor of an alliance with the North. But this faction is not powerful enough at this time to endanger his position and power. Should Sansa's marriage to Tyrion Lannister by annulled by the Faith, she could marry Lord Robyn. This could be bad for LF, as Sansa would now compete with him for control of Lord Robyn, with all the advantages Marjory had with Tommen, and with the knowledge of his murder of Lysa, which could wreck his support in the Council. So he will get out of Winterfell as soon as possible, to keep control of Lord Robyn, and block any marriage with Sansa. 

Then he can shop the 15-17,000 Knights to the highest bidder. Cersei once before promised him Lord Paramount and Warden in the North. Maybe she promises him more. The Vale sits right on the northern border of the Crown Lands within days march of King's Landing, when Cersei might have 6,000 Lannister professionals, maybe 20,000 Lannister and Crown Land levies and possibly some Iron Born, if she allies with Euron. For Dany, those 15,000 Knights could end the war quickly, moving on King's Landing as she marches through the Storm Lands with her 9,000 Unsullied, 10-15,000 Dothraki, 5,000 Tyrell professional pikemen and 15-20,000 Reach and Dornish levies (of  yea, and the three dragons, if Euron didn't find "Dragonbinder").

If Cersei wins, she will seek to reunite the Seven Kingdoms under her rule. Danerys Stormborn has promised the Iron Islands their independence through Yara/Theon's support. It would seem she is making alliance with the North. Jon Stark, King in the North can offer little at this time, other than to secure the River Lands. He can only deploy a limited number of the Northern levies at this point, mostly Manderlys and Glovers. Maybe 10,000 men for 30-90 days. But coordinating with the Tullys, if Edmure gets out and given his hatred of Jainie and the Lannisters, they can suppress the Freys in their current disorder with Walder and his two oldest sons dead. With Danerys in the Storm Lands and the Reach and Dorne secured, the Lannisters would be cut off from Casterly Rock and contained inside the Crown Lands without room to maneuver, where Danerys can force them to battle or into King's Landing for a siege. Otherwise, the North has limited powers to intervene in the war. Perhaps Jon negotiates limited support and submission for autonomy through his marriage to Danerys.

Danerys talks of breaking the wheel, so slowly breaking up the Seven Kingdoms would be an outcome of such an objective, unless her idea of breaking the wheel means eliminating all the noble houses, thus ending the strife. Independence for the Iron Islands and autonomy for the North, the Vale and Dorne would be such a path.

Jon Snow is now Jon Stark, the acknowledged bastard son of Edard Stark, legitimized by acclamation by the Northern Lords as King in the North (who's name is Stark). As Lyanna's and Rhaegar's unacknowledged bastard son, he has no last name and no family rights to any inheritance. IF (BIG IF) Danerys Targaryan were to legitimize him, as a male and as her older brother's son, he would have a better claim to the Iron Throne. IS Dany really ready to just hand over the Throne? Jon doesn't want the Iron Throne, he didn't want to be King in the North. Besides, just who is going to believe Bran is the Three-Eyed Raven and his vision? Other than the two maids, who were with probably with Lyanna (she's a noble of a Great House, she isn't going to be keeping house with Rhaegar by herself) from the "kidnapping" and thus know that it was Rhaegar that "quickened" her and that the baby they gave Ned Stark is Rhaegar's son, no one else REALLY knows. Howland Reed was badly wounded and was soon in shock and bleeding out while Ned was in the ToJ. No way Howland makes it up the stairs. He may not even have been conscious when Ned came back down the stairs with the baby and the two maids. He'd wake up, there would be the two maids and Ned and the baby. He could conjecture that Ned picked up the baby at the ToJ, but if he was under for a couple days, he wouldn't know for sure and Ned could tell him he had gone and picked up the baby from its mother and hired the women to attend Howland's wound and the baby. If the maids are still alive, and I doubt Ned would kill them (he probably brought them north with the baby and settled them near Winterfell to keep an eye on them), they might confirm Bran's vision, otherwise it would be best for everyone if Bran just kept his mouth shut.
The Vale situation is confusing.  I am not sure why they would swear fealty to Jon especially since they have loyalty to Sansa, not Jon.  However, they are in open defiance of the Crown.
Personally, I think Robin is going to die in Season 7 - then Baelish will somehow take over the Vale completely.  He can use the Knights of the Vale to serve his own purpose (which may not necessarily align perfectly with either Sansa or Jon). 

After he takes over the Vale and all the power that comes with it, he'll use the Knights to "clean up" the aftermath of any other battles or skirmishes and pick off the weak estates one by one. That's what Petyr is - he picks off the weak to make himself stronger; he doesn't go for the main prize right away.

The Vale is involved because Sansa asked Littlefinger to help.

1) now they owe him - 
2) Littlefinger can't be trusted.

He is going to try to put a rift between Jon and Sansa - 

Here's my theory: Littlefinger tries to split Jon and Sansa; Sansa pretends to be all pissed off and agrees to head south with LF to take the Iron Throne. She flips the script on LF using him to get herself on the Iron Throne, or at least getting LF out of the picture so that Dany can take the throne; because of Tyrion's negotiations/help, and Sansa recognizing that Tyrion is really a good guy (cause of how he treated her while they were married)
What is sure is that the Vale is now again a free piece in the Game,  away from Robyn [that noble that Littlefinger almost killed], don't fear Littlefinger anymore and may even try to get rid of him. 
If we are looking at how Robb's coronation was with the Riverlands. I think the Vale is apart of the independent kingdom of the North.

Also, This is still Wot5K. It's just the third phase.
I think it happened as we saw on screen, they proclaimed Jon as king.
Littlefinger explicitly said to Sansa that he (and by proxy The Vale) have declared for House Stark.
That doesnt mean Jon though, could mean just Sansa as he tries another power play
Other than Young Griff being a Blackfyre, they'll be another Dance of Dragons with Daenerys. Young Griff will initially be successful in gaining favor with the old faithful houses (Highgarden and Dorne, maybe even betrothed with Arianne?) and when Daenerys arrives with Dothraki and armies from Essos, they'll clash over the dragons. Jon Connington will probably spread greyscale, making Young Griff's reign start to become unpopular, making it more easy for Dany to swoop in and overthrow him. Dany gets the houses and adds to her army.
He's a blackfyre supported by the spider and the magistar.
Considering he's not even in the show, I seriously doubt he has a significant role in anything.
Soon comes the pale mare, and after her the others. Kraken and dark flame, lion and griffin, the sun's son and the mummer's dragon. Trust none of them. Remember the Undying. Beware the perfumed seneschal.

The mummer is obviously Varys and aegon his dragon.Dorne will ally with him and he will eventually discover the truth and kneel to danerys who will grant him some lands or the old blackfyre lands.I just hope it moves the plot along rather then being a filler book.

Ideally i would like to see stannis defeat the Boltons with his frozen lake plan.And have the north,vale,riverlands to ally behind Jon.The south and dorne behind Aegon,and cersei and euron allied up,with Dany arriving and taking casterly rock.All the while the white walkers take down the wall.
Well, the popular theory is: he's a Blackfyre.
He's not a real Targaryen. Something about a prophecy of the Mummer's Dragon, aka fake Dragon.

Thank you asian Morrissey
Well done my friend. I fucking love this song.  
Makes me wanna conquer lands.
[deleted]
I think you got it wrong. 

Season 2 didnt have a happy ending. Tywin, Joffrey and Cersei won while Tyrion was left broken and injured in a dark room without any appreciation for what he did while everybody else were rewarded for their roles in the victory, such as Little Finger. Jon had to kill Half hand. Winterfell was sacked and Maester Luwin died.

So I dont think there is a one happy ending, one sad ending thing really going on.
You may be on to something my friend. Cercei is definitely getting dead in Season 7 so that's happy, and I don't think they will kill Jon AGAIN so soon so he's okay. I'm guessing Theon is a dead man (well, dead person). Other than those, I really don't give a white walker's ass what happens to the rest of them.
Season 6 ended happily? This list seems pretty subjective to me
im suprised you didn't mention stannis for the season 5 one
I think the story vould have Ceresi dying in season 7, my guess is D&D will keep her into season 8
Season 6 ended happily? Cersei killed most members of a Great House, her son committed suicide, Westeros is about to be invaded by foreigners, Dorne and the Reach are about to be in open revolt, and White Walkers are getting ready to head South. But happy ending because Jon is king and Ramsey was killed.
id say that the season we probably will have littlefinger dying so the north is united fully, a dragon dying  perhaps becoming wightified unless hardhornes  ice dragon was real.. and the wall coming down so we have a high note to open season 8 on. 
The whole series is about different points of view depending on your family. Everyone has their reasons for their actions. I know a few people who root for Cersei to win the whole thing.
I think Sansa or Arya might die
I was not happy about the battle of the blackwater, i wanted Stannis to sack the city and kill Joff and Cersie.

The show runners have said Dany is ruthless, not evil. There is a difference. I agree she needs some counsel because she does get blinded by her emotions, but I think she is a grey character, she is neither purely good or purely evil and it's naive to think she's just going to go mad after a very long and complicated character arc about the balance between ruling and conquering. 
I don't think she will turn out to be a villain like Aerys II but she has that ruthless streak Targaryens do. Even Aegon the Conqueror who was thought as a good King, burned people.
Dany's a young and impulsive girl who spent most of her life as an abused commodity and has a desire to save others from similar lives. She's a well intentioned person who has made bad decisions out of poor guidance and emotional outbursts. But unlike many other characters, Dany feels remorseful, reexamines herself, and tries to deal with the contradictions between the need to resort to violence to rule and her desire for peace. 

She's kind and compassionate and uses the power she has to help others, but she can also be ruthless. It's like she has two sides, mother and dragon. When she feels something is incredibly unjust or evil she grows angry and feels like responding with violence. Her actions are supposed to be morally ambiguous. 

She's a ruler who steps out of her castle to feed, wash, and comfort diseased people with the bloody flux at her own risk. How many rulers in Westeros or Essos can claim that?

Especially on the books, her overall course of action in Meereen is an impressive series of self-sacrifices and self-submissions for "her people" and for peace. 
Well seing that a she was in a middle of a war and fleet was attacking her,destroying their cities is a logical idea.
Do I think the lady invading Westeros with a slave army, a dothraki horde, and dragons while being advised by a kinslaying, kingslaying, twisted little demon monkey is the villain?
So can I put a spin on this a different way?

Rulers in GOT have had varying relationships with their Advisers.  Robert and Tommen basically let theirs run the realm.  Joffery did as well...except when he "helped out" by making a few more enemies.  Stannis favored the Red Woman's council above all, though Davos could occasionally sway him.  Rob trusted a few, but also walked his own path (which in no small part led to his downfall).

Daenerys has, I think, the best relationship with hers.  She is surrounded by some very capable people, and is willing to heed their council (eventually) while maintaining her own agenda.  She "sells" her dragon against her adviser's council, but defers to them on how best to conquer a city.  She abolishes slavery in her new kingdom, but reluctantly relents to open the fighting pit for the good of the realm.

I think this is one of several factors that could make her a great ruler.
Targaryen children are a flip of the coin.  Some fall to the madness and some are good-hearted and go on to do great things.  I think Daenerys is definitely a good egg
I don't think she will get this bad but I think it would be awesome if it was a war of mad queens between dany and cersei 
I was hoping...but D&D said she isn't evil...too bad that would have been interesting.
Well, she is a Targaryen
The madness might develop over time
Absolute power corrupts absolutely.  And those with good intentions can become the most corrupted.
Dany's fate is yet to be decided. That's why it's fun to talk about it; she's complicated. Those defending her says she's a gray character...returning the slave cities to dust doesn't mean she'll burn them ALL...I say crucifying 163 slave master without trail; burning a man alive and letting him be eaten by dragons without determining his guilt to make a point and having to be convinced not to destroy complete cities doesn't look good on the CV. 

It's very dangerous to say "But they were bad people" 

I feel like GRRM is trying slow walk us to "Power corrupts" 
Would Dany have ruled this way if she didn't have dragons? Would she have freed the slaves if she didn't need a slave army? Or if she could afford to buy them? We'll never know. It's a balancing act and so far she's not looking great BUT she's not fallen over yet.

Yes because advisors "shaming" a monarch was typically how they'd go about advising said monarch. Somehow I doubt people raised inside "shaming culture" would last very long as advisors to, well, *anyone.*
Her father was a good ruler at the start but went down the path daenarys is now by having good advisers like tywin but then ultimately ignoring them in the end
Danaerys has a massive god complex. She's not evil. She'd be less dangerous if she were evil. People who believe that everything they do must be good just because they're the ones doing it are way scarier than your average villain.
I think it will happen, and the only way to turn the audience against Dany, because she's so popular, is have her turn on Tyrion, Jorah, Arya, Varys, and/or Jon Snow.
She won't become a villain and remains overturning all forms of oppression in the known world. She still wants to break the wheel and I think she has the firepower to do it. She's not a pollyanna figure and Tyrion has done an excellent job of educating her on principles of realpolitik. She had adequate advisors for conquering before Tyrion but now she has a consigliere that she needs/deserves for ruling. Tyrion's not perfect but he has the right intuitions and institutional knowledge to help make her agenda a reality.

So, no, she's not a villain but you know what Harvey Dent says....
I have said this since she stole the Unsullied. She straight up lied to the face of Kraznys mo Nakloz and then roasted him alive without a shred of remorse. 

She takes what she feels she deserves without regard to who she hurts. IMHO, she is almost no better than Viserys, she's just hot and a main character, so she is justified in doing what she does.

Mark my words, she will end up being the ultimate villian, forget Cersei. 
yes.
Danerys Targaryan is the scion of a Royal House, despite having lived in exile and impoverished. She was tutored for an education, she had no contemporaries or even near-equals to grow up with other than her selfish, consumed brother. She was surrounded by servants who did what they were told and never stood up to her. Her story arc through being "sold" to a Dothraki Lord and essentially raped as a consummation, then finds love with Drogon and a loyal friend in Jorah Mormont. She still, however, gets her way as the Khaleesi. When Drogon dies and she lives through the pyre, she becomes a "goddess" and Khaleesi and everyone does what she says, though she soon acquires additional advisors that she trusts and can shape her responses in Ser Barriston Selmi, Missandai, Grey Worm and finally, Tyrion. Remember that she broke her word when she sold the dragon for the Unsullied and then burnt the Master, took back the dragon and had the Unsullied kill the rest. But still, she is a autocrat, with no real limit on her powers other than what her people and dragons will do or not do for her. Notice that SHE GRANTED the Iron Isles their independence for Yara and Theon's support. Now if she actually marries Jon and spends time with him, that would certainly be another break on her tendency towards direct action. But do you really think she could actually accept real limits on her authority and powers like a constitutional monarch like say the 16th-19th century English monarchy?
Anybody that has read the books knows that Jon and Dany will die.

This is not a happy fairytale.   Its the song of the god damn ice and fire.   And the ice and fire has to die to restore the seasons of planetos back to normal. 


Most of the main characters will die in the end and magic will leave the world.
It's hard to reason with someone who has, as my favorite YouTube commentator would say, "three big f**k-off dragons"!!! You are correct, I think power will blind Daenerys, first of her name, mother of dragons, the unburnt...etc. She's got a temper...mingle that with power and we've got a malakoff cocktail. She also has compassion, but that is merely the other side of rage. It all depends on who she is forced to meet.
On pure facts, this is wrong for the same reason that Jon can't be Robert's: Lyanna had been gone for too long. If Jon had been conceived before Lyanna's disappearance, Baby Jon would have been visibly older than Baby Robb and Ned's story wouldn't make sense.

Your girlfriend makes a mean Tormund.
We made the costumes ourselves from assorted clothing and bedding items we picked up at thrift stores over the past month or two. It was definitely a fun experience, and makes me want to make my own costume again in the future.

Nice dude!
The show doesn't feature the full 10-minute track. Djawadi has put in various cues from the piece at critical hit points (i.e. the wild organ solo right when [Ep6.10](#s "Lancel gets stabbed") or the main motif coming back in when the camera [Ep6.10](#s "pans down to reveal the candle in the wildfire"). Because of the scene taking priority over the piece's running time, the episode is missing a chunk from the studio recording.

How much did you pay for them?
The crafter did a really nice job
Which stall? I was at the Ohio Ren Fair a few weeks ago, but I totally missed these!!
They are fantastic. Were they for sell?
I have beautiful eggs as well! I literally show them off to anybody who comes to my home... even if they don't care about GOT. Lol if there was a fire, I'd grab them first. Or maybe I'd leave them behind and dragons would hatch 🤔

The tone and wording of this post is the literal definition of cringe
I wouldn't want it of that time era. There are people in the show now that would make it so confusing to watch plus I know some people who get pissed if the character doesn't act the same and have the same humor as the other. If I would do a movie it would be of Aegons conquest they could add soooooo much more then a story most people know(Rheagar story). Plus a HUGH negative no dragons, Aegons conquest 3 badass dragons plus the biggest of all time(so far). While Rheagar movie would be good this would be GREAT. Plus they could answer some unanswered questions like what really was in that note that made Aegon stop assaulting dorne? Plus others that I don't remember or know. So while #lastdragonmovie might be catchy there is no dragons so I would rather pick something different with "real" ones. You could also do the Rhoynish war 300 dragon would look epic plus tell us alot more about valyria and other dragon riding families. 
You wear that dress, girl! Dracarys as hell. 
I don't know if it was intentional to have those two horses on the background (to symbolise the entry to Vaes Dothrak and her Dothraki past), but certainly a great touch!
Dragon eggs on the table 
Ill ride that dragon

Sweet costume, but let's see more of that dog in the background.
Nah, Robert sent Ned to Kings Landing in his place because he was injured on the Trident. Robert had a claim to the Throne through his ancestor Orys Baratheon who had Targ blood. That's why Robert was called the Usurper, because after the Mad King called for his (and Ned's) head he rebelled and called all of his banners. Ned was never trying to win the Throne nor did he want it. If Robert had been at King's Landing he would have just sat on the Throne himself, and potentially killed Jamie.
> I just want up votes for making a non-costune thread

After what this sub became in this past week, hell yeah you earned it man

> I think the Throne went to Robert because Ned entered the Throne Room before Rober

Nah man, the throne went to Bobby B because his grandma was a Targaryen. He was groomed to be a leader since he's also the heir of the Stormlands.

Ned just newly assumed lordship of the Stark family after the death of Rickard and Brandon, plus he never wanted the crown in the first place. 


> I just want up votes for making a non-costune thread.

Please let Halloween be over.
Killing Rhaegar would also play a role,what happened first? The sack of KL or the Ruby ford? 
Also Robert was a young man with no real idea of the tedium of ruling. At that point I'd say he was quite happy to be king.
If Robert entered the Throne room first he would can claimed the throne for himself. He has Targaryen blood which gave him legitimacy to the throne.
Everybody saying Robert had Targaryen blood..that didn't matter. He took the throne through right of conquest. Meaning, he legitimately took it via war. The only person that mattered to is Ned, who said "You had the better claim", but that was just Ned being Ned and not wanting to seek out power.
"I just want up votes for making a non-costume thread."

You've earned it OP.
First kudos to you for a non-costume thread!  
  
I think Robert would have just claimed the throne for himself quite frankly, as others have mentioned his Targ lineage for one, Ned having just taken over as Warden in the North for another. But also remember Ned didn't even want to be Hand of the King, you think he'd have wanted the Iron Throne?  
  
Robert grew up the oldest heir so he always had the ambition to be a Lord Paramount, Ned was the second oldest and wasn't destined to be an heir, it wasn't until his dad and brother got killed that he all of a sudden became a Leige Lord.
Robert started the war using his claim on the throne since his grandmother was a Targ, Ned had no blood claim on the Iron Throne.

I think a more interesting "what if" scenario in this time period would be what if Ned had arrived at King's Landing before Tywin?  The Targaryan kids would have been spared, as would Elia. Would Jamie have let the king burn the Stark army, since it wasn't his father's life on the line?
did he not announce his intention to take the throne before the trident?
Well no actually, during the entirety of the rebellion Robert Ned and Jon decided Robert would be king if they won because he had the best claim to the throne
I think (and this never would have happened) if Ned had really wanted The Throne, Robert would have let him have it. 
When King Aerys II was murdered by Jaimie and King's Landing sacked by the Lannisters, who killed Rhaegar's wife and children, the Vale under Jon Arryn, the North under Edard Stark and the Tullys were allied to Robert Baratheon. The Lannisters had just gone from neutral to anti-Targaryan, but not necessarily pro-Robert. Dorne and Highgarden had supported the Targaryans as had some of the minor houses in the other Kingdoms. Danerys and her brother were in impoverished exile. 

Neither Jon nor Ned wanted the Throne. Maybe Robert did and he had the best blood claim. No would accept Tywin. Dorne just wanted to be left alone, had resisted conquest by the Targaryans and could do so again against the Baratheons. No one though Mace Tyrell worthy of Highgarden, much less the Throne. Robert was the best bet as far as pulling the Seven Kingdoms back together after the Rebellion. If Robert had died of his wounds, then Renly would have been the next best candidate by bloodline and Ned by reputation, but it would probably have resulted in further civil war. Remember Ned was of the North, a descendent of the First Men who worshipped the Old Gods. The South would have not welcomed a Northern King in King's Landing.
Ned and Cat would have served as King and Queen, obviously.

Next, I think it depends on how old Benjen was when he went to the Watch. If it happened after Robert claimed the throne (Ned, in this timeline), Benjen would likely have stayed on as Lord of Winterfell and married some Northern lass to shore up ties with a younger son.

From there, things would likely spiral much further away from current settings to the point that I don't have time to think about them while I'm here at work.
I'd love to do this, too bad my house words are "We do not sew".
Needs more wine . . . for both Robert and Cersei.
those costumes are 70% great job, 10% excellent attitude, 5% hands-on-hips, and 15% damn you got great hair. 
Next year you can dress up as the chief of police in Stranger Things (forgot his name).
[deleted]
She's not a sewing machine! She's your girl!
Your costume says Robert but your face says Seth Rogen 
Isn't that Renly's crown?
Impressive, esp for first effort.  Lots of straight seams make it easier, and you did very well with the little details like the frog closures on Robert's vest.
That Cersei dress is gorgeous! As a beginner sewer who is very intimidated...two thumbs up!
What is that hanging from "Robert's" belt? Maybe my screen is too small..
Damn, Cersei is fine tho
Killer! Keep it up!!!!!
Great job! My husband sewed on his Tormund costume for the first time too! Here's to gaining more skills!

GET. FUCKING. HYPE. ITS HAPPENING.



"For those keeping up with spoilers, this deluge of actors in Seville is even more telling. There are seventeen confirmed characters present at the massive Dragonpit scene: Queen Cersei Lannister, Ser Jaime Lannister, Qyburn, Ser Gregor Clegane, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, King Euron Greyjoy, Queen Daenerys Targaryen (“titles, titles…”), Tyrion Lannister, Ser Jorah Mormont, Missandei, Varys, Theon Greyjoy, King Jon Snow, Ser Davos Seaworth, Brienne of Tarth, Podrick Payne and Sandor Clegane. There may even be more to come! Nothing like this has happened in Game of Thrones ever before. The closest the show got was when the cast was much smaller and two thirds of it came together at Winterfell in the very first episode. Not even the crowded Purple Wedding comes close. This scene promises to be eventful, to say the least."

....SQUEEEE!!!!!!

I can't be *this* excited and it's only November lol.
Yes! Tychos is one of my favorite characters 
Oh boy. Could we expect Green Trial part 2? Wildfire beneath the Dragonpit? Not that I think all of these characters are going to die, obviously, but I could see things easily getting out of hand and wildfire somehow playing a part in it that takes the lives of some major characters.
That guy in the second pic looks exactly like Stevie from east bound 
> why wouldn't Ned just claim that he had slept with someone before he married Catelyn. Or even before Lyanna was even kidnapped?

And then

>Was it just because this would likely mean Jon was older?

Yep. The older Jon gets, the more of a "danger" he becomes. The first born son is a much bigger danger than second born. Catelyn maybe wouldn't feel as cheated, but the real reason she was so angry was because of the attention Jon got. If he was also the first born son of Ned, Catelyn would just lost all her marbles with fear.

>Couldn't Ned have claimed that Jon was Brandon's bastard?

That's even worse, because now Jon isn't simply a threat on Robb's claim, he a threat on Ned's claim. As the son of the first born son he would be ahead of Ned.

Now, as a bastard Jon, from a legal stand point, has no claim. But his blood claim is forever there. Jon, the first born son of Ned can rally support to his cause far easier, against his southron born younger brother and his southron mother. Jon, the son of Brandon can even go as far as to claim Ned usurp him by falsely calling him a bastard for the sake of southron alliances, and once again rally support to take Winterfell.

Because the issue of Jon was never "Ned went to war 2 weeks after meeting me and slept with another woman". The issue of Jon was that he was always around and raised as a trueborn son would be raised. All the attention, care and affection Ned gave him made Catleyn paranoid, thinking that Ned still loves that another woman and may one day favor his bastard son over his trueborn, or the boy himself, realizing that favor start using it to gain power even go as far as to usurp Robb.


Therefore Jon being conceived before or after his marriage or him being known as from Brandon doesn't make things easier. Not to mention, Jon is probably conceived before Robb anyway, as he is supposed to be a few months younger than Robb but he is ahead in the growth progress.
maybe he hadn't came up with a plan yet and someone just said hey ned is that your bastard and he went with it.
He was ordered to protect the kid, Ned and only Ned would want everyone to think Jon is his so he can complete his promise. 
The further you go away from the truth, the harder it is to maintain the lie. When Ned involves more and more people in this lie, it becomes difficult. What if he says it was the fishermans daughter, but she openly refuses it? 

Also, you have to see it from Jons perspective. If he is raised and the "truth" he knows is that he is a son of a fishers daughter or anyone else, how can Ned tell him the truth later on? Why raise him with a lie? Silence seems harsh, but makes the truth more believable. Especially if it is such a mindblowing truth.
In the book, Sansa doesn't want to pretend to be Littlefinger's bastard, but Littlefinger tells her that a bastard is the ideal cover story because it's impolite to inquire further into it. Jon being Ned's bastard deters further questioning.
Ned would never sully the memory of his dead brother.
It shows how ridiculously loyal and true Ned is that he let everyone believe he did something disloyal and untrue, including his entire family.
It'd be harder to protect a kid that isn't yours. How could Ned justify keeping someone else's bastard around when - unlike Theon - he served no political purpose?
What I want to know is why people did not seem to think that Jon could have been Lyanna's since she was kidnapped for a long period of time...
"Why would Ned take the burden on himself?"

Did you really ask this, knowing how Ned is?
Because Ned is a bad liar.

> Or even before Lyanna was even kidnapped?

That wouldn't have worked. Ned and Cat didn't marry immediately after Lyanna's disappearance. First, Rickard and Brandon went to King's Landing and died, then there was a battle at Gulltown, Ned snuck back to Winterfell, gathered his army while Robert fought a couple battles in the South, then marched South and got married. Baby Jon would have to be visibly older than Baby Robb for that story to make sense. He wasn't.
Keep in mind that it was 15 years after Robert's Rebellion. Ned wasn't much older than 18 or so when his father and older brother were murdered by King Aerys II. No one south of the Neck really knew him as the younger brother. Fostered at Lord Arryn's home from say 6 to 18, no one at Winterfell would know much of him either. He married Caitlyn and both were young and hardly knew each other, as Caitlyn was supposed to marry Brandon. His actions as Robert's right hand man, as the new Lord Stark, as a leader and warrior in battle, brought him to the attention of others and made his reputation as did his performance as Lord Paramount and Warden of the North and in suppressing the Greyjoy Rebellion. So Ned goes to war and brings a baby back to Winterfell, before Caitlyn gets to know him, before Winterfell, the Stark nobles and commoners get to know him and just after he won a reputation for courage, leadership, honorable action and individual feats of arms. At the time, he would have been no different than most young nobles at war, having sex with whores and available women. Even acknowledging Jon wasn't that unusual. What made things unusual (very) and should have attracted attention, and what probably made Caitlyn so mad, was Ned not only acknowledged Jon, he brought him into the household and raised him with his legitimate children. He created a situation of potential threat to Robb, creating sibling rivalries and the slap in the face to Caitlyn every time she saw Jon. That Jon came to understand his place, obviously accepted it, gave respect to Caitlyn as Lady of Winterfell and female head of the family, respect to Robb as the heir, made no move to displace the other children in any way in the affections of his father, wasn't enough to placate Caitlyn. But again, this was a very unusual move in a feudal society and should have caused quite a bit of interest, so staying in the North was a way to reduce that interest.
I think we forget that Ned was like seventeen at this point and had probably never been in a serious relationship. He probably just didn't think of it.
First Brienne I've seen!

And I'll upvote anything that implies Tormund and Brienne get all smoochy. :)
They went there... :D
This is her husband (Tormund in the pic). It was a heck of a lot better than our original idea to go as Jaime and Cersei. Because [That's nasty](http://www.quickmeme.com/img/8f/8fc37cac2fa5dd5a4e086044fa699be6af0ed39f7f38e970d72a5a9fb5a6c61c.jpg)

I pledge to wake randomly, and honor the night night's watch, for there may be scarey monsters nearby, for this night, and all the nights to come...

And that dog is too freaking fluffy. Stop it. 
That's actually normal Jon Snow size
I died of cute.
Looks like full sized Jon Snow
Juan snow
Looks like a young Robert Baratheon in his goth phase
This costume was made for less than 50 CAD with the help (read: did all of the work) of my mother. The cloak was made from an old set of curtains and my mom put two belts through it so they wrap around my body and keep the cloak up. Leather jacket, winter gloves, winter boots, a scream cape with the spiky bits cut off. 

Next year I would like to have a better Longclaw (this one was some bad Wal-Mart sword but it was cheap) and to add some more detail but this was a great start! I have a few more pictures (including a Doodle as Ghost) that I may upload later. Thanks all!
I feel like you would be a great Locke too

Aerys II's desire to build a second wall was just early evidence of his madness. He suffered from flights of fancy and lacked the discipline that Tywin Lannister possessed to actually accomplish great tasks for the betterment of the realm. Aerys II had a ton of different plans, schemes, designs, and interests that never lasted longer than a few days, weeks, or months (at the longest). He had many lovers and grew tired of them quickly. He was Henry VIII in Westeroes (or was that Aegon IV???) Anyway, the design to build a second wall was just a flitting fancy that never had any thought, rationale, or reason behind it. Just Aerys II doing Aerys II mad musings.
>But why? Why would he want these lands? There is nothing of any value there and there is little food there too. 

Actually, you are wrong on that one. Just at the northern side of the wall there is a huge forest and the lands there are actually quite fertile. But, well, since it's so close to the the Wall, no one is using it. North has always suffered shortage of food due to the lack of fertile land, so providing them with more, is not a bad idea. 

The stupidity of the plan is to "build another wall". That's just plain crazy. There is no need for it, and it is not a task that can be done in anything less than a couple of centuries. 
Those wall plans seem like complete madness sometimes, let me guess: he wanted the wildlings to pay for the wall?
I see only ambition and grand designs here, not madness.   

Defense in depth is a  concept that has been implemented   in real life warfare for  two thousand  years or so.    
Additionally, desire to conquer   "unclaimed" lands and bring them under his law   makes a  note that one can easily  imagine  pretty high on (m)any king's thigs-to-do list. Beyond-the-wall  remains the  only corner of continent not under king's rule.  
 
Some few hundred miles north from the wall is hostile, boring glacier on tv only. Books do a great job  describing a thick, unknown  forest of unsettling scale

Building such wall would be a huge effort, maybe Aerys  wanted to drag Starks down by giving them such busy work to last few hundred  years. Certainly building it  would have been mostly an errand for the North. Even matter of honor for Starks, since the current wall was by them, too.


Bran was doing the Time-Warg again in an attempt to further defend the realm.
This makes me wonder about the Bran Stark and Mad King theory.

I thought that it was just a suggestion made by Rickard Stark
I noticed he was a very sad and lonely king.
Aerys II wanted to be remembered.

Building a New Wall would mean he would be immortalized.

Not to mention those regions are very valuable.

The Gift is full of good farmland that is only empty because of the Wildlings. The lands north of the Wall have supplied the Night's Watch with game and timber for centuries without problems.
Aerys claimed he wanted to build a second wall so that he can claim the lands between the first and second wall and extend his realm further North. Aerys had a pretty short attention span and soon grew bored with this idea and moved on to make other promises that will never come true.
Does anyone living then even know how to build a wall of ice?
I think it was Blood Raven, I'm convinced that his meddling is what drove Aerys mad. Blood Raven's attempts to help are what drove Aerys insane. We know that Blood Raven is able to send people dreams and he was possibly telling Aerys to build a new wall. After that didn't work he turned to telling Aerys to burn the Others which Aerys translated into the burning of his perceived enemies.
He was a man of big ambition but no follow through he simply saw the wall and wanted to best it
If he was trying to incorporate the wildlings it might make sense to build a second wall to protect them.
Because he was mad
I always just saw it cycling into mania. His manic phase brought all this grand planning, then he'd cycle back down and forget all about it. Eventually his mania devoted itself entirely to paranoia. 

But you mentioning it followed a visit by Rickard makes me think a bit. His mere presence could've just triggered Aerys, but it's also possible that Rickard made some sort of report to him. I'm just not sure what it would be and why it would matter.

Charming.

Очаровательно :)
haha I liked that you painted the costume on.
Great. This is actually related to halloween and the show. I'm just happy to see something else than standard cosplay.
Nah it means the Throne will likely be destroyed
I always thought it was literal "Snow will fall on kings landing" ... Jon will bring the south down and break the kingdom
I thought it foreshadowed that once the white walkers come to main land/winter comes who sits on the throne won't matter.
I always wondered if it wasn't a misdirect and we're seeing ash falling and not snow? With Dany's dragons, it's a possibility. 
I am getting SICK of seeing these costume posts. We get it, you vape. Can we please go back to discussing posts and tinfoil theories. 
I personally think it's foreshadowing who is going to end up on the throne, what with the Snow and all...
I think it means she will have the Throne, but Snow will fall. That doesn't mean much to her now, but after she falls in love with old Jonny Cakes it might.
Is it snow or ash? The roof of the Throne Room was burned, not blown out. If snow, as others have posted:
1. Danerys Stormborn in the vision doesn't sit on the Throne. She reaches for it and stops.
2. She's taken to the Wall and she walks through a gate.
3. She finds Drogon and their unborn son waiting for her in a yurt.

Dany gets to Westeros, Jon convinces her that the NK, WWs and wights are a real threat more important than the Iron Throne, the same way Melisandre persuaded Stannis, she goes north with her army (minus Dornish and Tyrells who are more interested in killing Lannisters) and dragons to the Wall and stops the NK, WWs and wights, but dies and is reunited with her first love and child in the afterlife.
I don't think it means they win, although I have a feeling it was done that way to make it seem like that's the case.

Winter is here, kings landing will be covered in snow shortly with or without the walkers, but I suspect it will be during danys siege that KL will burn. Either Dany will burn it, or cersie will.
Yes plz stop with the costumes LOL 
About Dany bran and the vision of the throne I can find reason for Dany seeing but bran?  its more complex Unless bran somehow is the one to end it ? I believe there is a connection between night King and bran don't know if it's good or bad.

without him robert and ned may not have won obviously
Jon Arryn had fostered both Robert Baratheon and Ned Stark when both were at a fairly young age. Since Jon at this point had no children Robert and Ned were more or less his surrogate sons much in the same way Jon Snow was like the surrogate son of Jeor Mormont. Anyway after the death of Ned's brother Brandon and father Rickard along with Jon Arryn's nephew(? I think his nephew was friends with Brandon Stark and was kill along with him) and heir, Jon Arryn was given a command from the Mad King Aerys to send him Ned Stark and Robert Baratheon's head. Jon refused and called his banners to go to war against the Targaryens. Besides that when Jon Arryn agreed to marry Lysa Tully he help secure the Riverlands support in the rebellion which would have been critical for them to win the rebellion. After Robert won the rebellion, Jon Arryn was named his Hand of the King and basically ruled the seven kingdoms while Robert drank ate and whored himself into an early grave. By all accounts Jon Arryn was a great man and really helped keep the seven kingdoms in peace which would have been critical especially with a new ruling family in charge. 
He was the first Lord to call his Banners to fight against the Targaryens.

He was a spark.
Big influence. As previous posters have stated, he was instrumental in forming the rebellion against the Mad King. In addition, he was a strong Hand to Robert. He negotiated the marriage to Cersei Lannister, thus securing the wealth and power of Casterly Rock to the new king; he appeased the Martells who were upset with the death of Ellia and her children; and he was the person that Stannis took his suspicions that Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen were the offspring of incest because Stannis knew Robert would listen to Jon.
Was thinking the other mormont! This makes sense! I was so confused for a minute

What's this about Mormount and Jon snow? 
It's a nice tattoo and everything, I like it, but what does dany have to do with the tower of joy?
Fuck haters man, literally every tattoo EVER gets criticism and it's just cause a lotta people are strongly opposed to permanent marks on the body. Hope you like it.
Lol, you got a tattoo of that? 

Man, the detail is nice, but the size and subject matter could've used some better thought process. 
Most GOT tattoos I've seen are too cheerful and sometimes cartoonish...I like how dark it is, especially that dragon
I love the way this tattoo looks. It must have cost a fortune.
I absolutely love this,  very detailed and dark

What the fuck? Why is this a bad tattoo? The work seems pretty good. Is it because Dany and the Tower of Joy are two pretty major parts of the same story but not DIRECTLY related? (as far as we know) It's not like it's a tattoo of Dany and the fucking Millennium Falcon. 
I do like the dragon, a lot. Very much my style of tattoo.
Absolutelly AMAZING. Nice work!!!  
How many sessions?
Pretty good work, faces can come out horrible sometimes haha. 
HEY 911 NOT COOL MAN KEK
It's beautiful and everything but whhhyyyy
No offense but this is an awful tattoo lmao
I actually also found a line in AGOT in which Catelyn thinks to herself that her heart must be turning to stone. That isn't an exact quote, but it's something along those lines.
This might as well be my first post with this new username, but below is one of my favourite quotes from Catelyn at the Eyrie; remembering the story of Alyssa Arryn & her statue (*made of stone*). **Symbolism**.

-

> Alyssa Arryn had seen her husband, her brothers, and all her children slain, and yet in life she had never shed a tear. So in death, the gods had decreed that she would know no rest until her weeping watered the black earth of the Vale, where the men she had loved were buried. Catelyn wondered how large a waterfall her own tears would make when she died.

The black brother is great.
It was meant as a subtle dishonor towards Stannis for allowing Daenerys and Viserys to escape
I wonder how the War of the Five Kings would be different if he had given Stannis Storms End instead of Renly. I don't know if Renly would try to make a claim without being able to summon the banners of Storms End to support it. That would be suicide. Stannis wouldn't have to resort to blood magic that would put off some of his vassals. It would have given Stannis a much stronger unified force to take to Kings Landing. 

It's kind of funny. If Robert did indeed slight Stannis on purpose he would possibly be responsible for ensuring the end of the Baratheon ruling line.
The majority here think that it was a slight by Robert to Stannis for his failure to capture Viserys and Dany, but wasn't that just Stannis' perception? I remember a version where Robert made him Lord of Dragonstone because of its important strategic position in the Blackwater Bay near King's Landing, for he knew Stannis was a superb military commander (also a great fleet commander, which is important here), so he'd rather have Stannis guard his flank from Dragonstone than their green brother Renly.

Or maybe that's just the "official" version that Robert told Stannis, but it's an interesting perspective nonetheless.
It is implied that Robbert and Stannis were not the best of brothers. 
Stannis let Dany and Viserys get away and for it Robert gave Storm's End and Stormland to Renly. Dragonstone to Stannis. Dragonstone was ancestrial place for Targaryens and it's just an island, important but it was as someone said here subtle way of Robert being angry at Stannis. But also they weren't exactly close. But Stannis did his duty.
Robert was a jerk. 
Stannis failed to capture viserys and dany so Robert gave him dragonstone to slight him
The Prince of Dragonstone was historically the Targaryen that was heir to the thrown. I read somewhere, could have just been a theory, that Robert thought of Stannis as the Prince of Dragonstone, as he was the heir at the time. To me that just seems like Robert trying to justify his petty behaviour mentioned in the other comments.

Dragonstone was the Seat of the Heir.

Robert was telling Stannis he was his Heir.
stannis was the heir. the heir got dragonstone. I don't think it was meant as a slight robert just probably didn't think it through 
I think he put Stannis there mostly to help eliminate lingering Targaryen sympathies in the area. That and the petty revenge for the Targaryen heirs escaping. 
Pretty cool that work is ok with you being shirtless. I had to go as Karl Drogo https://i.imgur.com/eZQDWtQ.jpg
I dressed up as Daenerys for work AND NO ONE ELSE IS COSTUMED. It's mortifying.
Nipples at work? That's a bold strategy Cotton.  Let's see if it pays off for him.

So you're playing Ragnar Lothbrok as Drogo
I'm not ready for my coworkers to see my nipples.

Did you seriously shave a nick in your eyebrow?
Something sad about seeing something creative against a dreary, grey cubicle farm backdrop.
The pants and shoes really make this business casual. 
You wearing JNCOs fam?
Funny seeing you on front page this time. Have an upboat!
Please tell me you refused to speak English and showed up to meetings and spoke in Dothraki about how silly it was fighting over point point and shit like that.
My favorite part of your costume is your employee security badge.

That's a great costume, but I have to admit that I clicked because shirtless buff guy. 
Daenerys Targaryen approves
Thought this said my doggo costume and I was very confused.
What does that tattoo say? Something empty is burning...?
The blade wound on your left pec is a nice touch!
That's a pretty good one 
I'm putting together a Drogo cosplay myself, and I'd love to hear what resources you made use of if you have the time to share! (I assume this is something you put together yourself)
This has me dying laughing, just picturing Khal drogo sitting at a desk making an excel spreadsheet or working as a customer service rep answering phones.
Great Value Drogo. 
Reminds me of Ragnar Lothbrok from Vikings : D.
I'd stay away from pillows if I were you... and little blonde girls, too
The infected wound is a great touch!  
The shoes though! lol 
awesome
Very nice costume. Your giving me ragnar lothbrok vibes too.
That wound looks infected...
What does your tattoo say?
You look more badass than Khal whatever in season 6!
nice fucking tits
Lol dude was killed by a pillow
A girl at my work dressed up as John Snow Snow White. She actually pulled it off and looked pretty hot. 
You'd make one good looking Gerald Butler character too
Son of Zorn. It looks like somebody chopped this conference room table with a sword...who could have done this Zorn?
The thumbnail looks like a car sitting on a helmet
I was khal drogo yesterday! Rocked it till morning since today was off! Its the easiest yet most noticeable costumes.

im so [triggered](/t) right now.

have fun with HR you pig!
I was GRRM at work yesterday, where I run a cafe. The customers who recognized GRRM were delighted, while kids and others were a mixture of amused and confused--I tried to make latte art dragons as much as possible. I made a pocket edition of The Winds of Winter, which merely said "They all die" inside. Pinned onto the suspenders were the Targaryen sigil and Dany's dragons, which I got on Etsy from RadisShop (mods, hope it's ok to mention that, otherwise I'm happy to edit it out). Overall it was lots of fun to dress up like someone I truly admire, and hope to use this costume at my next con! 
You're like my second favourite GRRM right now. Great costume.

You may be thinking of Willas Tyrell. From Tywin, in ASOS Tyrion III:

>"'Willas is heir to Highgarden, and by all reports a mild and courtly young man, fond of reading books and looking at the stars. He has a passion for breeding animals as well, and owns the finest hounds, hawks, and horses in the Seven Kingdoms.'"
House Bracken, you know, the ones with a horse on their banner

Weren't the Ryswells mentioned as accomplished horse breeders?
No is the answer. Got my girlfriend the same book and it's completely safe. I think the word adult is whats thrown you off but it just means its colouring for grown ups. Hope she likes it!
no adult themes at all. I've bought a couple of these types of coloring books and it seems like 'Adult' just means that it isn't meant for little kids with developing coordination skills because the pictures can be intricate.

The book is great! I've only done a couple of pages so far, but I'm enjoying it a lot. I bet your friend would love it. :)
Waah, I wanted to color Cersei & Jaime in the Winterfell broken Tower with Bran peeking in!! O.o

im sorta slow?, did the stone contain the poison?, why would the assassination plot require a slick pick pocket move to succeed?
So Olenna picked the poison off Sansa's necklace and then gave it to Littlefinger?? Then how did it get into Joffrey's cup?? I thought Tyrion killed him?? I'm confused.

Game recognize game
I think the Hound is just looking to start a fight, either because he doesn't like Bronn's attitude or on Joffrey's orders. Joffrey ordered Mandon Moore to try to kill Tyrion during the battle, so it makes sense that he'd try to pick off Tyrion's supporters at the same time.
The Hound is a troubled and unhappy individual. He sees Bronn as being a killer no different to himself and despises what he sees as a pretence of being an amiable fun guy. 

He later makes the same comment about Ned. Again I think it's an attempt to justify himself by saying that all men are the same and any other persona (the honourable lord, the caring father) is a pretence. 

The tension also arises from the fact that Sandor doesn't like Tyrion, and Bronn is Tyrion's man.
Watching it in context, it sounds like the Hound was simply having a go at Bronn. The stuff he was saying was based off of what he had observed. Saying that he enjoyed killing was probably a guess, and the part about putting women in the ground just stemmed from the previous statement. 
That scene was mostly to establish Hound as sick of the bullshit. Bronn, while loved here, kills ANYONE for money. 
Brown wasn't currying favor. They were testing each other. Both knew they were headed toward a fight. 
Ha like the hound cares about honor 

"A man has to have a code" maybe it has something to do with that or maybe....her me out maybe he just don't like bronn (I know impossible right)

Here's my daenerys and khal drogo costume!! If you can, please like the picture to help us win a contest  :)
Well from Lyanna and Rheagar's perspective, it wasn't suppose to be a secret for long. Whether they married or not, I believe Lyanna was suppose to return with Rheagar's to King's Landing, else face marriage to Robert Baratheon. It was only the fact that her death was nearing and Rheagar's loss in Robert's Rebellion did she plead with Ned to keep him secret.
There are two possibilities for me.

Ned named him after Jon Arryn

or

Rhaegar/lyanna named him after Jon Connington
They might just replay that scene next season and have her not be muted this time.
Poor Howland.  He never gets a mention.  Am I the only one who sees Lyanna saying that?

Lyanna named her son AEGON but Ned certainly never called him that  to protect him  smart of him,for short called him Jon, makes sense , Jon will learn his real name soon .
Looks like you had fun but your jaime is weak bro.  No gold hand?  No lannister or kingsguard sigil?  I bet that sword isn't even Valyrian steel.

The answer could be quite simple: [Ethan Glover](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ethan_Glover). He and others were with Brandon and Rickard when they went to KL to kill Rhaegar, but he was the only survivor. He was held in the prison until the Lannisters sacked the city and he came free. He accompanied Eddard to Storms End and the Tower of Joy afterwards (and was killed there) and most likely knew it from the mad king himself or a (kings)guard, where Rhaegar had hidden. I wouldn't be surprised if it got mentioned by the mad king while Rickard and Brandon died to increase their pain even more and make them feel more helpless.
Nope, just theories.

No, and I don't think it's something we're every likely to find out. There could be any number of ways that Ned found out where his sister was being kept; all that's important for the story to progress, however, is that he did find out (not how).
Ser Barriston Selmi was badly wounded and captured at the Trident. As a King's Guard, he would have known where Ser Arthur Dayne and his companion(s) had been sent and possibly why. He could have told Ned. With Rhaegar dead, there was no reason to hide her and she would need the protection of her family.
Just happy to see a post that is not cosplay or Halloween related.
They even have a language they can speak (Skroth). If their entire purpose was murder, language seems like a waste of time.
I'm still wondering when crasters baby's become like legit walkers, once they freeze their eyes are they full grown all of the sudden? Does it take 18 years for such a baby to be a white walker? Howw??
They also like to draw that spirally pattern. Granted they draw it with the chopped up limbs of their victims... But it's still kind of culture-y... From the point of view of humankind though, the question of whether or not they have a culture or civilization is irrelevent... What matters is whether or not that culture can co-exist with that of humans and the answer to that appears, so far, to be a big no.
I believe that they have a deeper motive that just destroying humanity. And also, it seems only westeros is under threat from the zambies. 
Just yesterday I noticed for the first time that the [White Walker circle](http://im.ziffdavisinternational.com/ign_za//g/game-of-thrones-5-reasons-why-white-walkers-are-te/game-of-thrones-5-reasons-why-white-walkers-are-te_7xbf.png) and the [COTF stonehenge](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2uiDs.jpg) bear an uncanny resemblance to [the Targaryen sigil](http://www-scf.usc.edu/~annekao/itp104/targaryan.png).

Also, the Night King and Jon Snow are both undead men.
Agree, I think everyone uniting as good vs the bad and evil WW would be too cliché for GRRM (at least in the books).

Yeah, that's how it is in the legends of the books. The show really did not to the WW justice. The Night's King had a Night's Queen who was a true Other, and they fell in love and had a child. They lived in the Nightfort on the wall. There's all kinds of things the show just isn't going to go in to, or has taken creative license with.
I think more will be revealed when we figure out how they were "defeated" following the long night. If they were directly defeated by Azor Ahai and his weapon Lightbringer, then I would say they are merely fueled by revenge/survival. If an agreement was reached, then perhaps things have changed in Westeros or just north of the wall to warrant a new invasion.
The Others/White Walkers are intelligent beings. I believe the fact they're called The Others is proof they really aren't that different from humans. The humans of Planetos only perceive these differences based on something akin to racism. The Others have been shown to have a language of their own and are able to make objects stronger than castle forged steel out of crystal. They are likely much more developed than the people who inhabit Planetos.
The altar and Stonehenge could have been built by someone else. They wore the armor and used weapons that they claimed from the dead and the Night's King wears the armor and uses the weapons that he had with him when he was captured and turned by the Children in the Forest. The non-human weapons they use with the "ice" blades are simplistic, almost Stone Age in appearance. Don't know how riding dead horses implies culture. Intelligent, but not sentient animals can use tactics and tools. Most of what we see implies a less complex society or culture than a "Stone Age" tribe.
I think it's possible that the WW (the Others in the books) were the first indigenous peoples of Westeros even prior to the children of the forest. Since written history has only recorded so far back, who knows what happened prior to man arriving. Maybe they just want their damn land back.
this is the best one ive seen yet today haha.

Who said she was a female White Walker and not a Wight?

Who says that the wards were there at the time?
We're talking about a legend that might not even be halfway true.
Because the nights king is a completely different entity than the Night king. 
A flashback to the tourney at Harrenhal
That and/or more scenes on the white walkers and the "land of always winter"

I feel like the opening scene will mirror something of S01E01 where some members of the nights watch find the wildling corpses and are then confronted by white walkers.

Not that exactly, but I think it will be something a long the lines of that. You cut to some not-regular characters and the white walkers fuck their shit or something. 
I just want it to be the forsaken chapter. Gods that would be a badass, jaw dropping opener
Rhaegar Targaryen 
I think Season 7 is going to run something akin to *Arrow*, with flashbacks interspaced in each (or at least most) episodes, ni order to provide some additional context to non-readers. It makes perfect sense for the series to start at the Tourney at Harrenhal (/u/amazingoopah).

Interesting theory....but Mel already knows they will meet again, so I'm sure she'll have something up her sleeve when it happens.
I'm not so sure arya will still want to kill her anyway.  mel has done many bad things but the show doesn't really portray her as evil, they could team up potentially
I don't think that old women could get far in westeros. She's what? 400 years old? Not exactly capable of taking a leisurely stroll let alone travel the 7 kingdoms.

You think Dany will sacrifice her self to Melisandre? What about the whole Melisandre being the new Nissa Nissa? There has to be a return of lightbringer, right?
I think Dany will more likely be the Nissa Nissa. I'm a show-only so I am not too familiar with the legend. It makes sense to me that Danys life might envoke more magic through sacrifice than Malinsedre's? (Sorry for the poor spelling)
Not necessarily. Tyrion is talking about not wanting to appease one Great Lord because it could cause other Great Lords to start thinking about independence themselves. For the moment the North is a separate entity but that doesn't mean they won't group together in the coming war against the WW. I feel like Jon Snow is being setup as a potential "King who Knelt" and will recognize that the North can't fight WW and dragons together. He will kneel to the Iron Throne to gain dragons to fight the coming WW. Jon Snow seems to know when he is outnumbered and would rather find ways to save lives then throw them away needlessly.

Autonomy within the Seven (now Six) kingdoms is a politically palatable outcome for both Danerys (Jon becomes the second King who Knelt) and for Jon (the Northern Lords are allowed to rule themselves as long as they pay taxes/tribute to King's Landing or Dragonstone.

Upvoting for the awesome grandma!
Posting this on behalf of my sister ( u/blord_88 ) as she can't submit posts yet.
So im confused.  Do you let the kids watch GoT?  Do they know who Jon Snow is?  Or is this just a trend where the parents make the kids dress up as something they find cool?  

I just cant see a 6 year old saying 'I wanna be Jon Snow for halloween!"  How does a 6 year old even know what GoT is?

Light of the Seven (Trial scene)

Though the King of the North and Daenerys's Armada soundtracks are honorable mentions
Always gonna be Rains Of Castamere for me baby
1) The Tower
2) The Children
3) You Are No Son of Mine
4) The Throne is Mine
5) The King's Arrival 
It's a few songs, but I always set it to go The Tower, Winter has Come, Hear Me Roar and The Winds of Winter in order. So really, the last ten minutes of the season 6 finale, just without the dialogue.

Hold the Door and Reign are probably my two favourites by themselves though 
I've always really liked [What Is Dead May Never Die](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niQoEPGvtHk) and [Pay the Iron Price](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzkqA4-4jIM&).
I love "bastard" so much. Such a badass war song that really conveys the chaotic and gruesome nature of war

Characters don't die because they are expendable. We usually decide they were expendable after they die. Robert, Robb, Ned, Jofferey, Jamie's hand... All of these would have had a part to play if they had survived. Other characters seem pointless for ages until they do something significant. Then we think they're gonna die now. But they don't and do something even more significant. Or they actually do die. It's really not that predictable. I think predicting who's going to die or not based on their immediate sense of usefulness for the plot is a bit misguided, and only works in retrospection. 

I personally hope she has more to do. I like where her character is right now.
Don't forget, she has been "tutored" by both Littlefinger and Cersei in how to manipulate the Game of Thrones. Say what you will about either of those characters, but you have to admit that they both are skilled at it.
Didn't Tyrion say that Sansa would survive them all, or something to that affect?   I want Sansa to be the one who brings Littlefinger down.  I don't want her to die.
Maybe not.. i mean she is the only stark female who can be married off to make an army alliance...

Sansa is going to survive till the end, betting my money. She's Switzerland, and will go by relatively unnoticed hile surrounding characters deal with betrayal and death etc.
Sansa's special power is that she's an attractive, hopefully fertile female of a Great House and, therefor, a chess piece in the Game of Thrones. That Jon would never force her into a marriage she didn't want is pretty much taken for granted, but there's her tutelage by Littlefinger and her own ambitions to consider. Given the needs of the Starks, the best candidate is Lord Robert (Robyn) Arryn, which would put the Vale in the North's corner with its 15,000 Knights and its geostrategic location on the north flank of the Crown Lands to neutralize Cersei. Sansa could easily slip into the controlling position like Marjory initially did with Tommen before the High Sparrow got his talons in him and take over from Littlefinger. That would put her into position to manipulate the Council to dismiss him and maybe execute him. Of course, there's the little problem of being married in the eyes of the Faith to Lord Tyrion Lannister. While never consummated, the marriage has not been annulled. Staying married to Tyrion on the other hand, would put Sansa in Danerys' inner circle or at least her court and give her half-brother a voice and eyes and ears near the Stormborn. 
How is she expendable? She is basically the one who save Jon from the battle of the bastards. She might not be a queen, an assassin, or a wizard, but above all else, she is now a formidable player in the Game of Thrones. She was tutored by Littlefinger himself. Who by the way, started all this shit(death of Jon Arryn).

She knows people, might not yet have the proper ways to control them. But she is getting there. At first I personally hate her from the books and the show for being to shallow. But as the story goes. She becomes a badass, little by little.
Sansa could definitely die, I don't think she's going to have anything more to add to the story.

I'm just waiting for the inevitable Snow-Daenerys wedding and cut to credits.
It's a little more straightforward than that. 

Consider this:

>“Old powers waken. Shadows stir. An age of wonder and terror will soon be upon us. **An age for gods and heroes**.”- Leo Tyrell to Pate, AFFC

This quote was interesting and got me thinking what a post-War for Dawn would be like and the kinds of people it will take to rebuild the realm after the dust settles. 

Of the Starks who fit that description: Bran, Arya and Jon should play crucial roles in returning balance to the Raelm. All three have or will be accused of being or acting like Gods. During the War, I think all 3 will play a role in fighting the Long Night and the terror it brings. 

Jon has his ice & fire duties, AA and so on. 

Bran is the Last Greenseer and I think he will use Arya as an instrument, like the Many Faced God would. 

The second group of Stark children:

Robb went South and chose love over his Northern duties and even locked up his direwolf. Sansa is learning Southern politics, prefers the Seven like her mother did. Most importantly, her direwolf is dead. Rickon is Rickon... inconsequential. 
As I was watching the last episode (back when it aired), I knew I needed this dress. So, with time, sewing skills,  and a lot of Googling how to make cosplay armor, this was my end result. 

The shoulders are craft foam, paint, glue, and floor wax. The crown is Sculpey over some wire. I had to paint all the silver dots on, since I couldn't easily find a fabric with the right print at the time.
Looks more like Tommen.

....it's.... still a city. Far away from any characters, even Dany.
Life moved on for Qarth. There's been no need for a character to visit Qarth or update what happened since season 2.
still the greatest city that ever was or ever will be 
incredible
Very not bad!

Now everyone knows you got a blow up sex doll.  

SHAME
SHAME
I was just dressed as the septa. I had fun ringing my bell and shouting shame at people. But I have been outdone.
TIL Gary Oldman does cheap cosplays.
This isn't realistic, there are censor bars.
Whoa that's clever. 
The doll looks a bit like Mr. Bean
Oh man. This is the best one I've seen yet this year. Awesome job!
Couldn't be bothered to make a decent seven pointed star eh? Twelve point star it is. 
Is the mask on it a reference to the bad CGI of Lena Headeys face on the walk?
SHAME
My name is /u/shamebell, and I approved this photo. Great job!
Great job
This got me laughing so hard. 
That's just the perfect costume combo. 
Shame!
Someone should open a Halloween in January store
Yesssssss love this 

Oh my god. This is the most amazing costume ever!
That is the best costume I have seen this season!!!
*ding ding*
Why the censor bars?
The one blow up doll bill won't touch
It is known

Your GF is gorgeous! She does look like Dany.
Hopefully she doesn't have any plans to move to another continent any time soon 
I'm just glad to see a post that isn't another fucking costume
I don't think it is mentioned in the show but Robert had  Targaryen blood so he could make a more legitimate claim to the throne than Jon or Ned.

Given how Ned is portrayed he probably would not want to be king 
Because Roberts grandmother was a targ, and the Baratheons are (believed to be) descended from a targ bastard. So his claim was more legitimate than any other candidate.

Its not much, but you just need something to tip the balance.
John arryn was old and had no heirs.Ned didnt want it.Robert was the only fool who wanted it 
Ned didn't want the power. Even Jamie said he should have taken the seat when he had the chance, but Ned believed Robert had more claim and again really didn't want to be king.
Robbo's got that Targaryen blood in him, just a little bit though 
Robbo's got that Targaryen blood in him, just a little bit though 
Ned walked into the Throne Room and claimed it on behalf of Robert Baratheon. Its really as sinple as that. If he had claimed it for himself nobody would have argued with hjm. It was always going to be either Ned or Robert if they won given their age. Some people say it's because Robert was decendant from the Targaryeans but I don't think that matters one bit. The crown was taken with war, not by blood lines. Plus Ned and Robert so closely aligned it was irrelevant. Compare this rebellion to the War of the 5 Kings where everyone is fighting each other and it might be different. 

I think a more interesting question is if Robert had walked into the Throne Room first would he have claimed it for Ned? Robert obviously didn't have much interest in ruling either. I could absolutely see him doing the same thing Ned did for his friend.

Where's the hammer! Otherwise good job.
Visualization of this [quote](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/55trku/everything_what_did_you_never_realise_until_the/d8el8sd/): "I always thought it was ironic that bran through hodor kills the dude that maimed the guy that crippled him." -  /u/redditorandcheef 
CLEGANEBOWL CONFIRMED.
Everything gets a return 
CRIPPLEBOWL CONFIRMED.
You could've said Bran cripples Hodor
Is it just me or does this not make any sense? Jamie will cripple brann whether or not brann uses hodor to kill Locke. And Locke will cripple Jamie whether or not he was killed by brann

the circle is now complete.
So I guess Jaime paid his debt then. 
Good Guy Bran avenges Jamie.
Doesn't seem much of a Karma loop
Except in the books Locke doesn't exist?

It's actually fairly impressive that they made all the languages morph into Hodor reasonably well.  It was obviously created with English in mind with zero regard for other languages, so yeah I'm pretty impressed by this.

congrats on your dating of Carice van Houten
You can't just post a picture of Mel and claim it's  a costume, that's cheating. 
If your GF starts preaching about the lord of light, is never cold and regularly burns humans then I'd start travelling north of you know what I mean.
Wow. Is your girlfriend single?
This is not a picture of Carice as Mel, it is actually my gf, and yes she looks an insane amount like her!
I came to the comments just to make sure that this wasn't just a joke.  That's uncanny!  I thought it was just a picture of Mel
Welcome to the sub, Guy Pearce!
Wow, even got the pose and downward smirk. Nice work.
You lucky bastard.
I mean wtf this is seriously not Carice Van Houten? Couldn't imagine waking up and realizing my GF looked like season 6 Sansa
Uncanny! And the costume is very well done.

Do you have a picture in which the necklace is more visible? Is such a cool item to pass overlooked!
that's cool, but when she takes that necklace off tho...

Or, better still...
The baby didn't die as she said, she just got rid of him so that her children with Jamie would be the heir's, not a true born son of Robert.
continuing this line of thinking - Gendry says that the only memory he has of his mother is that she had golden hair... like a certain Queen and wife of Robert Baratheron - ergo, he isn't a bastard but actually the rightful heir to the Iron Throne.
Melisandre - "You are more than they could ever be. They are just foot soldiers in the great war. You will make kings rise and fall"

Cersei loves her children "its her one redeeming characteristic" though she may begrudge one by a man she hated, she wouldn't have killed him.
Yes its a show detail only probably as others have mentioned to reinforce that baratheons are black of hair.As in the book someone mentions how if cersei just had 1 of roberts children it would of taken away all accusations about infidelity 
I never really understood why the show did that. There was never any mention of another child in the original story.
In the early part of their marriage Cersei does say she originally had hope for the marriage despite Robert calling her by the wrong name on their wedding night. Hope quickly vanished after that and that's why she started activly aborting robert's children
She was lying.
I dont think so at all.

Cersei multiple times throughout the series is noted as being a loving mother, its her only redeeming quality. I dont think her as a young girl ( as it would only have been a few years after they were married) would kill any child that would be her son. 

Its even noted at one point that cersei did like Robert until she found out he felt no love for her and the relationship did grow stale. "every woman in the seven kingdoms wanted him but he was mine by rights". 

Cersei also explains to Sansa that she may never love Jofferey. But the children she has by him, those she will love. what would that be but a direct case here where she loathed Robert but would have loved the child with everything in her.

While shes probably happy that Joff was in line to be king.. and he was Jamies not Roberts.. She loved him and the others because they were HERS. Any child by robert would have been afforded the same love, if anything she would have loved to have poisoned a true born son of roberts against his father as if to make Robert lose a battle he never knew he was fighting.
Let us say that Gendry is this child. How do you prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt? And who else knows about this? If Gendry was indeed the first born, everyone with any knowledge of his birth, faked death and disposal would have had to been murdered to keep them silent. This would have been a dozen people, at least, all of which would have been missed by some one. We, the viewers know, thanks to Ned, that Gendry is Robert's son. Melisandre has arcane knowledge that Gendry is Robert's son. NO ONE knows who his mother was. There is no way to prove who his mother was. Had anyone else suspected, they would have used Gendry as a rallying point against Geoffrey. Certainly Stannis would have had to back Gendry as the legal heir as his nephew. But none of this happened. To all outward appearances, Gendry is a nameless bastard without family rights, unacknowledged by his father. And Melisandre's prophecies are neither totally accurate or perfect. Also, it doesn't take Gendry being the legal heir to give him the power in some way to make "kings rise and fall". 
This is all good and an interesting theory ...... except. 

Cersei had to have made this all up (for whatever reason) because when a Lord's child is born anywhere, whether it be Kingslanding or Winterfell, they ring the bells all day and night. Catelyn later says that she had no idea about this black-haired beauty which in my opinion would be impossible that she didn't know because word would have spread everywhere that the crowned prince was born. Also Catelyn sister Lysa was in the capital when this supposedly happened.

 Also they commonly have tourneys when a Lord's son is born let alone the prince. Tywin even through a tourney for bum ass Viserys and he didn't even like the Targs at this point. I think he would have done it for his Grandson/Prince. 

Therefore in my opinion she never had a son from Bobby B
Cercie didn't kill Jon tho, it was his crazy wife and littlefinger.

Where did you get the sword from? Looks good!

Maybe people are just calling you inbred. 
[removed]
You look like if Cersei actually had Joffrey with Robert and not just a secret bastard. A legitimate Baratheon-Lannister.
You're also a doppleganger for [Rupert Friend](http://cdn03.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/friend-fandom/rupert-friend-dylan-bruce-ed-skrein-mtv-fandom-awards-02.jpg), but I have a strange feeling a Homeland cosplay wouldn't be very widely recognised.
I see a combination of Jack Gleeson, Joaquin Phoenix and Robert Pattinson.
You lol more like the vampire from twilight imho
You look like an older Joffrey. 
Did they have the costumes then? Looks cool.
When you say official Iron Throne you mean the actual one they use on set?
Dude,you look more like Finn Jones then Jack Gleeson.
You definitely have the look of a Lannister
Gerion Lannister! (Before he went missing!) 
You look like you're related to Michael DeLuise. 

http://giphy.com/gifs/90s-no-michael-deluise-10HUdQa0Rof8uQ
You look like Robert Pattinson and Jack Gleeson had a kid. It's a good thing!
you're right, you do look inbred
You're a Baratheon, the first born son of Robert. Not a Lannister
You look like you're the "real" Joffrey and Jack Gleeson was playing you in the show.

Ah shit, alright, you won Halloween.
Dig if you will a picture, of you and I engaged in a kiss. 
Sweat of your body covers me, can you my darling, can you picture this?
Dream if you can a courtyard, Winter Roses in bloom. 
Animals Strike curious poses, they feel the heat, the heat between me and you.
How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a World that's so Cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other

This is what it sounds like, when Crows Cry
Thomas Jefferson in Hamilton is what came to mind.
How could you just leave me standing, alone on the wall so cold?

Bud Bundy your not fooling anyone
This looks like Mac from /r/IASIP during his big break
I still hold out hope that it is Jaime and Cersei who are Targs, with Tyrion being Tywin's only true son.  

Jaime actually killed his father (Kingslayer, Kinslayer).  Cersei comes by her madness honestly.  Aerys and Cersei should be very similar as father/daughter.
Going through that kind of imprisonment either makes or breaks you. It clearly broke both of them and tore down any remaining walls of sanity they had to grasp onto.
There is not a hint anywhere in the books or show that Cersei and Jaimie were anything but what they appear to be, Tywin's children through Joanna. Given how Tywin treated Tyrion, do you really think he would keep trying to hand Casterly Rock to the son of Aerys II. Or remained the Hand after Jaimie and Cersei were conceived by Aerys raping Joanna? Since that is when it had to happen.
Well, we still have to find out, how mad Cersei actually became. The blow up of the Septa was spectacular, but not particular evil. It was a quick death, none had to suffer and it was for political reasons, not "just for fun". I am excited to see what Cersei truly is now that she is queen.

Actually you can make a lot of references in their characters. They both married someone they didn't love, failed their life goals miserably (Aerys: Become the greatest king ever / Cersei: Make my son(s) king and therefore my family the mightiest in Westeros) and do not trust anyone but the kingsguard and a "scientist" (Qyburn/ Rossart) that provides them with anything they need. Also they both had a person at court they suspected to threat their power (Aerys: Tywin/ Cersei: Margery) and so harmed and insulted them at any given possibility. And they both trust(ed) Jaime Lannister.

The girl in the background... she's either 'miring or judging hard.
Halloween is like Christmas for my eyes.
Not sure who is she playing
You could probably do a great Yara Greyjoy, you look a lot like her

Admittedly that costume would take quite a bit more work

Also, you could totally go as Eowyn next year with that [white-underlayer-with-big-sleeves-and-dark-overlayer-thingy dress](http://i.imgur.com/5fDdKJU.jpg).
nailed it.
Cool idea and looks awesome as well, but now I really want to see a John Snow White Walker.
Awesome costume! Snow Wight would have been cool too. 
Nevermind, this is perfect.

Nothing. Just enjoy it 
I recommend sparing this and other related subreddits, although it is currently flooded by S7 spoilers, cosplays and "I rewatched scene XX, look what i found"-posts. You will be spoilered a lot and GoT is one of the few series where the experience can be totally different when spoilered. It is different like day and night in experience.

Don't expect Tolkien fantasy. Although there are typical fantasy elements, this show is much closer to real social systems and is really well thought in this way. Don't expect a fight good vs. evil. There is more than black or white, there are many grey colors inbetween. 

GoT is full of little details, but you will understand them most likely just later on. 

There are quite a lot of characters, houses and locations to remember, so be ready for that. With the show progressing, this will become easier ;)


Don't worry; all your favorite characters will be just fine.
-If you're coming in new, there are a lot of characters that get introduced and a lot of history between characters that can be confusing in the first season, but don't worry too much about it--it will all come out in the wash. Anything that doesn't, you can make up your own explanations for. You'll just want to remember names and houses, because there are a lot of characters in the show and their loyalties will matter. 

-That the show's costumer is awesome and you should pay attention to and admire her work. As the show progresses each character's wardrobe has it's own story arc, which is neat...if you like clothes or costuming.

-Or maybe look up some of the filming locations after you watch an episode, because there are a lot of amazing locations with a lot of interesting historical stories of their own...if you dig world history.

Expect the unexpected... Other than that sit back and enjoy the ride.
Even though you should already know this, I can't stress it enough, DO NOT LOOK AT ANY SPOILERS! Now sit back, relax and enjoy.

Avoid spoilers at all cost, stay off of everything GoT related until you're caught up.  Prepare for an emotional rollercoaster.
Box of tissues will be needed
Grab a map of "The known world" so you can track whos doing what and where
You know, it's gonna be something else, I can tell you that
just started rewatching the whole show this morning - for like the 10th time but still love ever second of it! also thinking of starting to re-read the books too for the 10th time... to get me through this long Canadian winter
My advice... stay out of this sub until you finish all 6 seasons
Out of curiosity: how much of the story do you know before you start? It seems really hard to begin without being spoiled.

As an advice: pay attention, much and more is important.
I think you looked great!

This was my first time making a costume from craft foam and I think it came out great!  The total cost was about 100-150 dollars. I only bought the craft foam, paint, shirt, toy sword, sword belt, and leather shoelaces.

Goat don't actually eat anything. But they're very curious, have pretty strong stomach, and will take a few bites of anything that seem edible (like cardboard or paper that may look like leaves, or containers that had food in them and thus still somewhat smell  like food) just to taste. I really don't think that a dick would look edible to a goat. 

But Mountain men haven't been shown as particularly bright, so they may just throw the severed dick in the general direction of a goat, but don't stand around to see if it actually eats it, and that somewhat counts as  feeding it to a goat.
Aw, look at him. You can tell that he knows nothing (at least he has the excuse of being a baby). At least he got some love from his own Ghost.

Poor kid, looks too pleasant to be Joffrey
What manner of sorcery conjured that black and white bauble in his right hand? I will not be paying fealty to any king who likes to prance about, shrinking down the horseless carriages, of your world's gold cloaks, so that he may torture them thoroughly! I have never seen such a despicable tyrant!
Must be Robert's own bastard: the seed is strong in this one.
Absolutely not! Way too adorable. How am I suppose to hate Joffrey now? 
So your kid wanted to dress up as Joffrey?
Are you Mike Patton?
Do you live in Texas?
Omg absolutely adorable! 🎃
You're a terrible father.

(Joking. Cute kid and awesome costume)
That's just cruel
Nice costume. Cute Kid. Beautiful home.
That's John Mayer you fucker
What is he holding?

Is that a tiny Elsa I see in the background? 
Well that's ONE way to tell your parents that you knocked up your sister.
With kings landing in the back
Why is a stark helping king joffrey?
3/10 face not purple.

Nice one.  

And the cop car ;-) 
 What were they out of Hilter costumes for your kid? 
Savage.
You don't think much of your son do you? :P

Nice costume though :D
I have to say that basing your child's costume off a sadistic and violent king who has people beheaded also of whom is which is featured in a explicit tv show isn't the best no matter how cute it is.
Why would your son want to be a dickhead? I'm gonna kick your son in the ribs

Given that Joffrey's blond hair was a big plot point, I have to admit this is disappointing.

Taste amazing and leave a golden lipstick 😂
The fact that when you click to preview, everything is blurred, makes it so much better
Loose seal! Loose seal!
So that's what the Bolton men did with Jaime's hand.
Those Spaniards are clever. You really gotta hand it to them.

Silent duck
Does that mean that when Jaime Lannister got back to Kings Landing, all Tywin did was buy him some ice cream? 
Hey! I live in Barcelona, where'd you get this from?
Isn't that Maradona's hand?
Oh yeah, well in Antwerp, you can get tiny Jamie hands

It took me way too long to realize why there was no head.... Great costume!
No head: 10/10

I seriously saw this and for an instant thought, "but where the hell is his head". I'm an idiot.
Poor old dead Ned
The jeans and boots really tie it all together! :)
