HAVING POSTED A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO ON THE DOUBLE SLIT EXPERIMENT WHICH IS WEIRD I WAS POSTED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE DELAYED QUANTUM ERASER EXPERIMENT WHICH IS EVEN WORSE BUT SO INTERESTING

SO IT GOT ME WONDERING WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU MODIFIED THE EXPERIMENT A LITTLE BACKGROUND BY THE WAY IS IN BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES MY PHYSICS IS HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL AND THE VIDEO REFERENCE IS WITH THE EXPERIMENT DESCRIBED AROUND MINUTE MARK

OK SO YOU FIRE A PARTICLE FROM THE BEAM ITS SPLIT INTO TWO BY THE FIRST PRISM AND ONE LANDS AT DETECTOR LETS SAY YOU DON'T GET ANY SIGNAL REGISTERED AT EITHER OR AND ITS HEADING TO THE THIRD MIRROR BSC

AT PRESENT YOU'D SAY THE PARTICLE WOULD PRODUCE AN INTERFERENCE PATTERN IT'S ALREADY LANDED AT SO CAN'T CHANGE WHERE IT TURNS UP SO WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU TAKE AWAY THE MIRROR BSC AFTER THE PARTICLE HAS BEEN DETECTED AT YOU COULD EASILY STICK THE LAST PART OF THE APPARATUS ON THE MOON LIGHT SECONDS AWAY YOU'D THEN KNOW WHICH SLIT THE ORIGINAL FATHER OF THE ENTANGLED TWIN PARTICLES WENT THROUGH BUT IT'D BE TOO LATE TO COLLAPSE THE INTERFERENCE PATTERN

EQUALLY IF YOU REFRAINED FROM MEDDLING WITH THE EXPERIMENT BUT PUT ALL OF THE BOTTOM HALF OF THE EXPERIMENT ON THE MOON AND FIRED OUT A PARTICLE AT INTERVALS WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO TELL IN ADVANCE THE BEHAVIOR OF EACH MOONBOUND PARTICLE AT THE FIRST SPLITTER BASED ON THE SIGNAL DETECTED AT FROM ITS TWIN BEFORE THE SECONDS IT TOOK TO GET THERE AND LAND AT 2 OR IF IT LANDED IN AN INTERFERENCE PATTERN DOES THAT MEAN SOMEHOW IT ALREADY KNOWS ITS TWINNED PARTNER IS GOING TO PASS THROUGH THE FIRST SPLITTER WHEN IT EVENTUALLY ARRIVES THERE
DELETED
IMAGINE A ROOM THAT'S CIRCULAR THE WALLS HAVING COPPER WIRING LIKE AN ALTERNATOR AND THERE IS A SPINNING HORIZONTAL ROD IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM WITH A MAGNET ON EITHER END WOULD THIS GENERATE ELECTRICITY
THIS SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY BOLD CLAIM BACKED UP BY NOT THE MOST EVIDENCE U VERYLITTLE U ROBUSETCELERITAS IS THIS REASONABLE

ALSO WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON IN THAT FIGURE
ANY NUCLEAR PHYSICISTS CARE TO COMMENT ON THIS TRIPLE NUCLEAR COLLISION SEEMS LIKE A BIT OF A STRETCH TO ME BUT I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH TO REALLY COMMENT

ALSO COULDN'T THIS BE FAIRLY EASILY TESTED IN AN ANVIL CELL
LET'S NOT FORGET THAT THIS IS THE JOURNAL WHICH RECENTLY PUBLISHED A PAPER ARGUING AGAINST ACCELERATED COSMIC EXPANSION NOT EXACTLY SURE WHERE NATURE SCIENTIFIC REPORTS ARE GOING BUT THE GENERAL DIRECTION SEEMS TO BE AGAINST ACCEPTED WISDOM AND IN THE CASE OF COSMIC EXPANSION AGAINST MOST OF THE DATA DON'T KNOW ENOUGH TO MAKE THE SAME ATTACK AGAINST THIS PAPER THOUGH
I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT U GREBO THINKS AS WELL
ALVEREZ AND JONES FINALLY GETTING SOME VERIFICATION AFTER THE COLD FUSION FIASCO BY THE TWO WHO SHALL NOT BE NAMED
CAN I HAVE ONE
IN THE FACILITY WAS MODIFIED TO INCLUDE A CATAPULT LAUNCH WITH AN INITIAL SPEED OF KM H GIVING IT TWICE THE FREEFALL TIME BUT MAKING THE FACILITY AT LEAST EIGHT TIMES AS COOL

WE'RE DEFINITELY THE TARGET AUDIENCE FOR THIS ARTICLE HERE FULLY AGREE WITH THAT SENTENCE
BUT CAN IT LAUNCH A PROJECTILE OVER METERS ONLY A TREBUCHET CAN DO THAT
MY FATHER USED TO WORK FOR ESA IN BREMEN IN THE AND DID SOME WORK AT THAT TOWER THOUGH AS AN ENGINEER NOT REALLY FOCUSING ON THE PHYSICS ASPECT OF THE FACILITY
WHY THE CATAPULT WHY DON'T THEY HAVE A LIFT THAT JUST DROPS THE EXPERIMENT FROM THE TOP
GRAD STUDENT IN EXPERIMENT HERE

THERE ARE SOME DAYS WHEN I'M AT MY COMPUTER ALL DAY AND SOME WHERE I'M NOT SITTING AT MY DESK FOR A SINGLE MINUTE

LOTS OF PROGRAMMING FOR DATA ANALYSIS AND SIMULATIONS I HAVE TO KNOW SOME NUCLEAR PHYSICS OBVIOUSLY SOME ELECTRONICS SOME STATISTICS DATA ANALYSIS SOME ACCELERATOR BEAM PHYSICS SOME DETECTOR PHYSICS ETC

I DO MY ANALYSIS IN ROOT AND MOST SIMULATIONS IN BEANT IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THEM

SO WHEN I'M NOT AT THE COMPUTER DOING ANALYSIS I'M MESSING AROUND WITH DETECTORS ELECTRONICS CRYOGENICS THINGS LIKE THAT

IT'S S LOT OF FUN I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN ALL THE THEORY ESPECIALLY NUCLEAR THEORY OF COURSE BUT I LIKE TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO GET MY HANDS DIRTY TOO I LIKE THE BALANCE A LOT I THINK EXPERIMENTAL NUCLEAR PHYSICS HAS A VERY BRIGHT HORIZON IT'S A GOOD FIELD TO GET INTO IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS
U ROBUSETCELERITAS GIVES A PRETTY GOOD OVERVIEW OF EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS WHAT TENDS TO VARY IS THE BALANCE AMONG THE DIFFERENT TOPICS I SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON ANALYSIS AND SIMULATIONS WITH LITTLE HANDS ON TIME AND I'VE GOT COLLEAGUES THAT HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT BALANCE OF THOSE THINGS
PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS U ROBUSETCELERITAS WITH EVEN LESS FOCUS ON ACTUALLY TINKERING WITH DETECTORS SINCE I'M PART OF A LARGE COLLABORATION FOR STUFF RELATED TO THE DETECTOR I USUALLY CHANGE FIX SOFTWARE NEEDED TO CORRECTLY USE RAW DATA
NEEDLESS TO SAY
NOT QUITE WHILE MANY OF US HAVE INDEED HAD THOSE STRUGGLES IT NEVER GOES WITHOUT SAYING

ANYWAY I WOULD SUGGEST TO TAKE A BREAK AND LET YOURSELF COOL DOWN FOR A BIT MIGHT BE A DAY OR TWO MIGHT BE A SEMESTER OR MORE THAT'S OKAY BUT USE THAT TIME TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND YOURSELF AND WHAT IT IS THAT GOT YOU SO WORKED UP AND ANSWERING THAT QUESTION WITH PHYSICS IS A BIT OF A COP OUT THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF CONTRIBUTING TO THE DIFFICULTY WHETHER YOU ARE WILLING TO ADMIT IT OR NOT
OFFICE HOURS AND STUDY GROUPS
PHYSICS CLASS DEFINITELY TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO I HAD THE BENEFIT OF TAKING INTRO PHYSICS A FEW TIMES IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE IT WAS OVERWHELMING AND I HAD TO DROP IT AT LEAST ONCE AND THEN ANOTHER TIME I RETOOK IT AND GOT A C ONLY BECAUSE OF SOME GENEROUS CURVING BY THE PROFESSOR AND IN THAT TIME I'VE SEEN A LOT OF A STUDENTS GOING THROUGH THE SAME THING DESPITE PUTTING IN TWICE AS MUCH TIME FOR THE CLASS AS THEY WERE FOR ANY OTHER

WE GET THESE QUESTIONS FAIRLY FREQUENTLY SO INSTEAD OF TYPING EVERYTHING OUT AGAIN READ MY COMMENT HERE ON SUGGESTIONS FOR HOW TO GET THROUGH IT A BIT EASIER
GET THE STREETWISE GUIDE TO CALCULUS REMEMBER CALC ORIGINATED FROM PHYSICS TO DESCRIBE NATURAL PHENOMENA REALLY TRY TO UNDERSTAND CALCULUS CONCEPTS ON A FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL I E WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO TAKE A DERIVATIVE HOW CAN YOU DERIVE KINEMATICS EQUATIONS ETC
THIS GUY GOT INTERNET STRANGERS TO GIVE HIM DOLLARS TO WORK ON QUANTUM GRAVITY PROBLEMS THAT'S AMAZING
LINK TO THE PAPER
REMINDME IN YEARS CHECK WIKIPEDIA IF IS BHD GRAVITY STILL A THING
FROM THE LINKED POST

WHAT I FIND PARTICULARLY INTERESTING ABOUT THIS IS THAT WITH A THEORY BASED ON THE BHD ALGEBRA WE DO NOT APPEAR TO LEARN ANYTHING OF EXISTENTIAL SIGNIFICANCE STEPHEN HAWKING TALKS ABOUT KNOWING THE MIND OF GOD AS A SPIN-OFF FROM A FINAL THEORY BUT IF NATURE SHOULD HAVE CHOSEN A THEORY BASED ON THE BHD ALGEBRA THEN THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE ANY MESSAGE DIVINE OR SECULAR TO BE FOUND IN IT BUT RATHER AN AWKWARD SENSE OF THE TRIVIAL NO DEEP REVELATIONS ABOUT REALITY NO SUPERSYMMETRY NO EXTRA DIMENSION AND NO EVERYTHING IS MADE OF TINY BANANAS AN ALGEBRA THAT SIMPLY ENCODES HOW STUFF IS MOVED AROUND IN SPACE IS SOMETHING SO ORDINARY THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN DOWN AGES AGO AND DOES NOT SEEM QUITE WORTH THE STRUGGLE OF FINDING IT THIS IS PRECISELY THE REASON I BELIEVE THAT THIS WOULD BE A MOST INTERESTING FINALE TO THAT SCIENTIFIC QUEST WHICH THE ANCIENT GREEKS STARTED SEVERAL MILLENNIA AGO

REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THIS PARTICULAR THEORY IS CORRECT I THINK THIS IS AN INTERESTING COMMENT REGARDLESS IT'S MORE THAN LIKELY THAT A UNIFIED THEORY WILL BE HEAVILY MATHEMATICALLY BASED

I MEAN WHAT EXACTLY DO WE EXPECT TO FIND FROM SUCH A THEORY IS IT THE EXPECTATION OR HOPE OF SOME GRAND REVELATION OR SIMPLY THE AMBITION TO FULLY DESCRIBE THE LAWS OF NATURE FOR THE SAKE OF THE ENDEAVOUR ITSELF

PERHAPS WAY WAY LATER DOWN THE LINE WE CAN FIND PRACTICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PREDICTIONS FROM SUCH A THEORY
SO R PHYSICS IS THIS A MEME OR NOT

I JUST REALLY LIKE THEORETICAL PHYSICS BUT I GUESS NOT SO MUCH THAT I'D BE WILLING TO STUDY IT FOR YEARS TO COMPREHEND THE DETAILS OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS ANY PHYSICS GODS ON THIS SUB CARE TO ENLIGHTEN US DUMBASS LAYMEN LURKERS
OK UNDERGRAD INTERESTED IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS HERE I AM CURRENTLY DOING AN ADVANCED QM COURSE AT MY UNIVERSITY AND HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE BASICS OF ALGEBRAS AND SPECIAL RELATIVITY

BEFORE I DIG IN TWO QUESTIONS

WHAT MORE PREREQUISITES DO I NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE PAPER

2 HOW BIG OF A DEAL WOULD THIS BE IF THEIR THEORY TURNS OUT TO BE CORRECT CONSISTENT WITH OBSERVATIONS
EMPTY IS RIGHT THIS SOUNDS LIKE A NICE FRAMEWORK BUT ONE THAT IS COMPLETELY LACKING IN PREDICTIVE POWER IT SEEMS LIKE ALL THEY'RE DOING IS RECASTING REGULAR EFTS GRAVITY AS A SINGLE THING WITHOUT CONTRIBUTING ANYTHING TO WHAT THOSE REGULAR EFTS SHOULD LOOK LIKE IF IT CONTAINS THE STANDARD MODEL THAT'S COOL BUT UNLESS IT ALSO DEMANDS THE EXISTENCE OF A FIXION I'LL STICK WITH THE TIME-HONORED THROW SHIT AT A WALL AND SEE WHAT STICKS METHOD OF DEVELOPING THEORIES
OUR ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT SUCH A THEORY EXIST

AN ALGEBRA THAT SIMPLY ENCODES HOW STUFF IS MOVED AROUND IN SPACE IS SOMETHING SO ORDINARY THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN DOWN AGES AGO AND DOES NOT SEEM QUITE WORTH THE STRUGGLE OF FINDING IT

DOES THE ANALYSIS SUGGEST PRETTY STRONGLY ARE THEY JUST BEING HUMBLE OR ARE THEY NOT QUITE SURE OF THEIR CONCLUSIONS YET
1ST YEAR SECOND SEMESTER PHYSICS MAN HERE
WHAT DOES X DENOTE IN THIS SITUATION JUST GOT DONE LEARNING MAGNETISM NOW GETTING INTO OF ELECTRICAL FIELDS
I KNOW E X IS A EXPONENTIAL FUNCTION AND ALSO THE INVERSE OF LN X
BUT WHAT IS UPPERCASE X ROMAN NUMERAL FOR THE NUMBER TEN I HYPOTHESIS NAAMAN IF YOU COULD DO THOSE TPS REPORTS THAT'D BE GREAT

NICE

NEXT ON THE THEORY CHECK LIST ARE PREDICTION EXPERIMENT DISCOVERY AND REPEAT

LET US KNOW IF YOU NEED HELP I MAY NEED TO BRUSH UP ON ALGEBRA FIRST

I REALLY DESPISE ALL OF THESE THEORY OF EVERYTHING CROWDFUNDING BULLSHIT IF YOU WANT TO CONTRIBUTE TO FUNDAMENTAL THEORETICAL PHYSICS THEN STUDY WORK OUT YOUR SHIT PUBLISH AND SHUT UP ABOUT YOURSELF LIKE EVERYONE ELSE HAS DONE SINCE THEORETICAL PHYSICS EXISTS YES THE GIANTS TOO
AS A THEORETICAL PHYSICS PHD STUDENT NEAR THE END OF MY DEGREE I CAN TRY AND WRITE SOMETHING RELEVANT I'M DOING PEN AND PAPER HIGH ENERGY THEORY SOMETHING QUITE CLOSE TO PURE MATHEMATICS THE WORK IS A MIX OF READING THE RELEVANT LITERATURE SOME COMPUTATION TRYING TO SOLVE THE VARIOUS PROBLEMS THAT INVARIABLE ARISE AND DISCUSSIONS WITH AND ADVISOR WHEN YOU MORE OR LESS UNDERSTAND ENOUGH FOR AN ARTICLE YOU GO THROUGH THE PAINFUL WORK OF WRITING A DRAFT USUALLY DURING THIS WORK YOU FIND A FEW THINGS YOU ACTUALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND SO MORE PROBLEM SOLVING IS USUALLY REQUIRED ONCE YOU HAVE A DRAFT YOU REWRITE AND POLISH IT FOR A WHILE BEFORE SUBMITTING TO ARXIV AND SOME JOURNAL THEN YOU START THINKING MORE ABOUT THE NEXT PROJECT AND THE PROCESS REPEAT


PERSONALLY BECAUSE OF THE SUBJECTS I'VE WORKED ON I'VE NEEDED A FAIR BIT OF SPECIALIZED MATHEMATICS HOWEVER EVEN FOR PEOPLE DOING HIGH ENERGY THEORY THIS CAN VARY QUITE A LOT MANY MOST PEOPLE DON'T NEED THAT MUCH MATH BUT THEY MIGHT NEED SOME VERY ADVANCED COMPUTATIONAL TECHNIQUES ALSO I'VE DONE ZERO CODING DURING MY PHD AT MOST I'VE USED MATHEMATIC TO DO SOME LONGER ALGEBRAIC COMPUTATIONS BUT AGAIN THIS VARIES SOME OF MY OFFICE MATES COMPLAIN THAT ALL THEY DO IS WRITE CODE


FOR ME THE WORK HAS BEEN INTERESTING AND STIMULATING THERE'S BEEN PERIODS OF INTENSE WORK WHEN FINISHING PROJECTS AND WHEN THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION GOING ON BUT ALSO PERIODS WITH CONSIDERABLY LESS WORK WHEN YOU'RE SORT OF STUCK WHEN STARTING A NEW PROJECT OR WHEN ALL YOUR ARE AWAY ABOUT CHANGING TO EXPERIMENTAL FOR ME THAT REALLY DOESN'T FEEL FEASIBLE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN ANY SORT OF EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS AND HIGH ENERGY THEORY IS JUST WAY TOO BIG IN GENERAL I THINK IT'S VERY HARD TO MAKE ANY SUCH LARGE SWITCH AFTER FINISHING A PHD IF YOU'RE HIRING POSTDOCS WHY WOULD YOU EVER HIRE A THEORY PERSON WHEN THERE'S PROBABLY A LARGE NUMBER OF MORE QUALIFIED EXPERIMENTALISTS APPLYING FOR THE SAME POSITION SAME THING GOES THE OTHER WAY AROUND AS WELL WHEN DOING RESEARCH YOU'RE USUALLY VERY SPECIALIZED EVEN SWITCHING FROM SAY HIGH ENERGY THEORY TO PARTICLE PHYSICS THEORY WHICH TO PROBABLY SOUND LIKE EXACTLY THE SAME THING IS PROBABLY NOT TOO EASY DEPENDING ON WHAT EXACTLY YOU'VE DONE
AN ELECTRON HAS A RELATIVELY SHORT MEAN FREE PATH IN AIR AT STP I CAN'T REMEMBER OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT LESS THAN A FEW CENTIMETERS ANY PHOTOGRAPHY WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE IN A VACUUM CHAMBER WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY A TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPE OPERATES AT HIGH VACUUM MAGNETIC FIELDS ARE USED AS LENSES TO FOCUS THE ELECTRON BEAM AND IN SOME CASES RASTER IT BACK AND FORTH IT ISN'T EXACTLY LIKE SCHLIEREN PHOTOGRAPHY BUT EMS CAN DO LIGHT FIELD AND DARK FIELD IMAGING
THE PRINCIPLE OF ELECTRON PATHS BENDING IN ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS IS HOW OLD CRT TVS AND OSCILLOSCOPES WORK AN ELECTRON BEAM IS DEFLECTED BY A CONTROLLED ELECTRIC FIELD TO HIT A PARTICULAR POINT ON A SCREEN WHERE A PHOSPHOR LIGHTS UP

ON A COLOR TV WITH A SHADOW MASK ACTING AS A GRID MAGNETIC FIELDS CAN PRODUCE EFFECTS

WHY DO WE USE THE LAGRANGIAN TRY WORKING IT OUT WITH LAWS NO PEEKING AT YOUR LAGRANGIAN EQUATION OF MOTION

LAGRANGIAN ARE MUCH NICER BECAUSE THEY'RE SCALARS WHILE FORCES ARE VECTORS AND LAGRANGIAN USE GENERALIZED COORDINATES WHEREAS FORCES HAVE UGLY TRANSFORMATION LAWS BETWEEN COORDINATE SYSTEMS AND THEY'RE ONLY STRAIGHTFORWARD BETWEEN SIMPLE COORDINATE SYSTEMS CARTESIAN SPHERICAL CYLINDRICAL AND A FEW OTHERS
WHAT IS IMPULSE BASED SIMULATION I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT BUT I CAN INFER WHAT IS GOING ON HERE WHAT HAPPENS IN STUDYING CHAOTIC SYSTEMS IS THAT WE WANT TO STUDY DIRECTLY THE EQUATIONS OF MOTIONS BECAUSE WE CAN CONTROL THE PARAMETERS TO UNDERSTAND HOW CHAOTIC BEHAVIOUR ARISES IT IS NOT ABOUT SEEING SUCH BEHAVIOUR BUT ACTUALLY MEASURING STUFF AND FOR THAT YOU NEED TO WORK WITH THE ACTUAL EQUATIONS FOR INSTANCE YOU MIGHT CHECK IF A PARAMETER CAUSES BIFURCATIONS AND OF WHICH KIND CALCULATE THE LYAPUNOV EXPONENT OR CHECK HOW THE ORBITS ARE DEFORMED BY THE NONLINEAR PERTURBATION SEE KAM THEORY

THERE IS ALSO THE FACT THAT WE CAN CHECK HOW PRECISE THE ACTUAL ALGORITHM FOR THE SOLUTION OF THE EQUATION A BIG PROBLEM IN NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS IS AS YOU'VE SAID THAT FIDDLING WITH THE TIME STEP RESULTS IN DIFFERENT BEHAVIOUR THAT SHOULDN'T BE THE CASE WE TRUST THE MATH AND THE SIMULATIONS MUST BE INDEPENDENT OF TIME STEPS OR AT LEAST CONVERGE TO AN EXACT SOLUTION THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO CHECK IF THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE SIMULATION HAS THE SAME STRUCTURE AS THE ANALYTICAL SOLUTIONS IN MECHANICS YOU WOULD CHECK FOR EXAMPLE ENERGY OR MOMENTUM CONSERVATION DEPENDING ON YOUR PROBLEM THIS IS WHY THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO SOLVE NUMERICAL EQUATIONS IDEALLY EVERY SINGLE ALGORITHM SHOULD GIVE THE SAME SOLUTION BUT WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS IS THAT SOME ALGORITHMS ARE BETTER FOR SPECIFIC KINDS OF PROBLEMS

NOT JUST EUROCENTRIC

YOU MAY BE SOL THERE UNLESS YOU DON'T CONSIDER THE SOVIET UNION PART OF EUROCENTRISM YOU PRETTY MUCH ARE LIMITED TO JAPAN POST WW2 AND INDIA UP UNTIL QUITE RECENTLY FOR JAPAN THE KAMIOKANDE NEUTRINO DETECTOR MAYBE

SK GALLERY OME

THOUGH THAT WAS ONLY BUILT IN THE THE FIRST JAPANESE NOBEL PRIZE WINNER WAS YUKAWA IN

WIKI

FOR INDIA RAMAN WON IT IN

WIKI COUNTY

THERE ARE ALSO PEOPLE LIKE YANG AND LEE WHO WERE CHINESE BUT DID THEIR WORK AT AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES TOMONAGA WON THE NOBEL ALONG WITH FEYNMAN

JR GIF PHYS

ACTUALLY AS I'VE SAID OTHER THAN JAPAN INDIA INCLUDING PAKISTAN AS THEY WERE UNITED WHEN MANY LAUREATES WERE BORN AND CHINESE WORKING IN THE US THERE'S NEVER BEEN A NON EUROCENTRIC NOBEL PRIZE WINNER IN PHYSICS AT LEAST NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE

EDIT IF BY NON EUROCENTRIC YOU ALSO JUST MEAN NOT MEN THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF WOMEN WHO HAVE MADE GREAT CONTRIBUTIONS TO PHYSICS IN ITS HISTORY SUCH AS I'M SETTING A TIME CUT-OFF AT ABOUT THE OBVIOUSLY IN THE MODERN PHYSICS WORLD THERE ARE MANY MANY WOMEN DOING GREAT THINGS CURIE WHO YOU ALREADY SAID LISE MEITNER EMMY NAETHER MARIA WU

YOU COULD ALSO DO THE SOMEWHAT CONTROVERSIAL PRACTICE OF PUTTING EXTREME EMPHASIS ON OBJECTIVELY NOT VERY IMPORTANT SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTIONS MADE BY A NUMBER OF WOMEN THROUGHOUT THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE DONE BY WOMEN SAYING IT THAT WAY MAKES IT SOUND LIKE I'M BEING REALLY NEGATIVE ABOUT THIS APPROACH WHICH ISN'T REALLY THE CASE BUT IF YOU WANT TO DO THAT YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND YOU'LL HAVE TO PLAY A BIT OF REVISIONIST HISTORY FOR HOW CRUCIAL SOME OF THESE CONTRIBUTIONS WERE LIKE EXPLAINING HOW IT WAS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT THAT SHE TRANSLATED THE MANUSCRIPT OF SOME WHITE DUDE MATHEMATICIAN INTO ITALIAN AND EVEN ADDED AN APPENDIX AND WHY YOU'RE FOCUSING ON HER IF THE WORK WAS SO IMPORTANT RATHER THAN THE PERSON WHO ACTUALLY WROTE THE MANUSCRIPT TO THIS END THE USUAL LIST OF WHICH I'M SURE YOU CAN FIND PICTURES IS PEOPLE LIKE ADA LOVELACE MARIE ANNE LAVOISIER HENRIETTA LEAVITT EMILIE DU CHATELIETE GRACE HOPPER VERA RUBEN

NOT SAYING THESE PEOPLE DIDN'T DO AMAZING THINGS OH I CAN JUST SMELL THE DOWNVOTES A COMING BUT OBJECTIVELY IF THEY HADN'T BEEN WOMEN THERE WOULD BE NO WAY YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD OF ANY OF THEM AGAIN I'M JUST SAYING THIS TO BE CLEAR THAT IF YOU GO THAT ROUTE YOUR STUDENTS MAY QUESTION THE SIGNFICANCE OF THE WORK


GOTTA HAVE FEYNMAN
I THINK THE CURRENT WAR BETWEEN ALTERNATING CURRENT VS DIRECT CURRENT IS A REALLY INTERESTING PART PHYSICS IN HISTORY THE POLITICS INVOLVING IT AND THE CREATION OF THE FIRST EVER ELECTRIC CHAIR IS REALLY INTRIGUING
OF COURSE I AM IN GRADUATE SCHOOL BUT I WORK WITH A COMPANY THAT HAS SEVERAL SCIENTISTS DOING R D INTO X-RAY OPTICS IT IS VERY APPLIED PHYSICS BUT PHYSICS NONETHELESS

MANY LARGE CORPORATIONS HIRE PHYSICISTS IN A CAPACITY WHERE THEIR DEGREE IS USED SOME EXAMPLES IBM INTEL BOEING RAYTHEON MICRON HONEYWELL BAE SYSTEMS AND MANY OTHERS A LARGER LIST IS HERE BUT SOME OF THOSE ARE FINANCE AND OTHER JOBS
DAVID PROBLEMS ARE QUITE DIFFICULT I RECOMMEND WORKING IN GROUPS AND YOU'LL PROBABLY WANT TO SPEND HOURS ON EACH ONE AND CHECK SOLUTIONS ONLY WHEN YOU'RE DONE
IF IT'S A STARRED PROBLEM I WOULD ABSOLUTELY TRY TO SOLVE IT BUT JUST REMEMBER THAT THEY ARE PRETTY DIFFICULT AND USUALLY REQUIRE VERY SPECIAL INSIGHTS AND YOU COULD SPEND WEEKS ON IT AND NEVER GET IT

THAT SAID YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET MOST OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS BUT YOU WOULD REALLY BENEFIT FROM WORKING ON THEM WITH CLASSMATES I SPENT SEVERAL HOURS ON MY WEEKLY PROBLEM SETS WHEN USING THIS BOOK AND THAT WAS WHILE COLLABORATING WITH CLASSMATES

ALSO HIS TIME DILATION LIMERICKS ARE GREAT

THE EFFECTS OF DILATION OF TIME

ARE MAGICAL STRANGE AND SUBLIME

IN YOUR FRAME THIS VERSE

WHICH YOU'LL SEE IS NOT TERSE

CAN BE READ IN THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES SOMEONE ELSE IN ANOTHER FRAME TO READ A SIMILAR SORT OF RHYME
AS A RULE OF THUMB YOU SHOULD NEVER CHECK FOR SOLUTIONS EVEN ONE OR TWO LINES OF COURSE IF YOU ARE STUDYING ON YOUR OWN AND HAVE NO PEERS NO TEACHERS OR NO TAS THINGS ARE DIFFERENT

THE PROBLEM WITH LOOKING AT JUST ONE OR TWO LINES IN THE SOLUTION MANUAL IS THAT YOU'LL USUALLY CHECK THE FIRST LINES WHERE ALL THE PHYSICS IS THE REST OF THE PROBLEM IS USUALLY JUST MATH THAT YOU CAN DO BY YOURSELF

AT THE VERY LEAST TRY SOMETHING WRITE SOMETHING DOWN TRY TO DEVELOP YOUR INTUITION THEN CHECK THE SOLUTION AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU DID WRONG AND WHY HE DID WHAT HE DID
IF YOURE TRYING TO SOLVE THESE WITH HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL KNOWLEDGE THAT IS IMPRESSIVE IT IS A GREAT BOOK THAT TEACHES PROBLEM SOLVING AT THE OLYMPIAD LEVEL WITH A GOOD AMOUNT OF MATHEMATICAL SOPHISTICATION DO NOT EXPECT TO SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS IN THE BOOK ON YOUR OWN BUT DONT BE DAUNTED TO KNOW THAT SOME MAY TAKE DAYS OF THINKING ON YOUR OWN UNTIL IT FINALLY CLICKS MY ADVICE IS TO WORK THROUGH THEM AND NOTE THE ONES YOU GET STUCK ON AND SKIP THEM COME BACK TO THEM LATER WHEN YOURE DONE THE CHAPTER REST OF THE PROBLEMS

HAVE FUN ITS AN EXCELLENT BOOK WHICH CAN BE A BETTER TEACHER THAN ANY OTHER PROFESSOR
MORIN WAS USED AS THE TEXT FOR MY UNDERGRAD COURSE IN CLASSICAL MECHANICS AFTER HAVING USED KNIGHT TO COVER A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING IN FIRST YEAR

OUR PROFESSOR WARNED US THAT THE PROBLEMS IN THE BOOK WERE QUITE CHALLENGING ESPECIALLY THE THREE AND FOUR STAR PROBLEMS SHE ADVISED US THAT THE AVERAGE PROBLEM SET QUESTION WAS EQUIVALENT TO A TWO STAR PROBLEM AND THAT WE COULD EXPECT TO SPEND A COUPLE OF HOURS ON SUCH A PROBLEM AND THAT THE MIDTERM AND EXAM WOULD BE MOSTLY ONE STAR PROBLEMS WITH A TWO STAR PROBLEM WHICH WE HAD EITHER SEEN BEFORE OR WOULD BE SIMILAR TO ONE WE HAD SEEN BEFORE
WHY DO YOU STUDY THIS BOOK WAS IT ASSIGNED

MORIN IS BADLY MISNAMED AND SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR INTRODUCTORY COURSES AT ALL I DON'T KNOW YOUR BACKGROUND BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT LEVEL THIS BOOK CAN QUICKLY QUENCH YOUR LOVE FOR MECHANICS OR EVEN PHYSICS

IF YOU ARE FORCED TO USE IT AS A FIRST BOOK AND SEE NO WAY TO A SOLUTION I'D JUST PEEK AT THE ANSWER A SOUTH A PAGE

A STARTUP IN WHAT YOU SHOULD PLAN TO WORK FOR SOMEONE ELSE UNTIL YOU HAVE AN IDEA THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH TO START A COMPANY OVER AND EVEN THEN YOU SHOULD PLAN TO DEVELOP IT WITHOUT SETTING OUT ON YOUR OWN FOR A WHILE

A PHD IS COOL BUT I DOUBT ANOTHER YEARS OF SCHOOL WILL HELP IF YOU WANT TO START A COMPANY
THE ONLY DIRECT PATH TO HAVING A SUCCESSFUL STARTUP IS TO BE LUCKY WEALTHY OR PRESTIGIOUS HARD WORK AND RESEARCH ACUMEN ARE ALWAYS GOOD THINGS TO HAVE BUT THEY WON'T NECESSARILY HELP AS MUCH AS YOU MIGHT THINK HAVING A SUCCESSFUL STARTUP IS MORE ABOUT BEING GOOD AT BUSINESS AND SALESMANSHIP AND LESS ABOUT BEING GOOD AT SOLVING DIFFICULT PROBLEMS

HAVING A PHD CAN HELP WITH THE PRESTIGE THING IF YOU ARE DR THEN PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY AND IT CAN BE EASIER TO GET FUNDING THIS IS DOUBLY TRUE IF YOU GET YOUR PHD FROM A MORE PRESTIGIOUS INSTITUTION IF YOU HAVE A PHD IN A TECHNICAL SUBJECT FROM A PLACE LIKE STANFORD OR MIT YOU CAN FIND YOURSELF IN SITUATIONS WHERE POTENTIAL FUNDERS WILL PRACTICALLY THROW MONEY AT YOU YOUR EDUCATION AT SUCH A PLACE WON'T NECESSARILY BE THAT MUCH BETTER THAN YOUR EDUCATION WOULD BE SOMEWHERE ELSE BUT BRAND NAME COUNTS FOR A LOT IN CERTAIN CIRCLES

AS FAR AS SIMPLY HAVING THE KNOWLEDGE NECESSARY TO SUCCESSFULLY APPLY ALGORITHMS TO SOLVE PROBLEMS A PHD WOULD CERTAINLY HELP A LOT BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S STRICTLY NECESSARY IT'S PROBABLY OVERKILL FOR YOUR GOALS

CONSIDER THIS IF YOU'RE A FRESHMEN NOW AND IF YOU WORK REALLY HARD THEN YOU'LL HAVE A PHD YEARS FROM NOW A LOT CAN CHANGE IN YEARS YOU WILL CHANGE A LOT AS A PERSON AND THE ECONOMY CAN CHANGE A LOT TOO SUCH TO THE POINT THAT IT MIGHT NOT MAKE AS MUCH SENSE TO TRY TO BUILD A STARTUP STARTUPS ARE COOL THESE DAYS IN PART BECAUSE THEY'RE ONE FORM OF INVESTMENT THAT OFFERS A POTENTIALLY HIGH RATE OF RETURN WHEN THE INTEREST RATE RISES WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO FUNDING FOR STARTUPS

IF YOU WANT TO PREPARE YOURSELF AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FOR APPLYING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS THEN THE BEST THING THAT YOU CAN DO IS TO TAKE MATH CLASSES A LACK OF THE PROPER MATH IS WHAT HOLDS BACK MOST CS UNDERGRADS FROM BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND AND USE MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES THE MATH THAT YOU'LL NEED IN PARTICULAR IS ANALYSIS I EAST CALCULUS ALSO MULTIVARIABLE LINEAR ALGEBRA PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS AND OPTIMIZATION THEORY YOU SHOULDN'T NECESSARILY TAKE COURSES ON ALL OF THESE THINGS IN THE MATH DEPARTMENT THOUGH IF THE ENGINEERING OR COMPUTER SCIENCE DEPARTMENTS OFFER EQUIVALENT COURSES THEN YOU MIGHT TAKE THOSE INSTEAD SINCE THEY TEND TO BE MORE
YOU SHOULD GO TO BUSINESS SCHOOL IF YOU WANT TO START YOUR OWN COMPANY

THAT WILL HELP YOU A LOT MORE THAN A PHD IN PHYSICS ESPECIALLY IN THE FIELD OF AI WHICH HAS VERY LITTLE TO DO WITH PHYSICS
ONE OF THE WORST WEBSITES I HAVE EVER SEEN MANDATORY ADVERTISEMENT VIEWING BEFORE IT SHOWS YOU CONTENT AND THE ARTICLE IN QUESTION TAKES UP THE LEFT THIRD OF THE PAGE WITH THE REST TAKEN UP BY OTHER LINKS PLEASE PROVIDE A BETTER SOURCE
ARTICLE DOESN'T REALLY SAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT IT IS A POSSIBLE GRAPHEME ALTERNATIVE DOI OF THE PAPER MENTIONED IN THE ARTICLE
MY ADVICE WOULD BE READ MORE TEXTBOOKS LESS POPSCI
I'M GONNA BE A LITTLE BLUNT HERE YOU'RE A SMART KID BUT YOU'RE NOT FEYNMAN I WAS GOING THROUGH YOUR PROFILE HISTORY AND YOU CAN BE QUITE UP YOUR OWN ASS ON CERTAIN SUBS I'M TELLING YOU THIS CAUSE YOU NEED A LITTLE HUMILITY IF YOU ARE GETTING IN EVERY EXAM IN PHYSICS IN HIGH SCHOOL THEN YOU CAN SAY YOU ARE LEARNING NOTHING TO BE AND JUMP TO QUANTUM READS LIKE SOMETHING FROM R IAMVERYSMART QUANTUM ISN'T JUST PHILOSOPHY I HOPE YOU ARE DOING THE MATHS TOO CAUSE ITS QUITE DIFFICULT

AS FOR FURTHER LEARNING TRY SOME OF THE PHYSICS BOOKS AVAILABLE SUCH AS FEYNMAN LECTURES QUITE A GOOD STARTING POINT BEFORE COLLEGE IF YOU ARE AS ADVANCED AS YOU SAY

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN SOME HEALTHCARE RELATED TO PHYSICS YOU CAN READ UP ON MEDICAL PHYSICS WHICH IS FASCINATING I HAVE A BACHELOR'S IN THIS FIELD PLENTY OF STARTING MATERIAL OUT THERE AND ISN'T TAUGHT IN HIGH SCHOOL
DO YOU WANT HELP WRITING A BOOK OR DO YOU WANT TO STUDY PHYSICS FURTHER

IF THE LATTER I'M AFRAID YOU HAVE TO PUT UP WITH HIGH SCHOOL FOR NOW GET GOOD GRADES AND KEEP YOUR INTERESTS UP BY READING AROUND THE SUBJECT THEN WHEN YOU GET TO UNI COLLEGE YOU WILL LEARN LOADS MORE

AN AMERICAN WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP MUCH MORE HERE BUT IF YOU WERE IN BRITAIN I'D RECOMMEND JOINING THE INSTITUTE OF PHYSICS THEY HAVE THERE FINGERS IN A WHOLE LOAD OF OUTREACH EVENTS SEND A MONTHLY MAGAZINE THAT IS UNDERSTANDABLE AT THE UNDERGRADUATE LEVEL WHICH IS WHERE YOU SEEM TO BE AIMING AND HAVE A WHOLE HOST OF CAREERS ADVICE STUDENT MEMBERSHIP IS CHEAP TOO

HOWEVER AS A STUDENT IN AMERICA MAYBE LOOK INTO THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF PHYSICS INSTEAD I BELIEVE THEY DO SIMILAR THINGS THOUGH AN AMERICAN BASED PHYSICIST MAY BE ABLE TO CONFIRM WHETHER THIS WOULD BE WORTHWHILE

THESE ORGANISATIONS ARE AIMED AT PROFESSIONAL PHYSICISTS THOUGH AN AMBITIOUS STUDENT SUCH AS YOURSELF MAY GET SOMETHING OUT OF THEM THE BRITISH ORGANISATION CERTAINLY ENCOURAGES MEMBERSHIP FROM PHYSICS STUDENTS AGED AT THE VERY LEAST IT'D BE SOMETHING TO WRITE ABOUT ON A COLLEGE APPLICATION


I DROPPED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AT I WAS A BAD STUDENT ALTHOUGH I WAS INTELLIGENT AND WASN'T LEARNING ANYTHING I DO AGREE THAT FOR SOME PEOPLE HIGH SCHOOL DOESN'T REALLY TEACH YOU ANYTHING ALTHOUGH I DO THINK THAT STUDY HABITS AND SOCIAL INTERACTIONS ARE SOME OF THE MORE VALUABLE THINGS YOU LEARN IN HIGH SCHOOL EVEN MORE SO THAN THE ACTUAL INFORMATION TAUGHT IN CLASSES

I ALWAYS THOUGHT OF MYSELF AS EXTREMELY INTELLIGENT AND I FELT MUCH LIKE YOU DO AT YOUR AGE BUT PLEASE REALIZE THAT EVEN IF YOU ARE THE TOP IN YOUR HIGH SCHOOL UNLESS YOUR HIGH SCHOOL IS SUPER SPECIAL THE TOP MIGHT ONLY BE THE TOP AT YOUR UNIVERSITY AND WITH A DEGREE LIKE PHYSICS THE TOP AT YOUR HIGH SCHOOL MIGHT NOT EVEN BE AS INTELLIGENT AS THE TOP IN YOUR INTERMEDIATE PHYSICS CLASSES

YES I THOUGHT I WAS VERY INTELLIGENT UNTIL I WAS SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO WERE ACTUALLY VERY INTELLIGENT THIS IS WHY YOU ARE GETTING SOME HOSTILE RESPONSES YOU HAVEN'T GONE THROUGH THIS YET EVEN IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE AND ARE GETTING FEEDBACK FROM PEOPLE WHO ONCE CONSIDERED THEMSELVES THE SMARTEST IN THE ROOM AND NOW FIND THEMSELVES TO BE EXTREMELY AVERAGE IN A ROOM FULL OF PHYSICS FOLKS AND EVEN PEOPLE THAT I BELIEVE TO BE EXTREMELY INTELLIGENT DON'T FEEL VERY SMART BECAUSE THEY WORK WITH FOLKS MORE INTELLIGENT THAN THEMSELVES

I QUICKLY REALIZED THAT BEING THE SMARTEST PERSON IN THE ROOM SAID MORE ABOUT WHO I WAS CHOOSING TO SURROUND MYSELF WITH THAN HOW INTELLIGENT I ACTUALLY WAS



OKAY ANYWAY NOW THAT I GOT THAT OUT OF THE WAY

BEST THING FOR YOU TO DO RIGHT NOW IS TO WATCH PHYSICS LECTURES ONLINE MIT HAS THEIR ENTIRE PHYSICS I THINK ITS TITLED ACTUALLY COURSE ON YOUTUBE THEY HAVE COURSEWORK THAT GOES ALONG WITH THE VIDEO SO YOU CAN ESSENTIALLY TAKE PHYSICS CLASSES ON YOUR OWN

I KNOW YOU'RE INTERESTED IN QUANTUM BUT YOU'RE PUTTING THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE THERE'S A VERY GOOD REASON WHY YOU DON'T LEARN ANY QUANTUM MECHANICS YOUR FIRST YEAR AND EVEN IF YOU FEEL PREPARED TO DIVE IN UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AREN'T READY

BASICALLY YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND QUANTUM MECHANICS BY JUST READING WHAT IT IS ANYMORE THAN YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HOW GREAT OF AN ARTIST VAN GOGH WAS WITHOUT HAVING ANY KNOWLEDGE OF BRUSH STROKES WITHOUT KNOWING THE MATH THAT GOES INTO QUANTUM YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY SAYING STARRY NIGHT IS A PRETTY PAINTING WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WHY ITS SPECIAL

IF YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT PHYSICS AND REALLY BECAUSE OF YOUR INTEREST AND YOUR TALENT AT PHYSICS YOU SHOULD CONSIDER IT FOR YOUR MAJOR YOU NEED TO START LOOKING INTO WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO GET YOUR UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE YOU CAN FIND SOME YEAR PLANS FOR PHYSICS STUDENTS THAT WILL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE LAYOUT AND FROM THERE YOU CAN CHART A COURSE FOR LEARNING PHYSICS

HERE'S A SAMPLE FROM STANFORD YOU NEED TO LOOK UP WHAT THE COURSE NUMBERS ARE BUT IT'LL GIVE YOU A GOOD IDEA

YOU CAN START WORKING YOUR WAY THROUGH COURSES BUT FOLLOW THE PATHOLOGY JUMPING INTO QUANTUM BEFORE YOU LEARN EVERYTHING LEADING UP TO IT IS A GOOD WAY TO END UP MISINFORMED OR DISCOURAGED

HERE'S WHAT I SUGGEST

WATCH PHYSICS INTRO TO CLASSICAL MECHANICS AND CALCULUS LECTURES SIMULTANEOUSLY CALCULUS SHOULD HAVE INITIAL PRIORITY OVER PHYSICS PHYSICS 2 INTRO TO ELECTROMAGNETISM AND CALCULUS 2 SHOULD BE TAKEN SIMULTANEOUSLY OR YOU SHOULD AT LEAST FINISH CALCULUS 2 BEFORE PHYSICS 2 THEN YOU MOVE ON TO PHYSICS MODERN PHYSICS AND CALCULUS

MODERN PHYSICS IS WHERE YOU'LL GET YOUR FIRST INTRODUCTION TO QUANTUM MECHANICS AND THERE'S A GOOD REASON FOR THAT PHYSICS AND 2 ARE STEPPING STONES TO QUANTUM BY PROVIDING THE NECESSARY PROBLEM SOLVING TECHNIQUES AND TEACHING YOU TO THINK LIKE A PHYSICIST

SEE MODERN PHYSICS PHYSICS INTRODUCES YOU TO EQUATION THIS IS THE BREAD AND BUTTER OF QUANTUM MECHANICS IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE EQUATION MEANS THEN YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND QUANTUM MECHANICS

PHYSICS IS LIKE A STAIRCASE YOU'RE CURRENTLY ON THE GROUND FLOOR THE SECOND FLOOR IS QUANTUM MECHANICS YOU CANNOT GET TO THE SECOND FLOOR WITHOUT TAKING THE NECESSARY STEPS WITHOUT THAT INITIAL FOUNDATION CALCULUS IS THE FOUNDATION AND INTRO PHYSICS CLASSES ARE THE GUARDRAIL THAT HELPS YOU MAKE YOUR WAY UP

GOOD LUCK TO YOU
LIKE U GAUTAMPK SAID YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE TO JUST PUT UP WITH HIGH SCHOOL FOR THE NEXT COUPLE DON'T WORRY BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE ALREADY FILLING YOUR FREE TIME WITH THINGS YOU ENJOY LEARNING

IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN LEARNING TO WRITE BETTER READING IS KEY READING SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES AND BOOKS ARE GOOD FOR EDUCATING YOURSELF ON THE FIELD BUT NOT NECESSARILY FOR PUSHING YOU TO WRITE BETTER I'D SUGGEST PICKING UP SOME FICTION FUN AND INTERESTING READS SEEING DIFFERENT WAYS TO EXPRESS THE SAME THOUGHT CREATES A LARGER TOOLBOX FOR YOU TO PULL FROM WHEN WRITING

LIKE YOU SAID THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS IS PRACTICE DON'T BE AFRAID OF FAILING WRITING HOW YOU SPEAK IS A GREAT WAY TO START
OKAY I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM LET ME GIVE YOU SOME ADVICE

BE HUMBLE KEEP READING DON'T WRITE A BOOK GO TO UNIVERSITY

IF YOU HAVE ANY INTERESTING IDEAS WRITE THEM DOWN AND SAVE THEM FOR LATER THE ODDS THAT IT'S A NEW OR USEFUL IDEA ARE VERY LOW FOR SOMEONE OF YOUR LEVEL
AGREEING WITH OTHERS HERE I HIGHLY DOUBT YOU'VE DONE ANY MATHEMATICS WORK IN QUANTUM OR ASTRO AND YOU'VE SIMPLY READ POP SCIENCE BOOKS ABOUT THE MORE METAPHYSICAL ELEMENTS

IF YOU HAVE DONE MATH WORK THEN THE FOLLOWING QUESTION SHOULD BE FAIRLY SIMPLE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD FOR YOU

CAN YOU APPLY THE HAMILTONIAN OPERATOR TO A WAVE FUNCTION TO FIND THE KINETIC ENERGY OF AN ORBITAL

IF YOU DON'T KNOW HALF THE WORDS IN THAT SENTENCE DON'T BE DISCOURAGED BUT THAT IS BASIC ENTRY LEVEL QUANTUM MECHANICS IS IT HEAVY MATH WE'RE TALKING PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS HERE MUCH HIGHER THAN WHAT I IMAGINE YOU'VE SEEN BEFORE IN YOUR STUDIES

IF YOU WANT TO PICK UP AN ACTUAL TEXTBOOK TRY INTRODUCTION TO QUANTUM MECHANICS BY GRIFFITHS AND SEE HOW MUCH YOU CAN GET THROUGH
TALK TO PROFESSORS AT NEARBY UNIVERSITIES AND SEE IF THEY NEED ANY HELP IN THEIR LABS I'VE SEEN VOLUNTEER TO DO REAL RESEARCH IN PHYSICS LABS BEFORE

I'M CURIOUS WHAT ARE YOU WRITING YOUR BOOK ABOUT
HONESTLY THERE IS SO MUCH OUT THERE THERE ARE A LOT OF GREAT YOUTUBE CHANNELS THAT PRESENT A LOT OF MATERIAL IN REALLY COOL WAYS I AM BY NO MEANS SAYING TO ONLY USE THEM TO LEARN BUT RATHER USE THEM TO FIND OUT WHAT REALLY INTERESTS YOU YOUR LUCKY TO BE BORN IN AN AGE WERE ALMOST ANYTHING YOU WANTED TO KNOW IS GOOGLE SEARCH AWAY EVEN IF THE TOPIC DOESN'T INTEREST YOU THEY ARE STILL GREAT
SOME ARE THESE ARE MATH CHANNELS AND OTHER TOPICS BUT THEY ARE FANTASTIC

VERITASIUM

SIXTY SYMBOLS

NUMBERPHILE

SMARTER EVERYDAY

FRAME OF ESSENCE

OF COURSE THIS IS JUST A LIST OF THE CHANNELS I COULD REMEMBER OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD ALSO FOR COMMUNITIES IN MY EXPERIENCE YOU ONLY REALLY NEED TO FIND ONE PERSON OR A FEW PEOPLE THAT SHARE YOUR PASSION FROM THERE YOU CAN JUST SHARE YOU INTERESTS AND IN DOING SO YOU KEEP YOUR PASSION ALIVE YOU HAVE A LONG ROAD AHEAD OF YOU TRY NOT TO TRAVEL ALONE
THERE IS ACTUALLY SOME GREAT PHYSICS METUMPS IN NY
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT OF PARTICIPATING IN THE GOOGLE SCIENCE FAIR
COMPETE IN THE PHYSICS OLYMPIADS
CHECK OUT PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS

YOU COULD ALSO TRY MASTER CLASS U DUKWON
DO YOU KNOW OF A COMMUNITY BESIDES R PHYSICS OR A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT LOVE TO DO THE SAME THING WE DO

OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD

R AUTODIDACT SMALL BUT CLOSEST TO WHAT YOU'RE ASKING

R MATH FOR THE MATHS SIDE MANY POSTS AND DISCUSSIONS ON THERE ARE QUITE ADVANCED THOUGH JUST FYI

STACKEXCHANGE FOR QUESTIONS YOU MAY IN YOUR SELF-DIRECTED STUDIES READINGS

OLYMPIADS SUMMER SCHOOLS AND INTERNATIONAL SCIENCE FAIR AORTA THINGS THOSE COMMUNITIES WILL HAVE SIMILAR MINDED STUDENTS YOUR AGE

ALSO HERE'S A GOOD VIDEO FROM R AUTODIDACT

DO YOU THINK THEY FEEL LOVE OR JOY AT THEIR MEETING
WHY ARE COLORED LINES NOT CIRCLES
WHAT ARE SCALAR CONTOURS OF THE FIELD DO YOU MEAN THEY CONTOURS OF CONSTANT FIELD MAGNITUDE
THE MUSIC
FUNNY MESMERIZING AND WAY TOO SHORT
THEY NEVER COLLIDE
YOU SHOULD MAKE THEM COME CLOSER AND COLLIDE OR BLOW UP OR SOMETHING

I'VE BEEN DESENSITIZED BY THE INTERNET
ISN'T IT JUST THE MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY THAT'S GIVEN BY THE CARNOT CYCLE AS LONG AS YOU GET WORK OVER HEAT PUT IN YOU'RE GOLDEN RIGHT
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL I WAS BLOWN AWAY BY TRIANGLE AND THE GOLDEN SPIRAL I CONSUMED AS MUCH MATHEMATICS AS I COULD AND LEARNED AS MUCH AS MY TEACHERS BOOKS AND FREE TIME WOULD ALLOW ME WHEN I GOT TO UNIVERSITY I QUICKLY REALIZED I DIDN'T EXCEL IN LABS AND SO I KNEW THEORY WAS FOR ME I REALIZED I HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH NO TURNING BACK WHEN I FIRST DERIVED THE EINSTEIN FIELD EQUATION OF GENERAL RELATIVITY NOW AS A RESEARCH SCIENTIST I MARVEL AT MY PRIVILEGE IN BEING ABLE TO ATTEMPT AT UNDERSTANDING HOW NATURE WORK I'M EVEN MORE GRATEFUL THAT I AM PAID TO DO THIS BECAUSE IN ALL HONESTY I'D PROBABLY DO IT FOR NO MONEY AS WELL BUT DON'T TELL THE FUNDING AGENCY
I STARTED AT UNIVERSITY TAKING A BUNCH OF SCIENCE COURSES AND THOUGHT THAT PHYSICS WAS THE MOST INTERESTING SO I DECIDED TO MAJOR IN THAT I DID AN UNDERGRADUATE THESIS PROJECT IN GENERAL RELATIVITY AND THEN TOOK A RESEARCH JOB IN AN ULTRASOUND LAB DOING THEORY AND SIMULATIONS THEN I WENT BACK TO SCHOOL FOR MY MASTER'S AND PH D WORKING ON EXPERIMENTAL BIOPHYSICS DURING THAT TIME I ALSO WROTE AND PUBLISHED A FEW PAPERS ON THE SIDE ONE OF WHICH GOT ME ONTO INTERNATIONAL NEWS I FINISHED MY PH D IN SUMMER AND AM NOW A POSTHOC
I'M ABOUT TO STUDY ASTROPHYSICS I LOVE IT AND CAN'T WAIT
I ALWAYS ENJOYED SCIENCE LESSONS AT SCHOOL BUT MY FAVOURITE WAS DEFINITELY MATHS AT A LEVEL THE COURSES TAKEN IN THE UK WHEN YOU'RE I DID MATHS PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY AND THAT'S WHEN I STARTED TO SEE THAT MY FAVOURITE PARTS OF PHYSICS HAD LOTS OF MATHS AND MY FAVOURITE PARTS OF MATHS WERE THE MECHANICS COURSES AS WELL AS CALCULUS AND ALGEBRA THAT ARE KEY IN HIGHER LEVEL PHYSICS I ALSO LEARNT THAT I DON'T LIKE CHEMISTRY I'M NOW IN MY FIRST YEAR OF A PHYSICS DEGREE AND HOPE TO MAKE A CAREER OUT OF IT
I GOT MY FIRST PREPRINT ON THE ARXIV TODAY
GOT INTO BA OF PHYSICS IN YEAR OF QUIT DUE TO FAMILY REASONS

I HAVE BEEN AN AVID THEORETICAL PHYSICS READER SINCE EARLY ALSO I HAVE GIVEN PRIVATE LESSONS IN PHYSICS ON SECONDARY SCHOOL LEVEL

I'M NOT SURE IF I WILL COME BACK TO PHYSICS OR KEEP IT AS A HOBBY BUT I READ THIS SUB EVERY DAY AND I TALK ABOUT UNDERSTANDING THE WORLD THROUGH EYES OF PHYSICS WITH NON PEOPLE
I'M ON THE EDGE OF FAILING MY SECOND PHYSICS COURSE I THINK I'LL DROP OUT OF UNI OR SWITCH TO COMPUTER SCIENCE
I STARTED MY INTEREST WHEN I WAS PRETTY YOUNG MY DAD AND HIS BROTHER BOTH STUDIED PHYSICS IN COLLEGE AND LIKED TO TALK ABOUT IT I READ THROUGH SOME OF THEIR OLD TEXTBOOKS AND DECIDED THAT I LOVED SOLVING THESE KINDS OF PROBLEMS
I'M FINISHING UP MY SENIOR YEAR OF UNDERGRAD NOW AS A PHYSICS MAJOR AND IT'S LOOKING LIKE MY GRADES HAVEN'T BEEN GOOD ENOUGH TO GO TO GRAD SCHOOL I REALLY HOPE THAT I CAN FIND A WAY TO STAY IN THE FIELD IT'S ALL THAT I CAN IMAGINE DOING
AFTER HIGHSCHOOL I WENT TO COLLEGE TO STUDY PHILOSOPHY I ENDED UP GETTING VERY DEPRESSED I DROPPED OUT AND LIVED NOWHERE FOR A WHILE CRASHING ON COUCHES ETC EVENTUALLY I GOT A JOB AT A BANK ONE DAY AS I WAS SCROLLING THROUGH THE NEWS AT WORK I SAW SOMETHING ABOUT THE HIGGS BOSON I FELL IN LOVE WITH LEARNING EVERYTHING I COULD IN REGARDS TO THE SUBJECT THE REST IS HISTORY NOW I AM AT UNIVERSITY STUDYING PHYSICS I AM PART OF A HEP RESEARCH GROUP I LOVE MY LIFE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME I AM HAPPY
WAS WORKING AS MACHINIST AND ALWAYS WAS FASCINATED BY SCIENCE SIR ISAAC NEWTON DIDN'T KNOW SPARKED CURIOSITY TRIED IN SIMPLE WAYS UNDERSTAND AND EXPLAIN HOW GRAVITY WORKS GAUGE BLOCKS PRECISION TOOLS HELPED ME TO FIND OUT ABOUT WEAK FORCE THEN DEDUCTED GRAVITY MUST BE BY PRODUCT OF MOLECULAR ATTRACTION NOT ALWAYS IS SO AND THIS BOTHERS ME NOW TRYING TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS NOT ALWAYS INTERESTING BUT UNKNOWN PART WORKING ON IT
MY PHYSICS JOURNEY IS STILL BEGINNING I STARTED ON THE OPPOSITE END OF THE SUBJECT LINE I STUDIED HUMANITIES AND ART AND EVEN THOUGH I WILL ALWAYS THINK OF ART AS ONE OF MY PASSIONS THE THRILL OF UNDERSTANDING NATURE AND THE UNIVERSE THAT SURROUNDS US COULDN'T BE COMPARED THAT THRILL CAME TO ME ONE DAY WHEN I READ ABOUT SPACE AND HOW VAST IT IS AND TINY WE ARE THAT JUST OPENED UP MY MIND TO WANT TO KNOW MORE TO WANT TO UNDERSTAND ALL OF IT

I'VE LOOKED FOR INFORMATION ONLINE THAT GAVE ME ACCESS TO MORE THAN A DOZEN TEXT BOOKS AND NOTES AND I'M MORE THAN CONVINCED THAT THIS IS WHAT I WANT STUDYING ON MY OWN I'VE MANAGED TO BUILD A NICE UNDERSTANDING ON THE BASICS AND ON THE MATH ALTHOUGH I STILL NEED SOME HELP

I'M CURRENTLY STUDYING A FP FORMACIÓN PROFESSIONAL I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'D CALL THAT IN ENGLISH SORRY TO BE A MACHINIST AFTER I'M DONE WITH THOSE STUDIES I'LL APPLY TO UNIVERSITY AND START THE REAL JOURNEY IN PHYSICS
I LURK THIS SUB SOMETIMES BUT HAVEN'T POSTED BEFORE I THINK I FOLLOWED A WEIRD PATH TO GET HERE AND REMINISCING IS FUN DUNNO IF ANYONE WANTS TO READ A LONG RAMBLING POST BUT FUCK IT

I LOVED MATH AND SCIENCE AS A KID BUT I HATED THE SCHOOL SYSTEM SO MUCH THAT I LOST IT PRETTY EARLY I WAS NEVER THE KID THAT WON SCIENCE FAIRS AND WATCHED BILL NYE AND STUFF I WANTED TO WRITE NOVELS OR COMICS OR SOMETHING MY DAD AND I WOULD HAVE LONG TALKS SOMETIMES ABOUT TIME TRAVEL AND ANTIMATTER AND STRING THEORY AND STUFF BUT I NEVER REALLY CONNECTED ANY OF THIS TO WHAT I WAS DOING AT SCHOOL

EVENTUALLY I HATED PUBLIC SCHOOL SO MUCH EXCEPT CHEMISTRY CLASS THAT WAS KINDA COOL THAT I TALKED MY PARENTS INTO LETTING ME FINISH HIGH SCHOOL THROUGH A HOMESCHOOLING SYSTEM A SWITCH BASICALLY FLIPPED AND I REALIZED OH SHIT I LOVE MATH I JUST HATE HIGH SCHOOL AT THE TIME I WAS TAKING PHYSICS AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD TAKEN A SCIENCE CLASS WHERE YOU COULD DERIVE EVERYTHING WITH MATH INSTEAD OF JUST BEING TOLD TO MEMORIZE RANDOM FACTS THERE WERE NIGHTS I COULDN'T SLEEP CAUSE I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE PROBLEMS ON MY HOMEWORK OR GOING THROUGH THE BOOKS ON PHYSICS IN MY DAD'S STUDY A BOOK OF HUBBLE PICTURES ACTUALLY MOVED ME TO TEARS AND READING ABOUT GENERAL RELATIVITY FOR THE FIRST TIME MADE MY HEART ALL FLUTTERY

I WAS TAKING CLASSES AT THE TIME SINCE I HAD THOUGHT I WAS GOING INTO HUMANITIES BUT I TAUGHT MYSELF ENOUGH EXTRA PHYSICS TO TAKE THE AP TEST EVEN THOUGH I WASN'T IN THE CLASS AND DIDN'T KNOW CALCULUS THEN TAUGHT MYSELF TRIG AND SO I COULD JUMP RIGHT INTO CALCULUS

I DIDN'T REALLY FEEL LIKE A SCIENCE PERSON SINCE I DIDN'T GROW UP LIKING IT AND ALL THE SCIENCE PEOPLE I KNEW WERE GUYS WHO KNEW THINGS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY AND TALKED ABOUT GEEK STUFF AND I WAS THIS GIRLY GIRL WHO'D NEVER SEEN STAR WARS AND BARELY UNDERSTOOD MY LAPTOP BUT I WAS ABOUT TO START COLLEGE AND NEEDED TO PICK A MAJOR SO I FIGURED I'D JUST GO WITH PHYSICS AND SEE WHAT HAPPENED

ANYWAY IT WORKED OUT PRETTY WELL I'VE DONE LIKE THREE SUMMER RESEARCH EXPERIENCES AND BEEN DOING RESEARCH AT MY SCHOOL FOR TWO YEARS I LOVED THE SHIT OUT OF MY CLASSES QUANTUM WAS THE BEST FOUND A SUBFIELD I REALLY LIKE AND NOW I'M APPLYING TO PHD PROGRAMS STILL FEEL A BIT OUT OF PLACE IN PHYSICS SOMETIMES BUT I'M GONNA SEE HOW FAR I CAN TAKE THIS
I WAS ON A SIMILAR BOAT IN REGARDS TO WHAT INSPIRED ME TO PURSUE A B SOUTH IN PHYSICS I DISCOVERED THAT AS MUCH AS I LIKE THE SUBJECT IT'S NOT FOR ME TOO MUCH OF AN INVESTMENT MONEY AND TIME

I ENDED UP GOING INTO THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY CALI AS A QA ENGINEER AFTER GRADUATION

I'M ALMOST DONE WITH STUDENT LOANS AND GET TO ENJOY VACATIONS
I STARTED AS AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER AS A FRESHMAN BUT AFTER TAKING THE FIRST TWO PHYSICS CLASSES I WANTED TO SEE IF ELECTRICAL WAS THE BEST FIT FOR ME I SWITCHED TO PHYSICS AND FOUND THAT I LOVE QUANTUM AND SOLID STATE THE MOST NOW APPLYING TO CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS PROGRAMS AND A FEW FOR MATERIALS ENGINEERING
I READ A BOOK CALLED QUANTUM WHEN I WAS IT WAS A POPULAR SCIENCE BOOK ON QUANTUM MECHANICS AND I QUITE LIKED IT I HAD ALWAYS LOVED SCIENCE FOR A LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER BUT AFTER THAT I KNEW PHYSICS WAS MY FAVORITE I READ MORE POPSCI BOOKS UNTIL I WAS AND I REALIZED IF I WANTED TO LEARN PHYSICS PROPERLY I WOULD NEED TO LEARN CALCULUS SO I TAUGHT MYSELF CALCULUS WITH PRIMARILY STEWART BUT I ALSO READ AN OLD BOOK CALCULUS MADE EASY THAT USED INFINITESIMALS INSTEAD OF LIMITS NOW I AM USING CLASSICAL MECHANICS BOOK AND AM ALSO DOING PHYSICS RESEARCH AT LOCAL UNI LABORATORY
INTEREST SINCE LITTLE KID CERN MASTER CLASS AND AP PHYSICS I AND II IN HIGH SCHOOL MAJORED IN UNDERGRAD CHANGED TO MORE ECE IN GRAD
I WAS AN ENGINEERING MAJOR BUT DID NOT MEET THE GA REQUIREMENT IN MY JUNIOR YEAR AFTER TRYING A FEW THINGS FOR A SEMESTER I SWITCHED TO PHYSICS SINCE THAT WAS CLOSEST TO ENGINEERING AND WAS INTELLECTUALLY STIMULATING ENDED UP GOING TO GRADUATE SCHOOL FOR A MASTERS TO SHOW I CAN DO THE WORK MY UNDERGRAD GA WAS PRETTY LOW IF WORK WILL PAY FOR IT AND I CAN FIND A SCHOOL THAT WILL ALLOW IT I'D LIKE TO GO BACK FOR A PHD
A SNOW BALL
A STELLAR MAP
I ALWAYS LIKE GETTING SHIRTS WITH CATS ON THEM SPACE CATS ARE THE BEST
THIS MIGHT NOT GO OVER WELL WITH THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY BUT I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT THE INTRODUCTORY PHYSICS COURSE IN CALCULUS BASED CLASSICAL MECHANICS THAT PHYSICS UNDERGRADUATES ARE REQUIRED TO TAKE IS IN A SENSE THE MOST DIFFICULT COURSE THAT THEY WILL PROBABLY EVER TAKE I ATTRIBUTE THIS TO PRECISELY THE DILEMMA THAT YOU ARE EXPERIENCING

PHYSICS SUDDENLY BECOMES EASIER WHEN YOU LEARN THIS LOGICAL THOROUGHNESS IN FACT ALL MATHEMATICS STEM DOES IN STEM CIRCLES THIS IS CALLED MATHEMATICAL MATURITY

SO YOUR DIFFICULTLY IN THIS CLASS IS ABSOLUTELY NORMAL THE MATHEMATICAL MATURITY WILL COME IF YOU ARE TALENTED IT WILL COME QUICKLY WITH SUFFICIENT EFFORT IF YOU ARE NOT IT WILL TAKE MORE PRACTICE BUT YOU WILL GET IT JUST KEEP AT IT AND DON'T CUT CORNERS IF YOU ARE UNSURE OF A PHYSICAL PRINCIPLE READ A DERIVATION THEN TRY TO DERIVE IT FOR YOURSELF LATER ABOVE ALL ELSE MAKE SURE THAT YOU LEARN CONCEPTUALLY DO NOT FALL INTO THE TRAP OF THINKING THAT MEMORIZATION CAN HELP YOU IT WILL NEVER KEEP THESE IDEAS IN MIND AND REMEMBER THAT IF THE PHYSICS IS HARD THAT'S OK IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
MORE OF A SMALL TIP THAN AN PLAN FOR SUCCESS BUT HERE'S WHERE I STARTED NOTICING THE CHANGE FOCUS ON UNITS MORE WHEN DOING CALCULATIONS UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN UNITS AND THE FORMULAS TRANSFORM EQUATIONS INTO OTHER FORMS FOR CURIOSITY PROPER TREATMENT AND CONSIDERATION OF THE UNITS CAN HELP YOU GAIN INSIGHTS INTO PROBLEMS WHERE YOU MIGHT OTHERWISE BE STUCK ONCE YOU START SEEING THESE RELATIONSHIPS A LOT OF OTHER THINGS WILL CLICK MORE EASILY
MY RECOMMENDATION IS TO TRUST THE MATHS AND THE ALGEBRA YOU WILL DEVELOP INTUITION AS YOU DO MORE AND MORE OF THE NUMBER CRUNCHING AND EVENTUALLY DEVELOP YOUR OWN PERSONAL PICTURE OF THE WORLD

IT'S SOMETHING THAT COMES MORE EASILY TO SOME THAN OTHERS BUT YOU WILL EVENTUALLY DEVELOP IT FOR NOW YOU DON'T NEED THE INTUITION YOU NEED TO DO THE MATHS AND PROBLEMS IF YOU WANT AND THIS IS WHAT I DID YOU CAN READ SOME POP SCI BOOKS AND THINGS AS YOU GO ALONG I RECOMMEND THE TWO BOOKS BY COX FERNSHAW AND THE TWO BY ORZEL EACH ONE WROTE A RELATIVITY BOOK AND A QM BOOK THEY'RE PITCHED TO HIGH SCHOOL LEAVERS WELL AND THEY INCLUDE ENOUGH OF THE MATHS ALONG WITH A MOSTLY HEURISTIC PICTURE THAT REALLY LETS YOU DEVELOP AND INTUITION
AS AN ENGINEERING STUDENT PHYSICS TO ME IS A WAY OF LOOKING AT THE WORLD THROUGH RELATIONSHIPS AND EXPRESSING THOSE RELATIONSHIPS MATHEMATICALLY TO CREATE A PATH FROM THE INFORMATION YOU'RE GIVEN TO THE UNKNOWNS YOU ARE TRYING TO FIND YOU NEED TO KNOW CALCULUS VERY WELL IT'S A CRITICAL TOOL LINEAR ALGEBRA IS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR SOLVING SYSTEMS OF EQUATIONS KNOW THE MATH AND LOVE THE MATH BECAUSE WHEN MATH BECOMES SECOND NATURE THEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY FOCUS PHYSICS


VERY INTERESTING QUESTION AND WITH GOOD QUESTION ONE HAVE GOOD START ALSO IT DOES HELP IF ONE TRY TO COMPARE SOMETHING NEW OR UNKNOWN TO ALREADY KNOWN EITHER WAY
GREAT SCIENTISTS BEFORE US HELPED US TO MAKE THAT SENSE ALSO HELPS TO LEARN AND CHECK HOW DID THEY GET THOSE RESULTS FASCINATING AS IT IS INTUITION COMES WITH EXPERIENCE
EVERYTHING CLICKS INTO PLACE AND YOU CAN LOGICALLY THINK THROUGH PROBLEMS WITHOUT HAVING TO LOOK AT THE SOLUTIONS AND STUFF

THAT'S ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS AT BEST
THE PROBLEM THAT MANY BRIGHT STUDENTS HAVE WITH INTRODUCTORY PHYSICS IS THAT IT IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM EVERY OTHER CLASS IN SCHOOL MEMORIZING IS NO LONGER AN ADVANTAGE BUT SOMETIMES A DISADVANTAGE THIS IS BECAUSE NOT EVERY PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED THE SAME WAY SOMETIMES SIMILAR PROBLEMS CAN BE SOLVED IN MORE THAN ONE WAY BUT THE EASIEST WAYS ARE NOT ALWAYS THE SAME UNDERSTANDING THE OVERVIEW IS THE CONCEPT THAT NEEDS TO BE FOCUSED ON EACH CONCEPT INTRODUCED IS A PIECE OF THE PUZZLE AND ALL THE PIECES NEED TO FIT TOGETHER

SO MUCH FOR THE OVERVIEW

THE KEY IS TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEMS BEFORE YOU LOOK UP THE ANSWERS UNDERSTAND WHAT IS BEING ASKED AND WHY THIS IS AN INTERESTING PROBLEM AS THE PROBLEMS GET MORE DIFFICULT TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAS MADE THE PROBLEM MORE DIFFICULT IN THE END YOU WILL REALIZE THAT THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO COME TO THE CORRECT ANSWER BUT SOME WAYS ARE EASIER THAN OTHERS WHAT YOU ARE LEARNING IS NOT A LIST OF EQUATIONS BUT HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS WITH THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION PLAYING WITH THESE IDEAS IN YOUR HEAD AND ON PAPER BEFORE YOU CAN ACTUALLY SOLVE THE PROBLEMS WAS THE KEY TO MY LEARNING PHYSICS AND PLAYING WITH THESE IDEAS SHOULD BE FUN SO YOU KEEP WANTING TO SOLVE THEM IF YOU JUST LOOK UP THE ANSWERS YOU WILL KNOW THE ANSWER FOR THAT PROBLEM BUT YOU WON'T LEARN HOW TO SOLVE PROBLEMS
PRACTICE PHYSICS IS BASICALLY JUST A BUNCH OF HARD MATH PROBLEMS WITH HANDY EQUATIONS ON HAND DO IT ENOUGH AND I ASSURE YOU THAT YOU'LL GET BETTER AT IT
DANG THERE HAS TO BE AT LEAST
SOURCE
I MEAN IMPRESSIVE I GUESS THOUGH I'M PRETTY SURE I'VE SEEN DUDES EAT MORE AT GOLDEN CORRAL
THOUGH TO BE HONEST SUCH A BLACK HOLE WOULD HAVE AN EVENT HORIZON RADIUS OF ABOUT AU AU IS THE MEAN DISTANCE BETWEEN THE SUN AND EARTH WHICH IS REASONABLY BIG AS FAR AS BLACK HOLES ARE CONCERNED
HOW WAS THIS MADE
DAMN THAT BLACK HOLE MUST BE BRIGHT AF
WHICH SUPER MASSIVE BLACK HOLE BECAUSE THERE ARE MUCH LARGER AND MUCH SMALLER I'VE BLACK HOLES THAN THIS
SO MORE THAN
YEAH THERE IS NO WAY I WILL EVER BE ABLE TO COMPREHEND THAT

WEAK HUMAN MIND
I WISH I COULD SEE A BLOCKHOLE LIKE THAT
WHAT IS THE RATIO IN NUMBERS
IN MASS
SO A LOT
NO BLACK HOLE CONTAINS A STAR LET ALONE OUR SUN

BUT BLACK HOLES CAN BE DESCRIBED BY THEIR MASS EQUIVALENCE TO SOL

THE GIF IS COOL BUT IT GLOSSES OVER THE FACT THAT MATTER AND ENERGY ARE SIGNIFICANTLY REORGANIZED WHEN INCORPORATED INTO A BLACK HOLE

THIS HAS GOT TO BE FALSE
DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF YOUR UNIVERSITY'S PHYSICS PROGRAM AND YOUR CONNECTIONS YOU COULD GET PART TIME POSITIONS ON CAMPUS AS SOON AS YOUR SECOND SEMESTER

ACADEMIA IS ALL ABOUT MAKING CONNECTIONS SO GET TO KNOW YOUR PROFESSORS AND THEY CAN HELP YOU SECURE POSITIONS AND LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION FROM PROFESSORS ARE CRUCIAL FOR GRAD SCHOOL ENTRY IF ANY OF YOUR PROFESSORS ARE EXPERIMENTALISTS YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET A LAB POSITION WITH THEM THEORETICAL POSITIONS REQUIRE MUCH MORE MATH AND MOST STUDENTS WON'T BE PREPARED FOR THAT UNTIL THEIR THIRD OR FOURTH YEAR

IF YOUR UNIVERSITY OFFERS TUTORING YOU CAN BECOME A PHYSICS TUTOR AFTER YOU'VE TAKEN A FEW COURSES AND RECEIVED FACULTY RECOMMENDATION

ADDITIONALLY IF YOU'RE AMERICAN THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION NSF HAS PROGRAMS ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY CALLED RESEARCH EXPERIENCE FOR UNDERGRADUATES AEU MOST STUDENTS IN ARE GOING INTO THEIR THIRD OR FOURTH YEAR
IT'S NEVER TOO EARLY FOR THAT
AS EARLY AS 2ND YEAR MY PROF TOLD ME THAT THE MOST ENTHUSIASTIC STUDENTS WILLING TO DO SMALL TASKS CAN GET PART-TIME JOBS VERY SOON
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN RESEARCH I'VE EVEN SEEN INCOMING FRESHMEN HAVE RELATIVELY SIMPLE SUMMER PROJECTS TO WORK ON IN LABS DOING RESEARCH A LOT OF WHAT YOU ACTUALLY DO AS A PHYSICIST YOU LEARN ON THE FLY SO IT'S FINE TO START ASKING EARLY EVEN IF YOU AREN'T SURE IF YOU HAVE THE QUALIFICATIONS YET MANY FACULTY WILL BE WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU WHEREVER YOU ARE

FORMAL INTERNSHIPS AND RESEARCH PROGRAMS OUTSIDE YOUR DEPARTMENT SUCH AS REUS MAY HAVE STRICTER REQUIREMENTS BUT IT'S STILL A GOOD IDEA TO LOOK
YOU CAN GET THEM THE SUMMER AFTER FRESHMAN YEAR IF YOU'RE EAGER AND LUCKY
I JUST PUT THEM IN MY CV THAT I SENT IN I DID NO PUBLISHED WORK AND NOTHING THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED RESEARCH AT ALL REALLY BUT I JUST LISTED ALL OF MY PROJECTS AND THINGS IN THE EXPERIENCE SECTION
WELL IF YOU WANT TO WORK RELATIVISTICALLY THEN YOU SHOULD WORK IN A RELATIVISTIC THEORY OF GRAVITY
YOU'RE MAKING TWO CRITICAL ERRORS

FIRST MIXING SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND NEWTONIAN GRAVITY IS BROKEN IT WOULD BE SORT OF OKAY IF YOU WENT TO THE WEAK FIELD LIMIT BUT YOU'RE CALCULATING THINGS INVOLVING BLACK HOLES WHICH ARE PRETTY MUCH THE DEFINITION OF THE STRONG FIELD LIMIT GENERAL RELATIVITY EXISTS TO ANSWER THIS KIND OF QUESTION IN FACT GR TEACHES THAT ENERGY THE TIME COMPONENT OF THE MOMENTUM IS NOT EVEN CONSERVED NEAR A SCHWARZSCHILD MASSACHUSETTS INSTEAD ONLY THE TIME COMPONENT IS CONSERVED

SECOND YOU'RE USING THE KINETIC ENERGY OF A MASSIVE PARTICLE AND ASKING QUESTIONS THAT INVOLVE IT TRAVELING AT COUNTY YOU'RE GETTING NONSENSE BECAUSE SPECIAL RELATIVITY SAYS NO MASSIVE PARTICLE MAY TRAVEL AT C SO YOUR QUESTION IS NONSENSE INSTEAD YOU NEED TO EXPRESS THINGS IN TERMS OF MASSLESS PARTICLES WHAT MASS IS SO LARGE THAT LIGHT ITSELF MAY NOT ESCAPE NOT WHAT MASS IS SO LARGE THAT A MASSIVE PARTICLE WOULD NEED TO TRAVEL AT C TO ESCAPE

YOU EITHER NEED TO USE NEWTONIAN GRAVITY PLUS NEWTONIAN ENERGY GALILEAN RELATIVITY OR GENERAL RELATIVITY NOT A MIX OF RELATIVITY AND NEWTONIAN IDEAS
IT'S A COINCIDENCE NAMELY THE DIMENSIONFUL PART IS FIXED BY DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS WHILE THE PHYSICAL CONTENT IS IN THE NUMERICAL DIMENSIONLESS CONSTANT IN FRONT BY COINCIDENCE THE NEWTONIAN REASONING GET THE SAME DIMENSIONLESS NUMBER
YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT YOUR AND SYMBOLS THEY'RE MAKING YOUR POST LOOK CRAZY

ANYWAY NAIVELY SETTING ESCAPE VELOCITY TO C WITH NEWTONIAN GRAVITY DOES GET YOU THE CORRECT SCHWARZSCHILD RADIUS IF YOU TRY TO COMBINE THIS SPECIAL RELATIVITY IT WON'T REALLY WORK BUT NEWTONIAN GRAVITY ISN'T COMPATIBLE WITH SPECIAL RELATIVITY ANYWAY
FOR STATISTICAL PHYSICS I REALLY RECOMMEND DAVID LECTURE NOTES THEY'RE WELL WRITTEN AND HUMOROUS HE HAS OTHER MATERIAL AS WELL BUT ADAMIK NO QM AT THAT LEVEL

USER TONG
DEPENDING ON WHAT LEVEL OF QUANTUM YOU ARE DOING I FIND THE MIT OPEN COURSES HAVE GOOD RESOURCES

COURSES PHYSICS

COURSES PHYSICS
YOU MAY BE INTERESTED IN THE THEORETICAL MINIMUM SERIES BY LEONARD SUSSKIND WHICH IS AIMED AT PEOPLE WITH A TECHNICAL BACKGROUND BUT NOT A LOT OF TIME
FOR STAT MECHANICS THE BOOK BY GERSON HUANG IS VERY GOOD

FOR QM BOOK IS BASICALLY STANDARD LITERATURE
THE LANDAU AND LIFSHITZ SERIES IS GREAT
GRIFFITHS FOR EM AS WELL AS FOR QM AS ALREADY MENTIONED
INTRO TO STATISTICAL PHYSICS SERVES WELL AS A FIRST TEXT IN THAT SUBJECT I FOUND IT EASIER TO FOLLOW THAN OTHER TEXTS AT THAT LEVEL

UCSD PROVIDES AN EXCELLENT FREE BOOK FOR THEIR QUANTUM COURSES
SINCE I'VE NOT SEEN IT MENTIONED YET I'D LIKE TO CHIP IN AND RECOMMEND NOUREDINE ZETTILI QUANTUM MECHANICS
DEPT PES PHYSICS NZETTILI
EDIT ALSO YEAH FOR THEORY SAKURAI FTW SOMEONE ALREADY MENTIONED HIM

IT'S PRETTY HANDS ON HAS A LOT OF SOLVED EXAMPLES AND PROBLEMS WITHOUT SKIPPING MATH IN THE MIDDLE WHICH REALLY HELPS WHEN YOU'RE RESTARTING SOMETHING DOES A MIX OF DIRAC NOTATION AND INTEGRATION DEPENDING ON THE PROBLEM

AS PER FIRST COMMENT DAVID TONG WAS MY AV IN STATISTICAL PHYSIOLOGY ALTHOUGH DEPENDING ON WHAT EXACTLY YOU WANT YOU MIGHT WANT TO START WITH SOMETHING MORE BASIC AS FAR AS I REMEMBER HE JUMPS IN THE DISTRIBUTIONS QUITE FAST I THINK BOLTZMANN IS SHOWN ON LIKE PAGE TWO WHILE INTRODUCING THE CONCEPTS
SPACETIME PHYSICS IS GREAT FOR SPECIAL RELATIVITY
GRIFFITHS IS A VERY ACCESSIBLE TEXT ON QM WORTH A LOOK
INTRODUCTION TO MODERN STATISTICAL MECHANICS CONCISE AND COMPREHENSIVE
GRIFFITH FOR QM

ALSO AS A PHYSICAL CHEMIST NOW WORKING IN HEALTHCARE I RECOMMEND LOOKING INTO NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND NEWER IMAGING MODALITIES
DEFINITELY SAVING THIS THREAD A WHOLE LOT OF GOOD REFERENCES HERE
PROBLEM BOOKS IN CM AND EM ARE GOING TO BE EXTREMELY USEFUL
FOR QUANTUM JUST GO THROUGH EVERY PROBLEM IN GRIFFITHS FOR STAT MECH GET THE QUAL EXAM PREP BOOK AND DO ALL THE PROBLEMS
GRIFFITHS AND SHANKAR BOOKS FOR QUANTUM BUT PAY ATTENTION TO THE FORMULAS SOMETIMES THERE ARE MINOR DIFFERENCES SEE THEOREM
USE GRIFFITHS QM IF THAT'S TOO LIGHT TRY MERZBACHER BUT THAT'S REALLY A GRADUATE TEXT

THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A GOOD STATISTICAL MECHANICS BOOK SHOP AROUND FIND ONE THAT SUITS YOU TRY NOTES TRY SOME ONLINE SYLLABI MOOCH OR WHATEVER THEY'RE ALL GONNA SKIMP ON THE COMBINATORICS PROBABILITY STATISTICS IT'S A CRUMMY COMPROMISE SUBJECT THAT'S NEVER TAUGHT WITH THE PROPER BACKGROUND OR DEPTH
MAKE SURE TO GO TO THE BAR AND GET WASTED THE NIGHT BEFORE YOUR EXAMINATION AND DON'T DO ANY PROBLEMS OR STUDY AT ALL
JUST PRACTICE A LOT AS YOU SAY THE CONTENT ITSELF ISN'T REALLY ALL THAT DIFFICULT AND ALL THE CHALLENGE IS IN TRICKY WORDING THE ONLY WAY TO GET THROUGH THIS IS TO PRACTICE UNTIL YOU GET USED TO THE WAY QUESTIONS ARE WORDED

YOU SAY THEY'RE MULTIPLE CHOICE WHICH MEANS THERE WILL BE A REAL TEMPTATION TO SNEAK AT THE ANSWER BEFORE YOU'VE DONE IT YOURSELF BUT I'D URGE YOU NOT TO DO THIS YOU SHOULD TRY IT YOURSELF AND COME UP WITH AN ANSWER THAT YOU ARE HAPPY WITH YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO JUSTIFY IT TO YOURSELF THEN LOOK AT THE ACTUAL ANSWER AND IF THEY MATCH THEN GREAT IF THEY DON'T FIND OUT WHERE YOU WENT WRONG IN YOUR REASONING AND APPLY THAT KNOWLEDGE ON THE NEXT QUESTION
GET ALL THE QUESTIONS RIGHT
ASK THIS QUESTION TO YOUR TEACHER
I CAN'T SAY WHAT YOUR TEST WILL FOCUS THE MOST ON BUT I CAN TELL YOU WHAT YOU WILL SEE MORE OF IN THE FUTURE

FOCUS ON ENERGY AND WORK THEY COME UP A LOT IN THE FUTURE
SABOTAGE THE REST OF YOUR CLASS BY REPLACING THE COURSE WEBSITE WITH DEEPAK YOUTUBE CHANNEL
DO PROBLEMS I WOULD ASSUME THAT YOUR COURSE WOULD BE AT THE LEVEL OF KLEPPNER AND KOLENKOW OF NEWTONIAN MECHANICS BY AP FRENCH FIND OF THESE AND DO THE PROBLEMS
I'VE NEVER GOTTEN A BUT I'VE GOTTEN MANY EXAMS EVEN ON HARDER CLASSES NEVER REALLY ON SENIOR YEAR COURSES THOUGH MOST OF THE PHYSICS CLASSES REALLY ONLY REQUIRE YOU TO KNOW ONE THING AND KNOW IT WELL TYPICALLY YOU ONLY LEARN A MULTITUDE OF STUFF IN COURSES LIKE STATISTICAL MECHANICS THE JUNIOR SENIOR ONE NOT THE FRESHMAN ONE AND UNDERGRAD SOLID STATE CONDENSED MATTER

THUS LEARN THE ONE THING YOU NEED TO KNOW AND KNOW IT WELL ASSUMING IT IS FRESHMAN MECHANICS FOR MAJORS EVERYTHING IS TRIVIAL IS YOU KNOW HOW TO SOLVE THIS ONE PROBLEM FIND THE MOTION OF AN ARBITRARY SHAPE OF CONSTANT DENSITY WITH A FORCE VECTOR AT AN ARBITRARY ANGLE AND PLACE FOR BOTH CONSTANT AND SINUSOIDALLY VARYING FORCES IT SHOULD BE VERY SIMPLE YOU FIND THE MOMENT OF INERTIA AND CENTRE OF MASS VIA INTEGRALS AND JUST SOLVE THE PROBLEM BASED ON THAT ALSO OF COURSE KNOW THAT CONSERVATION OF ENERGY AND MOMENTUM EXISTS BUT THAT GOES IN ANY PHYSICS COURSE THE ONLY THING YOU MIGHT NEED TO KNOW ON TOP OF THE ONE THING WOULD PROBABLY BE THE PARALLEL AXIS THEOREM

OF COURSE AFTER YOU'RE SURE YOU KNOW ALL THAT PRACTISE
I SEE SOME GUESTS FROM OTHER SUBREDDITS CAUSING THROUGH THE THREAD WELCOME WE'RE GLAD TO HAVE YOU JUST A REMINDER WE VALUE CIVIL DISCUSSION KEEP IT FOCUSED ON THE TOPIC AND STAY AWAY FROM ATTACKS THANK YOU
ANY MAJOR HOLES

YES MANY BUT LET'S FOCUS ON ONE AS I READ THE PAPER I THINK THE DATA SHOW QUITE CLEARLY THAT THE DISPLACEMENT THE AUTHORS MEASURE IS DUE TO THERMAL EXPANSION NOT THRUST FROM THEIR CAVITY OF COURSE I DON'T HAVE MY HANDS ON THE APPARATUS AND SO CAN'T SAY THIS WITH CERTAINTY BUT I AM CONVINCED AND THINK YOU SHOULD BE TOO

IT'S ALL IN FIGURE I'VE MARKED IT UP HERE HETP PLEASE LOOK AT THE CALIBRATION PULSE THE BLUE PLOT BETWEEN WHERE I'VE MARKED ON AND OFFICIAL THAT SHOWS YOU HOW THEIR BALANCE BEAM RESPONDS TO AN APPLIED FORCE PLEASE TAKE SPECIAL NOTICE OF THE QUICK RESTORATION OF THE TRACE WHEN THE PULSE IS TURNED OFFICIAL SEE HOW IT JUST ZIPS BACK AFTER THE FORCE IS REMOVED THAT'S GOOD EXPERIMENTING RIGHT THERE THEY APPLY A KNOWN FORCE AND IT SHOWS HOW THEIR APPARATUS RESPONDS

NOW LOOK AT THE RF PULSE WHICH IS USED TO POWER THE EMDRIVE IT'S IN GOLD IN THE SAME FIGURE THE AUTHORS FOCUS ON THE BEGINNING OF THE RF PULSE BUT I WOULD LIKE YOU LOOK AT THE END WHERE I'VE MARKED IT NO RESPONSE TO SEE HOW THERE IS NO QUICK RESTORATION OF THE SPRING YES THE TRACE STARTS TO FALL BACK DOWN AGAIN BUT THAT IS TOO SLOW TO BE THE RESTORING ITSELF IN FACT IT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE WHAT YOU GET FROM SOMETHING THAT HEATED UP WHILE THE RF WAS ON AND IS NOW COOLING IT'S STRAIGHT OUT OF A TEXTBOOK

RATHER THAN A NEW EFFECT THE SIMPLE EXPLANATION IS THAT THE RF EQUIPMENT HEATS THEIR EQUIPMENT AND CHANGES THE EQUILIBRIUM POSITION OF THEIR I SHOULD SAY THAT THEY TRY TO EXPLAIN THIS AWAY IN THEIR LIST OF POSSIBLE ERRORS BUT THE PROOF IS RIGHT THERE IN THEIR OWN PLOTS ALMOST ALL OF THEM LACK THE QUICK RESTORATION THAT YOU SEE IN THE CALIBRATION PULSE

TL R THE AUTHORS HAVE BUILT A TO MEASURE THE FORCE WHEN THEY ENGAGE THE DRIVE THEY SAY THE COMPRESSES AND MAYBE YOU COULD BELIEVE THAT FROM THE PLOT BUT WHEN THEY TURN THE DRIVE OFF THE SPRING SHOULD SPRING BACK THEIR OWN PLOTS CLEARLY SHOW THAT IT DOESN'T THIS EVIDENCE IS VISIBLE IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEIR PLOTS

EDIT WHILE I'M AT IT I MIGHT AS WELL SHOW HOW THEIR ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN AWAY MY CRITICISM IN ACTUALITY ONLY FURTHER PROVES MY POINT THEY SAY THAT THE CONFIGURATION OF EQUIPMENT IS ARRANGED ON THE BALANCE BEAM SO AS TO MAKE THE RESPONSE SLOW FORGET THAT WHETHER FAST OR SLOW IT SHOULD BE THE SAME FOR CALIBRATION AND EMDRIVE THEN THEY SAY THAT IT USED TO BE FASTER IN A PREVIOUS ARRANGEMENT THEIR SO-CALLED SPLIT CONFIGURATION AND OFFER FIGURE AS PROOF SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR FIGURE HETP

SEE HOW THERE ARE LITTLE RIPPLES IN EACH EDGE OF THE CALIBRATION PULSE MARKED RINGING INDICATES UNDERDAMPING THOSE RIPPLES SHOW THAT THEIR SPRING SYSTEM IS UNDERDAMPED THAT'S GOOD YOU WANT THE SYSTEM TO RESPOND QUICKLY AND AS AND EXPERIMENTER YOU TRADE LITTLE RIPPLES FOR FAST RESPONSE TIME WELL NOW LOOK AT THE DRIVE PULSE SPECIFICALLY WHERE THE RF TURNS OFF MARKED NO RINGING MEANS NO SPRING RESTORATION SEE HOW THERE ARE NO RIPPLES THIS IS TOTALLY DAMNING EVIDENCE YOU COULD THROW OUT THE WHOLE EXPERIMENT BASED ON THIS ONE GRAPH THE LACK OF RINGING COMPLETELY RULES OUT THAT IT IS THE SPRING SYSTEM RESTORING ITSELF IN OTHER WORDS WHEN THE EMDRIVE IS ON IT DOESN'T STRETCH THE THEIR EXPERIMENT ACTUALLY PROVES THAT THE EMDRIVE MAKES ZERO THRUST

TL R E FIGURE CONCLUSIVELY SHOWS THAT WHATEVER IS MOVING WHEN THE EMDRIVE IS ON IS NOT THE DESIGNED TO MEASURE THE THRUST THEY ARE NOT MEASURING WHAT THEY THINK THEY'RE MEASURING

EDIT 2 WELL THAT BLEW UP I'VE GOT TO STEP AWAY FOR A WHILE AND DON'T KNOW WHEN I'LL BE BACK I'D LIKE TO LEAVE WITH JUST A FEW THINGS ONE WHITE SHOULD PUBLISH THE DATA I GOT A COMPLAINT THAT MY ARGUMENT WAS IF WE ALL HAD THE DATA WE COULD SHARE PYTHON NOTEBOOKS AND EVERYONE COULD SEE THE ANALYSIS AND MAKE QUANTITATIVE ARGUMENTS THERE'S NOT MUCH DATA SO I DON'T SEE A PROBLEM IT WOULD BE TO EVERYONE'S BENEFIT

SECOND HERE'S JUST A QUICK LIST OF IMPROVEMENTS I WOULD SUGGEST IF ANYONE IS GOING TO REPEAT THE EXPERIMENT IT WOULD ALLOW THE EXPERIMENTERS TO DIRECTLY REFUTE MY CRITICISMS IT'S JUST COPIED FROM ONE OF MY COMMENTS


CAPTURE TEMPERATURE DATA IN REAL TIME PUT T SENSORS ALL OVER THEIR BALANCE BEAM AND CAVITY THERMOCOUPLE ARE LIGHT AND CHEAP IT WOULDN'T BE HARD THIS WILL ALLOW THEM TO MAKE QUANTITATIVE STATEMENTS ABOUT THE THERMAL EXPANSION

MOVE AWAY FROM THE LINEAR THRUST BEARINGS AS THE FULCRUM OF THEIR BALANCE BEAM IT'S A SQUISHY LAYER OF MUSH THAT CAN COUPLE ORTHOGONAL MOTIONAL MODES

LOCK THE RF TO THE CAVITY WITH ACQUIRE ALL POWERS REJECTED ESPECIALLY

KEEP THE RF ON ALL THE TIME THIS KEEPS THE HEAT INPUT INTO THE APPARATUS MUCH MORE EVEN THAN IT IS NOW RIGHT NOW YOU BLAST IT ON LET IT COOL SWITCH THE RF BETWEEN THE CAVITY AND A STUB SO YOU CAN DO THE NULL MEASUREMENT IN PLACE DO THE SWITCHING AT A FAST FREQUENCY SO THAT YOU ARE

PULSING THE RF AND USE DETECTION EVERY SENSITIVE EXPERIMENT FIGHTS F NOISE PUT THE SIGNAL WHERE IT'S NOT SO NOISE THIS IS A STANDARD TECHNIQUE AND WILL GREATLY IMPROVE RATIO AND WOULD ALLOW THE USE OF AVERAGING TO IMPROVE
I'M NOT HAPPY WITH THE ENTIRE PARAGRAPH THAT STARTS WITH OPTIMAL TUNING

AND I'M REALLY NOT HAPPY WITH THIS

THE DISADVANTAGE TO THE SPLIT CONFIGURATION THAT LED TO ITS ABANDONMENT WAS THAT PERFORMING FORWARD AND REVERSE THRUST TESTING REQUIRED COMPLETE DISASSEMBLY AND REASSEMBLY OF THE RF SYSTEM WHEN SWITCHING THRUST DIRECTIONS WHICH PRECLUDED THE ABILITY TO ESTABLISH A FROZEN RF TUNING CONFIGURATION AND WAS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE INTENTION OF PERFORMING FORCE MEASUREMENT TESTING AT ANOTHER LOCATION USING ANOTHER FORCE MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ALSO AS INDICATED IN SEC II B TUNING THE THRUSTER TO GENERATE OPTIMAL THRUST WAS VERY DIFFICULT AND BREAKING CONFIGURATION WHEN SWITCHING FROM FORWARD TO REVERSE THRUST WAS NOT PRACTICAL

I READ THAT AS SAYING THEY COULDN'T KEEP THE ELECTRONICS ON THE OTHER HALF OF THE ARM AND SUCCESSFULLY SWITCH THE DIRECTION OF THE DRIVE AND PRODUCE THRUST WITHOUT I THINK I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY IT MIGHT BE SO HARD MICROWAVE CIRCUITS ARE VERY GEOMETRY SENSITIVE STILL MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO ELIMINATE THE ONE THING THAT IS OVERWHELMING THE MEASUREMENTS THE THERMAL EFFECTS

SO FOR SUCCESSFUL FORWARD REVERSE TESTS THE ELECTRONICS CONTAINING THE THINGS THAT THERMALLY HEAT UP AND DISTORT THE MEASUREMENTS WITH THE THERMAL SIGNATURE WERE ALWAYS ATTACHED TO THE DRIVE ELEMENT AND SO WHEN THE DRIVE WAS REVERSED THE ELECTRONICS WERE ALSO REVERSED

I'D REALLY LIKE TO SEE THE REVERSE RUN FOR FIGURE ALONG WITH THE DETAILS OF WHAT THE FOR THE REVERSE RUN ENTAILED AND WHAT THE RESULTS LOOKED LIKE WITHOUT

I AM HAPPY TO SEE A TINY SENTENCE IN THERE THAT SAYS IN FUTURE TESTING THEY INTEND TO CHANGE THE POSITION OF THE ELEMENTS THE HEARTSICK IN ORDER TO TRY AND MINIMIZE IT'S EFFECTS

DID THEY POST THEIR RAW DATA ANYWHERE ALL OF THE GRAPHS SHOWN EXCEPT FOR A COUPLE TINY CHOICE SEGMENTS ARE THEIR INTERPOLATED LINES AND I SEE BITS AND PIECES HERE AND THERE THAT MAKE ME THINK THEY DID SOMETHING WONKY WITH THE INTERPOLATION AT THE VERY START OF ALL THE SLOPES SPECIFICALLY I SEE DASHED ERROR BAR LINES EXTEND OUT TO THE LEFT WHY IS THAT THERE IF THE INTERPOLATION GOES ELSEWHERE

EDIT DID THEY DO ANY TESTING WITH A PERFECTLY SYMMETRICAL CYLINDER WITH DIELECTRIC AT BOTH ENDS THAT WOULD DISPLAY THE THERMAL EFFECT CLEARLY AND IF THE TUNING STILL WORKED WELL THEN YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT TUNING THE MICROWAVE CAVITY YOU'RE TUNING THE THERMAL EFFECTS

EDIT 2 I'M ALSO REALLY NOT HAPPY WITH FIGURE IF THERE WAS A THERMAL EFFECT ON THE NULL RUN THAT GENERATED A TORSION FORCE WHERE IS THE REVERSE EFFECT THE RETURN TO CENTER ONCE THE POWER WAS OFF AND THE DEVICE STARTS COOLING DOWN AND WHY DOES THE THERMAL EFFECT NEVER MAX OUT IF YOU HEAT SOMETHING UP AT SOME POINT IT COMES INTO THERMAL EQUILIBRIUM ENERGY IN EQUALS RADIATIVE OUT OKAY MAYBE WITH ONLY AND IN A VACUUM THE THING IS STILL HEATING UP LINEARLY BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE SOMETHING THAT SHOWS THAT THIS IS IN FACT THERMAL

I WONDER IF ANY OF THE PARTS OF THE APPARATUS ARE ACCUMULATING A STATIC CHARGE
A MAJOR HOLE IS THAT THE HYPOTHESIS THEY PUT OUT IN ANOTHER PAPER AND REFERENCE IN THIS ONE IS A MISHMASH OF QUANTUM FIELD THEORY JARGON TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT AND THROWN TOGETHER HAPHAZARDLY TO SOMEONE WHO HASN'T STUDIED QUANTUM FIELD THEORY THE EXPLANATION HAS THE APPEARANCE OF A REAL HYPOTHESIS BUT TO ANYONE WHO HAS EVEN TAKEN ONE SEMESTER OF AFT IT'S GIBBERISH FOR EXAMPLE THE PAPER THEY CITE AS AN EXPLANATION STARTS OFF WITH THIS

THE CURRENT VIEWPOINT OF THE QUANTUM VACUUM OR VACUUM STATE IS THAT IT IS AN IMMUTABLE STATE FOR ALL OBSERVERS AND SYSTEMS WITH NO STRUCTURE OR VARIATION THE CONCEPT OF THE VACUUM STATE IS TYPICALLY INTRO DEUCED AS A GROUND STATE OF A HARMONIC OSCILLATOR SO THE VIEWPOINT THAT IT IS IMMUTABLE IS REASONABLE HOW CAN THE VACUUM BEING THE GROUND STATE OF A HARMONIC OSCILLATOR BE ANYTHING OTHER THAN ZERO FOR ALL OBSERVERS WHAT IF HOWEVER THE VACUUM COULD BE POSITED TO BE A PLENUM THAT CAN BE SHOWN TO BE DEGRADABLE AND HAS THE CAPABILITY TO SUPPORT OR INTERACTIONS THAT ALLOW LOWER ENERGY GROUND STATES IT IS KNOWN FROM EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATION THAT THE VACUUM CAN EXHIBIT CHARACTERISTICS THAT CAN BEST BE ASSOCIATED WITH A DEGRADED VACUUM IN THE FORM OF THE CASIMIR FORCE

IF THIS SENTENCE SEEMS LIKE GIBBERISH IT'S BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS THEY SAY THE VACUUM IS ZERO IN CONVENTIONAL THEORIES BUT WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN ARE THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THE VACUUM EXPECTATION VALUE OF A FIELD THE ENERGY DENSITY THEY MIGHT AS WELL HAVE SAID THE VACUUM IS BLUE OR ZAPPOS SINCE THIS MAKES JUST AS MUCH SENSE AS WHAT THEY SAID

THEN THEY CLAIM THAT THERE CASIMERE FORCE IS SOMEHOW AT ODDS WITH OUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF QUANTUM FIELD THEORY DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT WAS PREDICTED FROM A QUANTUM FIELD THEORY CALCULATION LONG BEFORE IT WAS EXPERIMENTALLY SEEN

THEY ALSO CLAIM THERE IS A LOWER ENERGY STATE THEN THE GROUND STATE BUT IF THIS IS THE CASE WHY HASN'T THE VACUUM DECAYED INTO THIS STATE AND WHY DOES THIS DECAY ONLY HAPPEN ON THE EM DRIVE WHERE NOTHING NEW IS HAPPENING THE REST OF THE PAPER MAKES EVEN LESS SENSE THEN THE FIRST PART
THIS HAS BEEN A VERY GOOD DISCUSSION BUT ANYONE WHO'S FAMILIAR WITH EXPERIMENT DESIGN AND DATA ANALYSIS NOT TO MENTION AFT CAN PLAINLY SEE THIS PAPER IS NOT EVIDENCE OF THE EMDRIVE WORKING IT IS EVIDENCE OF POOR EXPERIMENTAL AND DATA ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES THE MOST GENEROUS THING ONE COULD SAY IS THAT IT'S INCOMPLETE BUT GIVEN THE QUALITY AND RESULTS OF THIS PAPER THE HISTORY OF THE AUTHORS AND THE HISTORY OF THE EMDRIVE AND ALL ASSOCIATED RESEARCH I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY WE CAN PUT THIS TO BED AND RELEGATE IT TO THE PATHOLOGICAL SCIENCE SECTION ALONG WITH COLD FUSION I THINK THIS WOULD BE THE CONSENSUS AMONG ACTUAL PHYSICISTS AND REGULARS TO THIS SUB WHICH INCLUDE ACTUAL PHYSICISTS WHAT SAY YOU U CARBONRODOFPHYSICS CAN WE NOT HAVE ANYMORE SUBMISSIONS ON THE EMDRIVE IN THIS SUB AND GET BACK TO REAL PHYSICS
I HAD HOPE THAT THEY'D FINALLY WRITE A PROFESSIONAL DOCUMENT BUT THEY HAVEN'T THIS THE FIRST ERROR IS GARBAGE IF UNDERGRAD LAB REPORT TRASH SEVERAL OF THEIR PLOTS DON'T RESPOND PROPERLY TO TURNING THEIR DEVICE ON AND OFFICIAL THEY AREN'T MEASURING A THRUST
HERE BUT EVEN I HAVE BEEN STRUCK OVER THE YEARS BY HOW LITTLE TANGIBLE SCIENCE HAS BEEN PRODUCED BY EAGLE WORKS AND HAROLD WHITE IN PARTICULAR BY NOW I ASSUME THAT A MUCH HIGHER QUALITY HIGHER POWER TEST ARTICLE COULD HAVE BEEN MACHINED AND TESTED FROM MY UNDERSTANDING MICROWAVE RESONANT CAVITIES ARE USUALLY MACHINED TO PRECISION TOLERANCE FROM SOLID COPPER RATHER THAN HASTILY ASSEMBLED IN A LIVING ROOM FROM WHAT APPEARS TO BE COMMERCIAL SHEET METAL I REALIZE TIGHT BUDGET CONSTRAINTS EXIST FOR THIS PROJECT BUT I SUSPECT THAT IS BECAUSE THE SMART MONEY HAS FOUND OTHER USES I WANT THIS TO BE REAL AS BADLY AS ANYONE BUT I'M FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO SUSPEND DISBELIEF SO MANY GREAT POSTS IN THIS THREAD BTW
I TAKE APART THIS PAPER ON A FEW MAJOR POINTS HERE

TL R THE AUTHORS HAVE SERIOUS FLAWS IN THEIR EXPERIMENT AND ENGAGE IN CRACKPOT JUSTIFICATIONS FOR THEIR FLAWED RESEARCH THE EMDRIVE IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF PATHOLOGICAL SCIENCE

EDIT WORDS
NO QUANTITATIVE TREATMENT OF SYSTEMATIC ERRORS
THE EXPERIMENT ITSELF HAS MANY ISSUES LEFT UNRESOLVED WHICH I OUTLINE HERE AS WELL
THE MAIN QUESTION IS IT PRECISE ENOUGH TO BE A REPLICATEABLE EXPERIMENT COULD IT BE RERUN
RATHER THAN A HOLE PER SAY I THINK THERE'S ALSO THE QUESTION OF WHY THEY DECIDED TO PUBLISH IN THAT JOURNAL I MEAN THEY HAVE A PAPER THAT IF ITS CLAIMS ARE VERIFIED BASICALLY SAYS THEY BROKE PHYSICS AND THEY DECIDED TO PUBLISH IT IN AN ENGINEERING JOURNAL ABOUT AERONAUTICS AND ASTRONAUTICS WHY WOULD WANT TO DO THAT
PAUL MARCH COMMENTS ON HIS TIME AT NASA EAGLEWORKS

TOPIC

FROM ITS INCEPTION THE EW LAB'S YEARLY BUDGET WAS ON A AND IT NEVER EXCEEDED PER YEAR FOR AND NEW TEST EQUIPMENT WITH EVERYTHING ELSE BEING BOOTLEGGED FROM NASA SURPLUS STORAGE AT JSC AFTER THE END OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE PROGRAM

THE OUTFIT DR WHITE WORKS FOR NASA JSC USED JSC DIVISION'S PART-TIME LABOR WHEN NEEDED OR COLLEGE SPONSORED STUDENT CO-OP HELP DURING THE FIRST YEARS OF THE LAB'S EXISTENCE TO HELP WITH THE EW LAB BUILDUP AND CALIBRATION

THEY ME IN MAY FROM A LAYOFF STATUS THAT STARTED BACK IN DECEMBER WHEN I GOT LAID OFF FROM THE ORION PROJECT AS ONLY A PART-TIME TEMPORARY EMPLOYEE WITH NO BENEFITS WITH JUST ENOUGH IN THE EW POT TO COVER MY BASE NASA HR WK CONTRACTOR SALARY FOR THE FIRST THREE YEARS AND THEN LESS AS MY TIME WAS SCALED BACK DOWN TO HOURS PER WEEK MAX FOR THE LAST MONTHS I WORKED AT THE EW

AND I WAS ALSO EXPECTED TO BUY SMALL PARTS OUT OF MY OWN CASH RESERVES AS WELL SO YOU DO THE MATHEMATICS

IT APPEARS THAT MOST MANAGERS AT JSC WANTED WHAT THE THRUSTER TECHNOLOGY COULD PROVIDE THEM BUT NONE OF THEM WANTED TO BE THE ONES PAYING FOR ITS DEVELOPMENT

HOWEVER AND MORE IMPORTANTLY OTHER THAN DR WHITE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO RISK THEIR REPUTATIONS IF IT DIDN'T WORK

WHAT ARE THE AUTHORS MOTIVES HERE DO THEY STAND TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ARE THEY PLANNING A FOLLOW-UP PAPER DISCUSSING HOLES IN THE SYSTEM I THINK IT WOULD BE FOOLISH TO DISMISS THIS AS STUPID PEOPLE DOING STUPID THINGS THEY HAVE PHYSICS PHS AFTER ALL
AT LEAST IT IS NOT PAY WALLED
I AM A BIT SKEPTICAL ON BASICALLY ALL OF SECTION BELLS INEQUALITY VIOLATION IS PRETTY ROBUST SO I AM UNCOMFORTABLE WITH HOW COMFORTABLE THE AUTHORS ARE TAKING THREE PAPERS ON PILOT WAVE THEORY AS THE EXPLANATION I THINK THEY SHOULD BE MORE CONSERVATIVE IN THEIR VIEW

ALSO I NEED TO REVIEW THE CITED PAPERS MORE CAREFULLY MAYBE THEY DO DISCUSS THE CASIMIR FORCE VIA PILOT WAVE THEORY ALTHOUGH I AM NOT SURE HOW YOU WOULD

MY PEER REVIEW GOES LIKE THIS THIS THING WILL STILL BE DEBATED AS FLUKE WHEN WE'LL BE EVERYWHERE IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM USING SPACESHIP WITH THESES DRIVES
I THINK PHYSICISTS ARE GOING TO DENY THE TECHNOLOGY TELL EVERYONE THAT IT WONT WORK UNTIL ELON MUSK SHOOTS A ROCKET TO PLUTO
WE WOULD NEED A BIOMECHANICS EXPERT TO WEIGH IN ON THIS BUT I'M PRETTY SURE THAT THE FOLLOW THROUGH DOES AFFECT THE SPEED OF THE BALL AS YOU RELEASE IT HUMAN MOVEMENT IS RATHER FLUENT SO IF YOU FLUB THE FOLLOW THROUGH YOU ALREADY START DOING THINGS WRONG EVEN BEFORE YOU RELEASE THE BALL
WE DO THE SAME IN ARCHERY THE POINT IS THAT BY NOT FOLLOWING THROUGH YOU WILL SUBCONSCIOUSLY MAKE CHANGES TO YOUR MOTION BEFORE THE BALL EVEN LEAVES YOUR HAND SLOWING DOWN BY FOLLOWING THROUGH YOUR MOTION AND ITS EFFECTS REMAIN MORE EASILY PREDICTABLE
YES IT WILL ELECTROLYSE NO THE GASES ARENT DANGEROUS
FOR HOUSEHOLD ALTERNATING CURRENT YES IT WILL ELECTROLYZE THE WATER

WITH DC CURRENT YOU GET OXYGEN COMING OFF ONE ELECTRODE AND HYDROGEN COMING OFF THE OTHER PLUS SOME EXTRA GASSES FROM WHATEVER IMPURITIES ARE IN THE WATER CHLORINE ETC THERE'S DEFINITELY AN EXPLOSION RISK FROM THAT IF YOU TRAP THEM BUT VENTING SHOULD BE MOSTLY SAFE

WITH AC YOUR ANODE AND CATHODE KEEP SWAPPING PLACES SO THEY'LL BE GENERATING BOTH HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN AND YOU WON'T HAVE ANY SENSIBLE METHOD OF SEPARATING THEM WHICH PROBABLY ISN'T HAPPENING IN A WATER HEATER ANYWAYS

THE MUCH BIGGER ISSUE IS ELECTRODE EROSION WHICH WILL START DUMPING WHATEVER IS IN YOUR HEATING ELEMENT AND LEECH IT INTO YOUR WATER THE IRON AND MANGANESE DON'T CONCERN ME VERY MUCH SAME WITH COPPER IN VERY SMALL AMOUNTS BUT CHROMIUM IS PRETTY MUCH UNIVERSALLY TOXIC AND REALLY NEEDS TO BE AVOIDED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE COMMERCIAL HEATING ELEMENTS USUALLY HAVE A CERAMIC COATING TO PREVENT THESE PROBLEMS
IGNORING THE OBVIOUS FACT THAT ONE CAN GET ELECTROCUTED EASILY BY THIS

PROBABLY A LOT LESS EASILY THAN YOU WOULD THINK IT'S NOT LIKE IN THE MOVIES WHERE IF YOU STEP INTO ELECTRIFIED WATER YOU GET ELECTROCUTED ELECTRICITY TAKES THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE

I WATCHED A VIDEO NOT THAT LONG AGO WHERE A GUY TOOK AN ELECTRIC CORD CUT IT AND STRIPPED THE THE TWO WIRES AT THE END AND THEN PLUGGED IT IN THEN HE DIPPED THE TWO WIRES INTO A CONTAINER OF WATER AFTER VERIFYING WITH A MULTIMETER HE STUCK HIS FINGERS IN THE WATER AND FELT NOTHING THE ELECTRICITY WAS TAKING A PRETTY DIRECT PATH BETWEEN THE TWO WIRES AND NOT DIFFUSING THROUGH THE WHOLE CONTAINER HE REALLY DIDN'T FEEL ANYTHING UNTIL HE STUCK A FINGER BETWEEN THE TWO WIRES AND EVEN THEN IT WAS JUST UNCOMFORTABLE
THE GASES ARE NOT DANGEROUS UNLESS YOU TRAP THEM THEORETICALLY THE GASES PRODUCED ARE HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN IN PRACTICE YOU GET ONLY HYDROGEN UNLESS THE SYSTEM IS SUPER CLEAN THE OXYGEN WILL OXIDIZE INTO SALTS AND DEPOSIT ON THE ELECTRODE RATHER THAN BUBBLING UP AS A GAS

THE BIGGER DANGER IS THAT YOU ARE DEFINITELY DISSOLVING METALS FROM THE ELECTRODES INTO THE WATER IF YOU RUN THIS FOR A DAY OR TWO WITH A A COPPER ELECTRODE FOR EXAMPLE YOUR WATER WILL TURN GREEN OR BLUE THAT AMOUNT OF DISSOLVED COPPER IONS ARE NOT GOOD TO INGEST AND CAN MAKE RIVERS AND LAKES TOXIC TO AQUATIC LIFE IF THEY ARE JUST DUMPED OUT THE TOXICITY LEVEL VARIES A LOT DEPENDING ON WHAT METAL USED IN THE ELECTRODES YOU SHOULD NOT BE DRINKING OR COOKING WITH WATER THAT IS HEATED THIS WAY IF IT IS ONLY USED FOR WASHING AND ITS NOT DONE FOR TOO LONG THEN IT IS LESS DANGEROUS
YES WE USE ELECTRONICS ALL THE TIME
IT'S THE CENTURY IT'S HARD NOT TO USE ELECTRONICS I RECENTLY USED A RASPBERRY PI FOR SOME GEOPHYSICS RESEARCH
THIS MAY BE LEGIT BUT IT SEEMS LIKE A POOR DEMONSTRATION TO ME SINCE THEY CHANGED THE RESONANT FREQUENCY OF THE SHIP BUT HAVE KEPT THE WAVE FREQUENCY CONSTANT NO SURPRISE THAT THE SHIP NO LONGER RESONATES WITH THE WAVES
AH YES TURNING THE SHIP UPSIDE DOWN MAKES IT MORE STABLE HOW HAVE WE NOT DISCOVERED THIS BEFORE
PARDON MY IGNORANCE BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE AND WHY IS IT A GOOD THING SEEMS INTERESTING BUT I DON'T SEE IT LOL THANKS
THIS VIDEO IS JUNK

AT SOME WAVE PERIODS THE FREE SURFACE EFFECT HELPS STABILIZE A SHIP AT OTHER WAVE PERIODS YOU'RE FUCKED
THIS DEMONSTRATION ALMOST COMPLETELY MISSES THE POINT WITH THE EFFECT LIQUIDS HAVE ON A CONTAINER

AS THE TANK MOVES FROM THE UPRIGHT THE LIQUID OR SEMI LIQUID IN THE TANK WILL SHIFT TO REMAIN UPRIGHT THIS WILL CAUSE A SHIFT IN THE CENTER OF GRAVITY AWAY FROM WHERE THE NATURAL CENTER OF GRAVITY IS FOR THE SHIP WHEN THE SHIP ROLLS BACK AND FORTH THESE CHANGES IN THE CENTER OF GRAVITY CAN CAUSE THE SHIP TO BECOME DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO CAPSIZING BY CREATING LONGITUDINAL PARTITIONS WITHIN THE TANK YOU PREVENT THE LARGE SHIFTS IN THE CENTER OF GRAVITY

THIS PHENOMENON IS KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE MARITIME INDUSTRY AS THE FREE SURFACE EFFECT AND MUCH THOUGHT IS GIVEN TO MITIGATING THE RISKS

THERE ARE SEVERAL FACTORS THAT NEED TO BE CONSIDERED WHEN EVALUATION THE TRANSVERSE STABILITY OF A SHIP FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT IS THE CENTER OF GRAVITY THIS IS MEASURED VERTICALLY FROM THE KEEL THE SECOND IS THE METACENTER WHICH IS ALSO MEASURED FROM THE KEEL THE METACENTER IS DEFINED AS THE POINT OF INTERSECTION BETWEEN A VERTICAL LINE THROUGH THE CENTER OF BUOYANCY OF A FLOATING BODY AND A VERTICAL LINE THROUGH THE NEW CENTER OF BUOYANCY WHEN THE BODY IS TILTED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE METACENTER AND CENTER OF GRAVITY IS KNOWN AS GM AND IS VITALLY IMPORTANT FOR SHIP STABILITY

THE GM OF A SHIP DETERMINES THE ROLLING PERIOD OF THE SHIP AS WELL AS WHETHER THE SHIP WILL BE STIFF SNAP ROLLING OR TENDER LONG SLOW ROLLS A LARGE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE CENTER OF GRAVITY AND THE METACENTER LARGE GM CAUSES THE SHIP TO BE STIFF WHILE A SMALL GM CAUSES THE SHIP TO BE TENDER IN ORDER FOR A SHIP TO REMAIN STABLE THE CENTER OF GRAVITY MUST BE BELOW THE METACENTER A NEGATIVE GM THE CENTER OF GRAVITY IS ABOVE THE METACENTER WILL CAUSE THE SHIP TO CAPSIZE SO THAT THE CENTER OF GRAVITY IS BELOW THE METACENTER AGAIN WHEN THE CENTER OF GRAVITY IS EQUAL TO THE METACENTER THE SHIP WILL ROLL OVER UNTIL IT COMES TO REST AT WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE ANGLE OF LOLL

THE EFFECT OF FREE SURFACE CAN EASILY BE CALCULATED AND IS KNOWN AS A VIRTUAL RISE IN THE CENTER OF GRAVITY IT IS CALCULATED USING SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING THE WIDTH OF THE TANK THE DENSITY OF THE CARGO AND SEVERAL CONSTANTS THIS VIRTUAL RISE WILL CASE A DECREASE IN GM CAUSING THE SHIP TO BECOME MORE TENDER AND POSSIBLY BRINGING THE SHIP NEAR CAPSIZING

THE DEMONSTRATION ABOVE CAPTURES A VERY PARTICULAR SET OF CONDITIONS THIS IS KNOWN AS SYNCHRONOUS ROLLING AND CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS TO A SHIP IF THE CYCLE IS NOT BROKEN THIS HAPPENS WHEN THE ROLLING PERIOD OF THE SHIP IS THE SAME AS THE PERIOD OF THE WAVES THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN VERY OFTEN THOUGH

THERE IS A DECENT EXPLANATION FOUND HERE

SOURCE I AM AN OFFICER ABOARD A TANKER WHICH MEANS I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR LOADING AND DISCHARGING THE CARGO THESE ARE CALCULATIONS I DO EVERY DAY

TL R THE DEMO ONLY ACCOUNTS FOR VERY SPECIFIC CONDITIONS WHICH DO NOT HAPPEN OFTEN ENOUGH TO MERIT A DESIGN CHANGE
I'VE SEEN THESE CHANNELS PATTERN IN MANY GAS TANK IN CARS SAME PRINCIPLE WHERE THE LIQUID IS STABILIZED SO THE FUEL PUMP DOESN'T SUCK UP AIR POCKETS

IT ALWAYS IMPRESSED ME I THOUGH I SHOULD SHARE
I'M NOT TANKER CAPTAIN SCIENTIST OR MARINE

IF THIS IS THE CROSS SECTION OF A SHIP ISNT THE WATER SUPPOSED TO BE OUTSIDE OF THE SHIPS HULL


I DONT GET WHAT THIS GIF IS TEACHING OR SAYING TO ME
IT LOOKS LIKE PHASE IS THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO CONFIGURATIONS IN COMPARTMENTALIZED MODE THE ROLL OF THE BOAT IS OUT OF PHASE WITH THE WAVES WHILE NOT AN NAVAL ARCHITECT I GUESS THIS WOULD BE LESS LIKELY TO CAPSIZE
AND THE SHIP COULD PUMP IN OR PUMP OUT HOWEVER MUCH WATER IS NEEDED FOR THE RESONANCE OF THE PENDULUM SWING NEAT
SO JUST GET RID OF THE BAFFLES
I JUST REMEMBER THAT OLD GUY IN THE TANKER IN THE MOVIE WATER WORLD THE GUY SPITS AT HIM THEN HE DIES
FROM WHAT I HAVE UNDERSTOOD IN TANKER DESIGN IS THAT THE MORE COMPARTMENTS TO SEPARATE THE FLUID INSIDE THE LESS FREE SURFACE MOVEMENT WHICH CAN CHANGE THE CENTRE OF MASS TOO MUCH THIS WAS INTRODUCED AS TANKERS HAD CAPSIZED DUE TO THE MOVEMENT OF LIQUID INSIDE PUSHING THE SHIP PAST IT'S LIMITS WHEN ROLLING

I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE GIF SHOWS THE OPPOSITE IS IT BECAUSE THE CONTAINER IS NOT FLOATING
I'M SURE SOMEONE HAS ALREADY MENTIONED IT BUT WHEN THE WAVE SPEED MATCHES THE FREQUENCY OF THE STABILIZATION CHAMBER YOU'RE IN FOR A VERY BAD TIME
SOOSOO

ROLL THE SHIP OVER AND IT WILL BE MORE STABLE UPSIDE DOWN
THAT WASN'T A GOOD MODEL OF EITHER PETROLEUM OR INCIDENT WAVES

IT SHOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW INFORMATION FROM THE TEST IS USED FOR IMPROVEMENTS IN DESIGN
I BELIEVE THIS WAS THE SAME IDEA WITH THE TITANIC
DO YOU HAVE A SPECIALTY OR SOME KIND OF SPECIFIC INTEREST
IT DEPENDS A LOT ON WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
IN CASE YOU WANT TO WORK ON PARTICLE OR CONDENSED MATTER THEORY THE PROJECTS WILL MOST LIKELY BE LIMITED BY THE AMOUNT OF QUANTUM FIELD THEORY EXPOSURE YOU HAD

I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR THE EUROPEAN END OF THE SPECTRUM BUT FROM MY EXPERIENCE PROFESSORS ARE OFTEN HAPPY IF YOU APPROACH THEM TO DO SOME SORT OF PROJECT ESPECIALLY IF YOU DONT EXPECT THEM TO PAY YOU IT WORKED OUT PRETTY WELL FOR ME TWICE

IN CASE YOU DONT WANT TO GO TOO DEEP INTO AFT I KNOW FROM SECOND HAND EXPERIENCE THAT THERE IS ALSO A LOT OF REALLY EXCITING WORK HAPPENING IN THE REALM OF QUANTUM CHEMISTRY THAT WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO KEEP YOU BUSY JUST WITH MORE QUANTUM AND LESS FIELDS
WHAT'S YOUR MATHEMATICS BACKGROUND WHAT MODULES COURSES HAVE YOU TAKEN SO FAR
ISING MODEL CAN BE A GOOD PROJECT NOT QUITE FLUID DYNAMICS BUT CAN RAISE THE PROBLEM OF HOW TO SIMULATE A LARGE SYSTEM WITHOUT SIMULATING A LARGE AMOUNT OF PARTICLES
LATTICE GAS AUTOMATON COULD BE A GOOD WAY TO GET INTO FLUIDS IF THAT COMES TOO EASILY YOU COULD EXTEND TO LATTICE BOLTZMANN METHODS

THE BTW SANDPILE MODEL COULD ALSO BE A FUN ONE BUT YOU'D HAVE TO DO MORE THAN JUST SIMULATION IN THAT CASE SINCE IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE TO IMPLEMENT
YOU CAN'T USE THE PHOTON TWICE SO TO SPEAK IGNORE PHOTONS LET'S CONSIDER BILLIARD BALLS IF YOU FIRST TAKE ITS MOMENTUM MAKING IT GO TO REST YOU CAN'T TAKE ITS ENERGY AFTERWARDS
DISCLAIMER I DON'T HAVE DIRECT EXPERIENCE HERE I'M JUST THROWING OUT IDEAS I'M SURE CERTAIN MATERIALS WOULD BREAK AT A CERTAIN PRESSURE GLASS WOULDN'T BE A GOOD BET I WOULDN'T THINK BECAUSE VARYING COMPOSITION WOULD RESULT IN VARIATION IN THE TOLERANCE FOR PRESSURE BUT HIGH PURITY SAMPLES OF SOMETHING LIKE GRAPHITE MIGHT DO BETTER DEPENDING ON THE SETUP OF THE PRESS YOU COULD ALSO USE A COMPRESSIBLE BALLOON OF NITROGEN OR EVEN AIR AND THE IDEAL GAS LAW TO RELATE A KNOWN CHANGE IN VOLUME TO AN EXPECTED PRESSURE THEN COMPARE TO THE MEASURED VALUE
I THINK SOME FORM OF A LOAD CELL WOULD BE THE MOST COMMON

WIKI

EDIT OR JUST PUT A SECOND CALIBRATED PRESSURE GAGE IN THE HYDRAULICS
HAS A LIST OF THINGS TO LEARN WITH SOME RECOMMENDED READING FOUND HERE
TWO BOOKS I'D RECOMMEND FOR THE MAIN GOALS AT HAND ARE QUANTUM FIELD THEORY FOR THE GIFTED AMATEUR LANCASTER BLUNDELL OXFORD AND A FIRST COURSE IN STRING THEORY ZWIEBACK CAMBRIDGE THE FIRST OF THESE IS AIMED AT SOMEONE WITH A SECOND YEAR UNDERGRADUATE IN PHYSICS UK BUT IF YOU TOOK THE TIME TO READ A BOOK ON QM PERHAPS GRIFFITHS OR BINNEY SKINNER THEN THAT WOULD BROADEN YOUR KNOWLEDGE SUFFICIENTLY AND BE USEFUL IN UNDERSTANDING THE CONCEPTS IT'S PRESENTED IN A VERY FRIENDLY WAY AND SEEMS IDEAL TO YOUR NEEDS CLEAR AND RICH IN CONTENT BUT NOT AFRAID TO HOLD YOUR HAND A BIT THE SECOND IS I THINK ADAPTED FROM THE AUTHOR'S RELATIVELY RECENTLY INTRODUCED UNDERGRAD COURSE IN STRING THEORY AT MIT AND IS A BIT MORE TEXTBOOK I THINK AGAIN IN ORDER TO BROADEN YOUR PHYSICS KNOWLEDGE IN PREPARATION I'D READ THE FIRST

IF YOU'RE AFTER A TREE THEN I'D SAY

FOUNDATIONS QM MAYBE SOME STAT MECH LANDAU LIFSHITZ SOME SPECIAL RELATIVITY FOR FAMILIARITY

AFT QFTGA REFERENCED AGAINST PESKIN SCHROEDER P S IS I THINK HARDCORE BUT USEFUL FOR A MORE RIGOROUS APPROACH

STRING THEORY ZWIEBACK AS MENTIONED PERHAPS ANOTHER REFERENCE TEXT ZWIEBACK HAS SHORT SECTIONS AT THE BEGINNING ON RELATIVITY ELECTROMAG QM GRAVITY BUT THEY'RE MORE REVISION BASED I FEEL

ABOVE ALL GOOD LUCK IT'S A HUGE TASK TO TEACH YOURSELF THESE THINGS EFFECTIVELY WITHOUT NECESSARILY A PHYSICS BACKGROUND IF THERE'S SOMETHING YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND TRY YOUR BEST TO TEASE IT OUT OR LOOK IT UP AND WORK THROUGH IT
FOR AFT TRY QUANTUM FIELD THEORY DEMYSTIFIED IT'S VERY COMPREHENSIVE IN TERMS OF ITS DERIVATIONS HE DOESN'T LEAVE MANY STEPS OUT SO IT'S VERY EASY TO FOLLOW IF YOU ARE INEXPERIENCED BUT HAVE SOME FACILITY WITH MATHEMATICS IT DOESN'T CONTAIN ANY CD OR RENORMALIZATION AND TAKES THE CANONICAL RATHER THAN PATH INTEGRAL APPROACH BUT IT IS EXCEPTIONALLY CLEAR IT WILL GIVE YOU A GOOD FIRST GOOD LOOK AT THE GAUGE GROUP CONCEPT AND THEORY YOU'LL GET A GOOD IDEA OF WHAT A AFT IS

IF YOU REALLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND AFT IN GENERAL THEN YOU NEED A TEXT THAT TREATS RENORMALIZATION AND EFFECTIVE FIELD THEORY AND THIS IS HEAVY GOING IF YOU ARE UP TO THAT CHALLENGE THEN ANY OF THE GOOD STANDARD TEXTS ON AFT LIKE SREDNICKI OR ZEE ETC WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH

IF YOU HAVE THE TIME FREDDY AFT NOT AFT ALTHOUGH THAT IS CERTAINLY INTERESTING ON THE PERIMETER INSTITUTE WEBSITE HERE SELECT THE CORE TAB IS VERY VERY GOOD IF YOU NEED SOME REFRESHER COURSES THEIR FRONT TAB HAS SOME LECTURES ON THE BASIC TECHNIQUES YOU'LL NEED

EDIT I MOSTLY LEARNED BY GOOGLING LECTURE NOTES AND WORKING THROUGH THEM THOUGH BUT I HAD A FAIRLY SOLID BACKGROUND IN QM AND MATHEMATICS
MAYBE IT'S POSSIBLE BUT IT WILL BE DIFFICULT I AM NOT AN EXPERT IN STRING THEORY OR AFT SO I CAN'T GIVE YOU ADVICE I HAVE A PHD IN PHYSICS BUT OF THE MORE TRADITIONAL QUANTUM MECHANICS VARIETY PLUS I AM YEARS RUSTY

MY FEELING IS THE GULF BETWEEN THE AVERAGE PHYSICIST AND A STRING THEORIST IS AS BIG AS THE GULF BETWEEN THE AVERAGE LAYPERSON AND THE PHYSICIST
YOU ACTUALLY HAVE SOME PRETTY GOOD QUALIFICATIONS FOR THIS ONE WAY TO UNDERSTAND AFT IS TO WORK YOUR WAY THROUGH QM TO END ON QUANTUM MECHANICS THIS IS FOR EXAMPLE DONE WELL IN SAKURAI NAPOLITANO

A GREAT RESOURCE IS QUANTUM FIELD THEORY FOR THE GIFTED AMATEUR WHICH SOUNDS LIKE IT IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED


I STARTED WITH GRIFFITHS PARTICLE PHYSICS THEN MOVED ON TO AFT DEMYSTIFIED AFTER THAT YOU PROBABLY HAVE A GOOD BACKGROUND TO DEAL WITH PARTICLE PHYSICS BUT ITS NOT ENOUGH MY PLAN IS STUDENT FRIENDLY AFT NEXT AFTER THAT HIT THE AS NEEDED

IF YOU DON'T LIKE HITTING EM BOOKS REAL HARD THEN YOU CAN FOLLOW THESE STEPS
LWFAABRAHOS T

THOUGH I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WILL WORK BUT LOOKS PRETTY SOLID I WILL TRY IT OUT SOONER OR LATER

EDIT FORGOT TO TELL YOU I ACTUALLY DISCOURAGE YOU TO START WITH AFT FOR THE GIFTED AMATEUR YOU WON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL HE IS TALKING ABOUT IN THE BEGINNING UNLESS YOU HAVE A LITTLE BACKGROUND IN PARTICLE PHYSICS WHICH IS WHY I RECOMMEND GRIFFITHS FIRST ESPECIALLY CHAPTERS ON DIRAC EQUATION FEYNMAN DIAGRAMS SYMMETRY AND GAUGE THEORIES BEING THE MOST IMPORTANT ONES I'M FOLLOWING THE METHOD ON THE VIDEO THOUGH LOOKS LIKE IT'S WORKING BLAZING THROUGH AS WE SPEAK
MY ADVICE IN READING IS GRAVITATION BY MISNER THORNE WHEELER FOR GRAVITY AND TOPOLOGY THEN GRIFFITHS QM AND ELEMENTARY PARTICLES SO YOU GET THE TASTE FOR AFT THEN SCHWARTZ AFT AFTER THAT PESKIN AND SCHROEDER AND WEINBERG VOL AND 2 DI FRANCESCO AFT WITH WEINBERG VOLUME SHOULD BE SUITABLE FOR LEARNING AFT AND SAFT AND TAFT AFTER THAT YOU COULD START WITH ZWIEBACK FOLLOWED BY POLCHINSKI VOLUME AND 2
THE REFERENCE IS GREEN SCHWARZ AND WITTEN FOR STRING THEORY BUT BECKER BECKER AND SCHWARZ IS ALSO VERY GOOD
THAT'S A PLAN FOR SEVERAL YEARS BUT IF YOU ARE VERY INTERESTED AND WORK HARD ENOUGH YOU WILL UNDERSTAND ENOUGH TO SATISFY YOUR THIRST
REALISTICALLY IT IS NOT A FIELD
WHAT'S THE POINT IF YOU'RE NOT PLANNING TO DO RESEARCH IN STRING THEORY WHY LEARN STRING THEORY ABOVE A POP SCI LEVEL
IT ALL COUNTS
INCLUDE IT ON YOUR RESUME THE WAY I DO IT IS TO INCLUDE A SHORT BLURB ABOUT THE DIFFERENT PRESENTATIONS I'VE MADE AND THEN LIST IT UNDER A SECTION CALLED CONFERENCE CONTRIBUTIONS MY FORMAT IS

FIRST INITIAL LAST NAME TITLE OF POSTER OR POWERPOINT AEU CONFERENCE NAME OF UNIVERSITY MONTH AND YEAR CITY STATE
I LOVE THE LITTLE STIRLING ENGINES THAT YOU CAN PUT ON YOUR CUP OF TEA TO WATCH THEM GO IF YOU LIVE IN A COLD AREA IT MIGHT EVEN RUN JUST ON THE HEAT OF YOUR HAND EAST G
IF IT'S A GIFT FOR SOMEONE YOU ARE WILLING SOME MONEY ON THEN I THINK YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH A TELESCOPE FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN SCIENCE ONES ONES START FROM AROUND DOLLARS I BELIEVE
THOSE NIXIE TUBES ARE COOL
TOY GYROSCOPES ARE FUN
YOU CAN BUY LICHTENBERG FIGURES ANYWHERE FROM TO
ASSUMING THEIR INSTITUTION DOESN'T ALREADY HAVE IT A MATHEMATIC SUBSCRIPTION
TO A CERTAIN EXTENT YES YOU WILL PROBABLY GET MORE OUT OF A TIER RESEARCH SCHOOL OVER AN UNDERFUNDED NEW PHYSICS PROGRAM YOU'LL STILL DO THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT IVEY LEAGUE GUYS ARE DOING BUT YOU'LL GET A BETTER EXPERIENCE FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF RESEARCH OPTIONS
IF YOU WIND UP PURSUING A CAREER IN PHYSICS RESEARCH IT SEEMS THAT WHERE YOU GET YOUR PHD MATTERS A LOT MORE THAN WHERE YOU GET YOUR UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE IF YOU DON'T WORK IN PHYSICS RESEARCH THEN THAT'S PROBABLY NOT THE CASE
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THE POSSIBILITY OF A RESEARCH CAREER YOU WILL NEED TO GO TO GRADUATE SCHOOL IN THAT CASE YOUR CHOICE OF UNDERGRADUATE INSTITUTION WON'T MATTER AS MUCH AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A WAY TO START DOING SOME RESEARCH AND GET GOOD GRADES CU BOULDER OR ANOTHER DECENT STATE SCHOOL WOULD BE A GOOD CHOICE YOUR CHOICE OF GRADUATE SCHOOL WILL MATTER A LOT MORE SINCE IT WILL DETERMINE WHO YOU WORK WITH AND WHAT RESOURCES YOU HAVE ACCESS TO
ALL THAT REALLY MATTERS IS FINDING SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU CAN SUCCEED AND CAN POSSIBLY GET IN ON SOME RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES DOES GOING TO MIT OFFER CERTAIN ADVANTAGES YES ARE THOSE ADVANTAGES WORTH CHOOSING THEM OVER A DIFFERENT SCHOOL MORE FITTING TO YOUR PERSONAL LEARNING STYLE NUMBER
ASAP SCIENCE HAS A DETAILED AND THOUGHT PROVOKING ANSWER BACKED UP BY STATISTICS TO THIS QUESTION


I ATTENDED A SHITTY COLLEGE BUT ALSO HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE OF SPENDING SOME TIME AT A REALLY GOOD COLLEGE AS WELL

IN TERMS OF CLASSES THERE WON'T BE A HUGE DIFFERENCE YOU'LL GENERALLY BE WORKING FROM THE SAME TEXTBOOKS AND WILL GET A VARIETY OF PROFESSORS SOME WHO ARE REALLY GOOD AND SOME WHO ARE JUST THERE TO DO RESEARCH BUT ALSO HAVE TO BEGRUDGINGLY TEACH CLASSES

IF YOU PLAN ON GETTING INVOLVED IN RESEARCH A MORE PRESTIGIOUS SCHOOL WILL LIKELY HAVE MORE LABS BIGGER BETTER LABS WITH BIG TELESCOPES AND PARTICLE ACCELERATORS THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T HAVE PERFECTLY GOOD LABS AT LESS PRESTIGIOUS SCHOOLS IT JUST MEANS YOU LIKELY WON'T HAVE AS MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF RESEARCH TO GET INVOLVED WITH

AND OF COURSE IT'S MORE IMPRESSIVE WHEN YOU CAN SAY YOU GRADUATED FROM SOME PLACE PEOPLE HAVE HEARD OF
IT MATTERS A LITTLE BIT BUT NOT IN A MAKE-OR-BREAK WAY IF YOU ATTENDED A TOP INSTITUTION AND HAD COMPARABLE GRADES POST-GRADUATE OPPORTUNITIES WOULD BE A LITTLE EASIER TO GET
SHORT ANSWER SORT OF
LONG ANSWER YEAH I GUESS SO

TL R MORE PRESTIGIOUS SCHOOLS AND PHYSICS DEPARTMENTS HAVE MORE CONNECTIONS RESOURCES THE ACTUAL EDUCATION YOU ARE RECEIVING IS SIMILAR IF YOU CAN MAKE YOUR WAY AT A PUBLIC UNI AND DO SOME AWESOME RESEARCH AKA GET PUBLISHED THEN YOU LIKELY WON'T HAVE A PROBLEM BUT IT'S EASIER TO DO THAT AT MORE NOTABLE USIS


YES ABSOLUTELY IT DOES ESPECIALLY FOR AND CUMULATIVE FIELDS

THE SAME PERSON WITH THE SAME INTELLECT WILL HAVE A MARKEDLY DIFFERENT ACADEMIC SOCIAL AND ALUMNI EXPERIENCES AND OPPORTUNITIES AT DIFFERENT TIERS OF UNIVERSITY

THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT YOU GET FROM AN IVY LEAGUE DIPLOMA AND A SCHOOL WHICH DOESN'T HAVE AN IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED WORLDWIDE NAME ON YOUR DIPLOMA IS COLLOQUIALLY REFERRED TO AS PRIVILEGE

THAT'S THE MACRO POV THE MICRO POV IS WHEN YOUR CV GOES ACROSS DESK AND ONE BRINGS TO MIND DAMAN OR UNI OF HAS A PHYSICS PROGRAM IS HUGE IFF YOU DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF INTELLECT THAT CERN HIRES

THAT INTELLECT COULD BE A MECHANIC AND CHANGE THE WORLD KINDA LIKE THE MECHANIC WHO WAS THE MECHANIC WHO BUILT THE ELECTROMECHANICAL COMPUTER AT THE AMERICAN CERN AT PRINCETON
IF YOU WISH TO USE PHYSICS TO WORK IN A BANK I SUGGEST YOU GO ONTO SOME OF THE BANK APPLICATION PAGES AND TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT UNIVERSITIES APPEAR IN THE DROP DOWN LIST
NUMBER IN FACT THEY ARE LARGELY OVERPRICED

I AM CURRENTLY A FRESHMAN AT A UNIVERSITY FINALS ARE COMING AROUND THE CORNER AND I WOULD LIKE SOME BOOK RECOMMENDATIONS TO PRACTICE ON MY SKILLS I WOULD LIKE TO USE THESE BOOK WHEN I AM ON BREAK SO I DO NOT GET BORED WE ARE CURRENTLY LEARNING OSCILLATIONS WHICH IN MY OPINION IT IS A BIT DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW ALONG I USE THE MIT ACW WEBSITE WHICH IS EXTREMELY HELPFUL I ALSO HAVE THE SOLVED PHYSICS PROBLEMS WHICH I CAM CURRENTLY WORKING THROUGH IT MY SKILLS ARE MODERATE MEANING I UNDERSTAND THE BASIC PART OF THE CONCEPTS BUT I JUST NEED AN EXTRA PUSH TO FULLY UNDERSTAND IT ALSO ANY GOOD BOOKS TO READ ABOUT BLACK HOLES AND GALAXY FORMATION THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO STUDY IN ANY RECOMMENDATIONS THANKS

CAN ANYONE RECOMMEND A BOOK ABOUT PARTICLE PHYSICS FROM A DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY TOPOLOGY VIEWPOINT GOES INTO DETAIL ABOUT LIE GROUPS WHEN TALKING ABOUT GAUGE THEORIES ETC
IT WOULD BE REALLY COOL IF ANYONE KNOWS SUCH A BOOK THAT TOUCHES ON THE HISTORY OF THE THEORY AS WELL KIND OF LIKE PRINCIPLE BY DONNA GREAT BOOK
I AM GOING TO TEACH MYSELF QUANTUM MECHANICS SOON I HAVE COMPLETED CALCULUS WITH STEWART AND AM ABOUT TO COMPLETE CLASSICAL MECHANICS BY TAYLOR WHICH INCLUDES LAGRANGIAN AND HAMILTONIAN MECHANICS SEEING AS I AM LACKING IN KNOWLEDGE OF PDES LINEAR ALGEBRA AND PROBABILITY I FIGURED I WOULD PICK UP MARY MATHEMATICAL METHODS BOOK AND WORK THROUGH THOSE CHAPTERS BEFORE READING A QUANTUM BOOK SHANKAR PROBABLY DOES THIS SOUND LIKE ENOUGH FOR QM OR SHOULD I BE READING SEPARATE BOOKS ON LINEAR ALGEBRA AND PDES RESPECTIVELY TO GAIN MORE DEPTH
GOOD EVENING EVERYONE
I'M CURRENTLY IN SCHOOL FOR RADIOLOGIC TECHNOLOGY AND AM JUST FINISHING UP MY FIRST SEMESTER OF PHYSICS I DON'T HAVE A SCIENCE BACKGROUND MY DOCTORATE IS IN MUSIC BUT AM GREATLY ENJOYING THE MATERIAL AND SEEM TO BE GRASPING THE BASICS PRETTY WELL FOR SEVERAL YEARS I'VE BEEN INTERESTED IN TESLA COILS AND BECAUSE OF A PHYSICS PROJECT REQUIREMENT I HAD AN EXCUSE TO FINALLY BUILD A SLAYER EXCITER NOT A TESLA COIL BUT NONETHELESS THE BUILD WAS A TON OF FUN I'M NOW INTERESTED IN BUILDING ACTUAL TESLA COILS BUT I WANT TO LEARN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ABOUT THE PHYSICS BEHIND THEM BEFORE STARTING I'M ALSO INTERESTED IN LEARNING HOW TO HANDLE HIGH AMOUNTS OF ENERGY SAFELY I'M WONDERING IF ANY OF YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS AS TO WHERE I AS A BEGINNER COULD START ANY INSIGHT WOULD BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL AND APPRECIATED

FROM WHAT I HEAR YOU REALLY HAVE TO DECIDE WEATHER YOU WANT TO WORK IN A JOB DIRECTLY RELATING TO ASTRO THEORETICAL PHYSICS IF YOU DO YOU SHOULD PROBABLY PURSUE A GRADUATE DEGREE AND THE JOB PROSPECTS AREN'T TOO GOOD UNLESS YOU'RE REALLY GOOD HOWEVER IF YOU'RE OKAY WITH DOING THINGS NOT RELATED TO PHYSICS THOSE ARE GREAT DEGREES THAT SHOW EMPLOYERS YOU'RE VERY SMART AND GOOD AT SOLVING PROBLEMS SO YOU HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS OPEN
TECHNICAL CONSULTING

THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO ME ANYWAY I'M ENGINEERING PHYSICS THO
DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU WANT TO DO I FEEL LIKE PHYSICS IS GREAT TRAINING FOR LOTS OF TECHNICAL FIELDS THERE AREN'T MANY PROBLEMS IN PHYSICS THAT ARE EXACTLY SOLVABLE WITH PEN AND PAPER ANYMORE SO YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHERE TO MAKE APPROXIMATIONS AND THAT'S GOOD TRAINING FOR LIFE

THERE'S MORE OUT THERE THAN ACADEMIA I AM A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER IN A THE SPACE INDUSTRY
TEACHING IS THE SAFER WAY TO GET A JOB IN PHYSICS
ACADEMIA MOSTLY YOU STILL HAVE TO TRAVEL A LOT SOURCE MY THEORETICAL PHYSICS PROF
FIRST IT MAYBE GOOD TO DEFINE WHAT SHOCKWAVE EXACTLY ARE WE TALKING HERE THEN IT MIGHT BE GOOD TO DEFINE WHAT EXACTLY HYPERSONIC MEANS FOR STUFF LIKE MACH I CAN'T REALLY SEE IT HAVING ANY EFFECT

IF YOU'RE A METEOR ABOUT AS BIG AS A GRAIN OF SAND GOING AT KM S KILOMETERS PER SECOND ABOUT MACH YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SOME FUNKY PHYSICS IF YOU'RE GOING JUST FROM THE KINETIC ENERGY YOU WOULD HAVE SOMEWHERE AROUND JOULES PER GRAMMAR HITTING THE ATMOSPHERE EVEN AT HIGH ALTITUDES THERE ARE METEORS AS HIGH AS BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE ONES YOU SEE FROM EARTH ARE KM IN HEIGHT WHERE THE ATMOSPHERE DENSITIES ARE VERY LOW THEY WOULD STILL BE DENSE ENOUGH TO VAPORIZE AND IONIZE THE SURFACE MATERIAL OF THE METEOROID AND DISSOCIATE AND IONIZE THE SURROUNDING ATMOSPHERIC GAS THIS IS KNOWN AS ABLATION OIK DID SOME CALAS ABOUT THIS WAY BACK IN SOUTH

THERE'S NOT REALLY A LOT KNOWN ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENS IN ABLATION AS MODERN THEORIES TEND TO HAVE A BIT DIFFERENT APPROACHES DEPENDING ON THE MASS AND DIMENSIONS OF THE METEOROID IT'LL EITHER SLOW DOWN AND STOP OR MOVE ON IN WHERE THE ATMOSPHERE IS A BIT DENSER AT THAT POINT YOU'RE STILL MOVING SO FAST AIR CAN'T GET OUT OF THE WAY FAST ENOUGH SO GETS COMPRESSED AND FORMS A BOW WAVE IN FRONT OF THE METEOROID

THE OUTER LAYERS MANY TIMES THE METEOROID SIZE ARE STILL PLASMA AND THEY GLOW BRIGHTLY BUT IT IS SAID THAT ONLY ABOUT TO PER CENT OF THE ENERGY IS DISSIPATED IN THE VISIBLE SPECTRUM THESE ARE VERY ODDBALL APPROX NUMBERS MENTIONED JUST ABOUT EVERYWHERE TRY HANDBOOK FOR VISUAL METEOR OBSERVERS FROM INTERNATIONAL METEOR ORGANIZATION FOR DETAILS IF ONLY TO GOES ON VISIBLE LIGHT THEN THE MAJORITY OF THE ENERGY MIST DISSIPATE AS THERMAL INFRARED UV POSSIBLY BRAYS AND SO ON

SO THE PROCESS OF ABLATION NOW TAKES A BIT DIFFERENT FORM WHERE THE PRESSURE AND RADIATION ARE THE ONES STRIPING MATERIALS FROM THE METEOR AND NOT THE MECHANICAL METHOD OIK USED THIS IS SLOWER THAN THE OIK APPROACH BECAUSE THE COMPRESSED AIR IN BETWEEN THE METEOROID AND THE PLASMA IS IN A SENSE SHIELDING THE METEOROID BODY

SO IN CONCLUSION SPEEDS WITH SMALL MASSES MIGHT HAVE THAT EFFECT
PROGRAMS THAT ARE SMALL BUT NOT THAT SMALL OFTEN SCHOOLS WITH NO GRAD PROGRAM HAVE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNDERGRADS
REED IS A GREAT UNDERGRAD FOR PHYSICS GRIFFITHS STILL TEACHES CLASSES EVERY NOW AND THEN AND THE REGULAR PROFS ARE GREAT
LOOK FOR A SCHOOL WITHOUT A PHYSICS GRADUATE PROGRAM GENERALLY THIS WILL MEAN LOOKING AT SMALLER SCHOOLS AND THEY MAY NOT HAVE SUPER IMPRESSIVE NAMES MIT CAL TECH ETC BUT THEY WILL OFFER YOU THE OPPORTUNITIES YOU NEED

WHAT SORT OF JOB ARE YOU LOOKING TO PREPARE FOR
THERE'S AMO ATOMIC MOLECULAR OPTICAL PHYSICS BUT BASICALLY ANY AREA OF PHYSICS WILL INVOLVE ELECTROMAGNETISM IN SOME WAY
HOW DID HE IN ALL OF HIS THEORIES NOT MENTION THE CASTOR WHEEL EFFECT A BIG PART THAT KEEPS THE WHEEL POINTED FORWARDS IS THE SWEEP OF THE FORK PUSHING THE WHEEL AHEAD OF THE STEERING AXIS SO THAT ANY WEIGHT DOWNWARDS ON THE STEERER WILL CAUSE THE WHEEL TO STRAIGHTEN OUT A TOY THAT USES THIS IS THE WAVE BOARD OR TWO WHEELED SKATEBOARD APPARENTLY THAT IS WHY IT IS HARD IMPOSSIBLE TO RIDE A BIKE IN SPACE WITH MAGNETICALLY TETHERED WHEELS

IS THAT REALLY AN UNSOLVED PROBLEM
TED TALK FOR THE LAZY


WHAT ABOUT COUNTERSTEERING ON A MOTORCYCLE PERHAPS THE HEAVIER WEIGHT OF THE FRONT WHEEL BRINGS THE GYROSCOPIC EFFECT INTO GREATER EFFECT

IF YOU YANK ON THE LEFT HANDLEBAR AT ANY SPEED ABOVE ON A TYPICAL MOTORCYCLE AND THAT BAD BOY IS TILTING RIGHT EVERY TIME
I LOVE THIS PROBLEM AND CHALLENGE EVERY PHYSICS ENTHUSIAST WITH IT EVERYONE IS MISINFORMED ABOUT IT OR UNAWARE OF IT
THE PROSPECT OF A REAL JOB TERRIFIED ME FAR MORE THAN GETTING A PHD
THE IDEA THAT BLEW ME AWAY IS THAT THE SPEED OF LIGHT THE SAME IN ALL REFERENCE FRAMES AND THIS UNIVERSALITY IS SO IMPORTANT THAT OUR CONCEPTUALIZATIONS OF TIME AND SPACE HAVE TO WARP
I ALWAYS LOVE THIS STORY OF HOW I ENDED UP CHOOSING MY COLLEGE MAJOR SO HERE I GO MY FRESHMAN YEAR I CAME IN UNDECLARED AND UNSURE OF WHAT THE HELL I WAS GOING TO DO WITH MYSELF SO I CHOSE TO JUST GO WITH GENERAL ENGINEERING AS A START ON THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL I WENT TO ONE OF MY INTRO ENGINEERING I WAS OOOO FUCKING BORED TO DEATH AND I SWEAR EVERYONE AROUND ME SEEMED IDIOTIC SO I REALIZED THAT I WAS DEFINITELY NOT DOING ENGINEERING AS A MAJOR THEN THEN THAT WEEKEND I ENDED UP GOING TO MY FRIENDS DORM WHO WAS A MATH MAJOR AND WE ALL ENDED UP GETTING EXTREMELY WASTED OFF OF EVERCLEAR LIKE SERIOUSLY AROUND LIKE SHOTS OF THAT SHIT BUT ONCE DRUNK I BEGAN TALKING TO MY FRIEND ABOUT MATHEMATICS AND SOMEHOW THE UNIVERSE AT THIS EXTREMELY DRUNK MOMENT IN TIME I SOMEHOW HAD A REALIZATION THAT I NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND THE INNER WORKINGS OF THE UNIVERSE A VERY NICE FEELING BTW THEN LITERALLY AT AM THE NEXT MORNING NOT EVEN HANGOVER OR ANYTHING I GOT UP AND CHANGED MY MAJOR TO MATH AND PHYSICS AND COMPLETELY REDID MY SCHEDULE I HAVEN'T CHANGED SINCE MY LOVE FOR SCIENCE HAS ONLY GROWN SINCE THEN AND I FEEL QUITE HAPPY ABOUT THE PATH I AM HEADED ON IN LIFE
THE WINTER OF MY LAST YEAR IN UNDERGRAD I WAS TAKING A GR CLASSICAL MY PROFESSOR HAS BEEN HEAVILY INVOLVED WITH THE SEARCH FOR GRAVITATIONAL WAVES AT FIGO FOR A WHILE NOW AT THIS POINT SOME OF YOU MIGHT IMAGINE WHERE THIS STORY IS GOING

TWO DAYS BEFORE THE ANNOUNCEMENT OUR PROFESSOR TOLD US THAT HE WAS CANCELLING CLASS BECAUSE OF THE UPCOMING PRESS CONFERENCE AT THAT POINT DESCRIBED AS AN UPDATE ON THE SITUATION AT FIGO HE WENT ON TO MENTION THAT OUR PHYSICS DEPARTMENT WOULD BE STREAMING THE PRESS CONFERENCE AND THAT HE WAS GOING TO HOST A COLLOQUIUM LATER IN THE DAY ON THIS SO-CALLED UPDATE ENCOURAGING ALL OF US TO COME SINCE WE MIGHT GET SOMETHING OUT OF IT

OF COURSE THE PURPOSE OF THE CONFERENCE WAS TO ANNOUNCE THAT FIGO HAD DETECTED WHAT WERE BEYOND ANY REASONABLE DOUBT THOUGHT TO BE GRAVITATIONAL WAVES THE ENTIRE DEPARTMENT CHEERED LIKE CRAZY FROM THE PRESS CONFERENCE TO THE COLLOQUIUM AND THE CELEBRATORY TOAST YOU COULD TELL THAT EVERY PERSON THERE WAS JUST COMPLETELY EUPHORIC ABOUT THE WHOLE THING I HAD ALWAYS WANTED TO DO RESEARCH ANYWAY BUT THE EVENTS OF THAT DAY SERVED AS A HUGE INSPIRATION FOR ME TO PURSUE PHYSICS
VISITING AND STANDING ON TOP OF THE ABLATOR TOKAMAK AT MIT I'D BEEN VERY INTERESTED IN FUSION AND PLASMA PHYSICS FOR SOME TIME BEFORE THAT THIS WAS LAST YEAR I WAS IN GRADE BUT VISITING A FUSION REACTOR IN PERSON WAS JUST MIND BLOWING

TOKAMAKS LIKE ABLATOR NOW SHUT DOWN DUE TO FUNDING CUTS UNFORTUNATELY ARE THE RESULT OF VARIOUS FIELDS OF CUTTING EDGE PHYSICS TO CREATE SOMETHING TRULY REMARKABLE

I ALSO REMEMBER SEEING A HUGE POSTER IN A HALLWAY WITH A CROSS SECTION OF THE REACTOR AND EACH LITTLE BIT HAD SOMEONE'S NAME LINKED TO IT HUNDREDS OF PHYSICISTS AND ENGINEERS COLLABORATING TO MAKE THIS THING A REALITY BOGGLES THE MIND
I'VE SOMEHOW KNOWN SINCE PRIMARY SCHOOL GOT IT FIRST WHEN I WAS MAYBE COMBINE THAT WITH A BROTHER OLDER THAN ME WHO WAS DOING HIS UNDERGRAD AT THE TIME AND AN AWESOME TEACHER AND NOT A SINGLE QUESTION I HAD AND THERE WERE TONS WENT UNANSWERED BUT WHAT ANNOYED ME THE MOST WAS HOW I COULD SEE THEY WERE TRYING TO SIMPLIFY THINGS FOR ME BECAUSE AT THAT AGE I SIMPLY DIDN'T HAVE THE NECESSARY MATH KNOWLEDGE FOR EXAMPLE WE'D BE DOING A BODY SLIDING ON AN INCLINE AND I'D GET STUCK WITH THE GEOMETRY OF FORCES A TYPICAL CONVERSATION WOULD BE STH LIKE OH BUT JUST TAKE A SINE OF IT HUH WHAT
I LOST INTEREST IN HIGH SCHOOL AT LEAST FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS BECAUSE THE TEACHER WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE SHE WOULD WRITE DOWN NOTES DERIVATIONS FORMULAE ON THE BOARD GET US TO COPY IT AND THEN EXPLAIN AKA JUST READ THEM OUT LOUD THEN I MOVED SCHOOLS CHOSE PHYSICS AS PART OF MY IB DIPLOMA COURSE AND MY MIND WAS BLOWN AGAIN AN AMAZING TEACHER AGAIN TONS OF HANDS ON PRACTICE WORK EVERY WEEK BASICALLY A GLIMPSE INTO CALCULUS IN PHYSICS AND EVERYTHING SEEMED JUST TO BE WAITING FOR ME I STARTED MY UNDERGRAD AND NEVER LOOKED BACK EVEN WITH THE PARTS IT IS WAY TOO AWESOME TO BE LEFT ALONE
I DID ONE THE SUMMER MY FIRST YEAR MY ADVICE WOULD BE TO APPLY TO OVER A DOZEN INTERNSHIPS YOU MIGHT ONLY GET ONE OR TWO OFFERS AND THEY MIGHT NOT BE THE ONES YOU WANT MOST BUT IT'LL BE A GOOD PLACE TO START AND IF YOU DO WELL AT IT YOU'LL HAVE A GOOD REFERENCE AND PROBABLY GET AN EVEN BETTER ONE NEXT YEAR
YOU'RE BASICALLY ASKING WHY WE CAN'T SWALLOW OUR OWN THROATS

YOU ARE CONFUSING A BLACK STRUCTURE ITS SPACETIME CURVATURE FOR EVENTS IT CAN AFFECT LOCAL MATTER AND ENERGY

WHY DOES THAT SPACE BESIDE THE BLACK HOLE NOT BECOME PART OF THE BLACK HOLE LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE

THAT'S LIKE ASKING WHY A WHIRLPOOL IN A LAKE DOESN'T CONSUME THE WHOLE LAKE THE SIZE OF THE WHIRLPOOL IS DEPENDENT ON ITS STRENGTH SO THE REASON THE BLACK HOLE DOESN'T CONSUME LITERALLY EVERYTHING IS BECAUSE IT IS ONLY SO STRONG AS COMPARED WITH THE LOCAL SPACETIME TENSION AND EXPANSION I THINK
IT SAYS THAT BLACK HOLES ARE JUST COLLECTIONS OF THESE EVENTS THAT WE CAN NOT PERCEIVE

NUMBER THE BLACK HOLES ARE ACTUALLY THERE AND THE OBJECTS THAT FELL IN ARE IN IT THERE ARE COORDINATE SYSTEMS OF BLACK HOLES WHICH DON'T WORK RIGHT AT THE EVENT HORIZON SOME VARIABLES GO TO INFINITY THERE BUT THERE ARE ALSO COORDINATE SYSTEMS WITHOUT THOSE ISSUES COORDINATE SYSTEMS ARE ARBITRARY THE PHYSICS IS INDEPENDENT OF THEM THE PHYSICS DOESN'T HAVE THE ISSUES SOME COORDINATE SYSTEMS HAVE
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SCHWARZSHILD METRIC YOU WILL SEE THE TERM RS R IN THE DENOMINATOR SO THE SINGULARITY ARISES AND THEREFORE IS THE REQUIREMENT FOR THERE TO BE A BLACK HOLE WHEN RS EQUALS R WITH R THE COORDINATE DISTANCE TO THE OBJECT AND RS THE SCHWARSCHILD RADIUS C 2

AND WHY DOES SOMETHING STOP EXISTING WHEN SEPARATE FROM YOU FROM THE EVENT HORIZON YOU COULD SAY ANYTHING THAT YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO SEE DOESN'T EXIST
YOU GOTTA TO HAVE IN MIND THAT A BLACK HOLE IS A COLLAPSED STAR THUS THE INSIDE IS MADE OF THE FORMER CORE OF A STAR EVERY MASSIVE OBJECTS CREATE A GRAVITATIONAL FIELD AND SO A ESCAPE VELOCITY IS RELATED ON EARTH ITS ABOUT H THE ESCAPE VELOCITY OF A BLACK HOLE IS SO HUGE THAT EVEN THE LIGHT CANNOT ESCAPE FROM IT THIS IS WHY THERE IS A HORIZON WHERE LIGHT IS TRAPPED TOO FAST TO BE SWALLOWED BY THE BH BUT NOT ENOUGH TO ESPACE ITS GRAVITATIONAL FIELD SO THERE IS NO REASON THE BH SHOULD EXPAND OR ANY MATTER BEYOND ITS GRAVITATIONAL FIELD SHOULD BE ATTRACTED
AND YOU TALK ABOUT SPACE BESIDE THE BLACK HOLE NOT BECOME PART OF THE BLACK HOLE A BH IS A DEFORMATION OF SPACE TIME ITSELF HOW COULD THIS BECOME PART OF IT
HOPE I MADE MYSELF CLEAR
IT HAS A HIGHER RELATIVE MASS THAN ALL OF ITS ISOTOPES MASS NUMBERS BUT NOT THE ACTUAL MASSES OF ALL THE ISOTOPES SPECIFICALLY WHICH IS BY FAR THE DOMINANT ISOTOPE HAS AN ACTUAL MASS OF WHICH IS A BIT ABOVE THE RELATIVE MASSACHUSETTS

HAVING A MASS HIGHER THAN ITS MASS NUMBER MIGHT BE WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO AS THE MASS DEFECT I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT TERM
YES BY DEFINITION

FOR FUTURE REFERENCE R ASKPHYSICS IS A BETTER FORUM FOR SIMPLE QUESTIONS
I THINK YOU CAN ASK IN R GERMANY OR R DE TOO
STUDYING TO DO TEACHING IN SCHOOLS IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THING YOU DO SPECIAL COURSES ON THE MORE DIFFICULT MODERN STUFF THAT ISN'T TOO RELEVANT FOR SCHOOLS LIKE THEORETICAL PHYSICS FOR TEACHING CANDIDATES IF YOU WANTED TO GET BACK INTO RESEARCH FROM THAT IT WOULD BE A LONG WAY A FRIEND OF MINE FINISHED THAT AND FOUND TEACHING KIDS WASN'T FOR HIM SO HE TRIED DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT WITH MATH PHYSICS BUT HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO DO A LOT OF STUFF WHERE HE HAD OF LECTURES COMPARED TO STUDENTS OF PROPER PHYSICS OR MATHEMATICS

THEN FOR BACHELORS THERE'S USUALLY NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN THEORETICAL OR EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS YOU JUST CHOOSE A DIFFERENT SET OF COURSES IN 3RD YEAR SEMESTER BACHELOR THAT FITS YOUR INTERESTS BEST

MASTER PROGRAMS ARE EITHER THE SAME FOR THEORETICAL OR EXPERIMENTAL AND AGAIN YOU CHOOSE A DIFFERENT SET OF COURSES WITH A LOT MORE FREEDOM THAN IN A BACHELOR PROGRAM OR THERE'S SOMETHING LIKE TECHNISCHE PHYSIK TECHNICAL EMPHASIS WHICH MIGHT TRAIN YOU BETTER TOWARDS WORKING IN THE INDUSTRY A FRIEND OF MINE DID THAT AND HIS PROGRAM DIFFERED A BIT IN WHAT WAS CONSIDERED MANDATORY AND I THINK HE HAD TO DO DO AN INTERNSHIP AT SOME COMPANY

THAT SAID THERE MAY BE UNIVERSITIES THAT WILL HAVE A SPECIAL MASTER'S PROGRAM FOR THEORETICAL PHYSICS IN THE SAME WAY I DESCRIBED PHYSICS WITH TECHNICAL EMPHASIS ABOVE I DOUBT IT MAKES MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE THOUGH THEY'LL PROBABLY LOOK MORE FOR THE COURSES YOU HAVE TAKEN AND IF THEY GIVE YOU QUALIFICATION FOR A JOB RATHER THAN JUST CHECKING THE NAME OF THE PROGRAM WHETHER IT'S JUST PHYSICS OR TECHNICAL PHYSICS OR THEORETICAL PHYSICS OR WHATEVER YOU CAN MAKE UP


AGAIN TEACHING IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AND INCOMPATIBLE AND WILL BE PEDAGOGIC TRAINING AND VERY LIGHT ON MODERN PHYSICS AND MORE ABSTRACT MATH

A PROPER PHYSICS DEGREE WILL BE DOWNWARD COMPATIBLE BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO MAKE UP FOR THE MISSING PEDAGOGICAL TRAINING INCLUDING INTERNSHIPS AT SCHOOLS I THINK SEVERAL ONES STARTING OUT AS ONCE A WEEK IN THE FIRST SEMESTERS THEN A LONGER ONE OF MONTHS FINALLY A FULL SEMESTER OF SCHOOLS AND ACCOMPANYING SEMINARS AND AFTER ACQUIRING THE MASTER'S DEGREE A PROPER CANDIDATE TEACHING POSITION OF YEARS WHICH YOU HAVE TO PASS TO BECOME A TEACHER

BTW I'M IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS AND DID A PLAIN PHYSICS BSC FOLLOWED BY A PHYSICS MSC IN GERMANY
I CAN'T COMMENT ON MOST OF THIS BUT I DO FEEL LIKE YOU ARE WAY OFF THE MARK WHEN IT COMES TO ENGINEERING

FIRST OF COURSE HAVING A BS IN PHYSICS DOES NOT MAKE YOU QUALIFIED TO BE ANY KIND OF ENGINEER ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING COVERS SOME VERY SPECIFIC STUFF AND SOMEONE WITH A PHYSICS DEGREE WILL TYPICALLY KNOW ONLY THE INTRODUCTORY EE KNOWLEDGE MAYBE YOU COULD GET A JOB AS AN ENTRY LEVEL RF EE YOU ARE ON POINT ABOUT THAT

HOWEVER WHERE THE REAL ENGINEERING JOBS FOR PHYSICS PEOPLE LIE ARE IN SEMICONDUCTORS WORKING IN A WAFER FAB AS A PROCESS ENGINEER METROLOGY ENGINEER ETC INVOLVES A LOT OF PHYSICS AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF THESE JOBS OUT THERE

I'M AN APPLICATION ENGINEER KIND OF A CATCH ALL PHRASE FOR MAKING STUFF WORK AND DEALING WITH CUSTOMERS AND I WORK IN METROLOGY FOR MOST SEMICONDUCTOR AND PROBABLY OTHER INDUSTRIAL MEASUREMENT METHODS YOU USE PHYSICS AND PHYSICS THAT WILL BE FAMILIAR TO SOMEONE WITH A BS IN PHYSICS

AT MY COMPANY WE MAKE TOOLS THAT MEASURE USING OPTICS BY SHINING A LARGE RANGE OF LIGHT FROM UV TO IR AT AN OBJECT AND MEASURING THE REFLECTANCE I AM LITERALLY USING APPLIED PHYSICS EVERY DAY AS AN ENGINEER AND THIS WAS MY FIRST JOB AFTER GRADUATING WITH A BS IN PHYSICS

WHEN I GO ON BUSINESS TRIPS I TRAIN AND WORK WITH PROCESSING ENGINEERS METROLOGY ENGINEERS AND MAINTENANCE GUYS THINK FIXING MULTI MILLION DOLLAR TOOLS NOT TINKERING WITH AIR CONDITIONING THESE ARE ALL JOBS THAT A PHYSICS BS COULD GET INTO ON AN ENTRY LEVEL OR MS PHD COULD DO ON A HIGHER LEVEL

AND SURE ENOUGH I WORK WITH BS MS PHD PHYSICS PEOPLE EVERY SINGLE DAY

BASICALLY ANY WAFER OR DISK FAB WILL HAVE THE NEED FOR LOTS OF PHYSICS PEOPLE ON MULTIPLE LEVELS THERE ARE ABS LIKE THIS ALL OVER THE WORLD I EVEN SPENT TWO WEEKS AT A WAFER FAB IN SICILY WORKING WITH PHYSICISTS CHEMISTS AND MATERIAL SCIENCE GUYS AND GALS

MOST WAFER DISK ABS HAVE MOVED OUT OF THE US BUT THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF THEM AROUND I'VE PERSONALLY WORKED WITH ABS IN SAN JOSE SAN ANTONIO AND MOUNTAINTOP PENNSYLVANIA AND I KNOW OF ABS IN PORTLAND OR LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO IDAHO AND UTAH
GREAT POST

JUST TO BUILD ON WHAT YOU'VE SAID HERE ARE SOME LESS TRADITIONAL CAREERS THAT PHYSICS CAN LEAD TO FROM SOME PERSONAL DIRECT AND INDIRECT EXPERIENCE

LAW AS YOU SAID SPECIFICALLY IP AND PATENTS
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
LEADING ON FROM THAT TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT SOMETHING THAT I USED TO WORK IN
HEALTH PHYSICS EAST G RADIATION PROTECTION WHAT I CURRENTLY WORK IN
PROJECT MANAGEMENT
CONSULTING EAST G ON MANAGEMENT OR JOB SKILLS
FINANCE
MARKET ANALYSIS WHETHER FINANCE OR OTHER SECTOR
INTELLIGENCE WHETHER DEFENCE OR BUSINESS
MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS ESPECIALLY FOR TECH SCIENCE COMPANIES
OPERATIONS EAST G MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY WITHIN A BUSINESS

PHYSICS HAS A LOT OF TRANSFERABLE SKILLS THAT SOME PEOPLE OFTEN DON'T LINK TOGETHER ASIDE FROM THE OBVIOUS ONES LIKE PROBLEM SOLVING

TIME PROJECT MANAGEMENT REMEMBER ALL THAT LAB WORK THAT YOU DO AND EXPERIMENTS THAT YOU DESIGN EMPLOYERS DIG THAT STUFF
COMMUNICATION WRITTEN AND VERBAL FROM PRESENTATIONS AND REPORTS AND IF YOU'VE HAD ONE VIVAS MAKE GREAT EXAMPLES BEING ABLE TO DEFEND A PIECE OF WORK THAT YOU'VE COMMITTED UP TO MULTIPLE YEARS OF YOUR LIFE TO IN A HIGH PRESSURE SITUATION IS VERY APPEALING TO EMPLOYERS
PERSONAL SKILLS TYING INTO THE ABOVE DESPITE THE AWKWARD SCIENTIST CLICH
TEAMWORK
BROAD RANGE OF IT SKILLS
ABILITY TO RESEARCH THIS SOUNDS BIZARRE BUT YOU'LL BE SURPRISED IN THE WORKING WORLD HOW POOR SOME PEOPLE ARE AT GENERAL RESEARCH EAST G FINDING INFORMATION ON COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS

TAKE THE ABOVE POINTS WITH OBVIOUS ONES LIKE PROBLEM SOLVING AND YOU'VE GOT A GENERAL JOB DESCRIPTION FOR PRETTY MUCH ANY JOB OUT THERE

IN SHORT TO ECHO U PHYSBRO DON'T THINK THAT PHYSICS PIGEON HOLES YOU INTO ACADEMIA OR TRADITIONAL JOBS
I JUST GRADUATED WITH A BA SCHOOL DOESN'T OFFER BS DOUBLE MAJOR IN PHYSICS AND MATH LAST MAY I APPLIED TO DOZENS OF RESEARCH JOBS AND DEFENSE CONTRACTORS OVER THE SUMMER AND HEARD NOTHING BACK DESPITE HAVING A GOOD GA SOME CONNECTIONS AND RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

THIS POST SOMEWHAT CONFIRMED MY EXPERIENCE THE JOB MARKET FOR ME SUCKED AND WAS NOTHING LIKE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE I'M CURRENTLY WORKING IN EDUCATION AND WEIGHING THE OPTIONS BETWEEN GETTING MY TEACHING LICENSE AND GOING BACK TO GRAD SCHOOL NOT GONNA LIE THIS POST KINDA MADE ME DOUBTFUL THAT I'D BE ABLE TO GET ANYWHERE
WHAT'S THE RESEARCH JOB MARKET LIKE IN ASTROPHYSICS
JUST WANT TO SAY THAT A GRADUATE DEGREE IN BIOLOGY IS NOT AS EMPLOYABLE AS YOU SEEM TO SUGGEST IN TERMS OF CASH FLOW YES A LOT MORE GRANT MONEY IS GIVEN OUT BUT THERE ARE ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY MORE BIOLOGY GRADUATE DEGREES THAN PHYSICS

IF YOU LOOK ON R BIOLOGY R BIOCHEMISTRY YOU MIGHT FIND VERY SIMILAR SITUATIONS TO WHAT PEOPLE HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH HERE
THIS POST REALLY HITS HOME FOR ME

I GRADUATED IN WITH A BACHELOR'S IN PHYSICS AND I THOUGHT I WAS SET I WAS TOLD BY PARENTS ADVISERS AND FRIENDS THAT JOBS WOULD BE THROWN AT ME LEFT AND RIGHT AND THAT I COULD REALLY GO INTO ANY FIELD THAT I FELT LIKE I WAS CONFIDENT THAT I'D BE ABLE TO GET A REASONABLE PAYING CAREER IN WHATEVER SUITED MY FANCY

WELL SIX YEARS LATER AND I'VE FOUND THAT TO NOT BE ENTIRELY TRUE THE ONLY JOBS I'VE BEEN ABLE TO LAND ARE IN EDUCATION AND ALL OF THEM PAY CRAP

I'M CURRENTLY UNEMPLOYED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS NOW AND I HAVE YET TO FIND A JOB POSTING THAT MENTIONS A BACHELORS IN PHYSICS WITHOUT REQUIRING YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN INSERT INCREDIBLY SPECIFIC BRANCH OF PHYSICS ENGINEERING HERE OR SAYING THAT AT LEAST A MASTER'S IS PREFERRED

I DEFINITELY FEEL LIED TO ABOUT THE USEFULNESS OF AN UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE IN PHYSICS IT'S NOW YEARS PAST COLLEGE AND I'VE JUST NOW REALIZED THAT IF I WANT TO DO THE THINGS THAT I ENJOYED DOING IN UNDERGRAD PHYSICS EVER AGAIN I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GET A MASTER'S DEGREE AT LEAST SIGH
THANKS FOR THIS SINCE I AM IN GERMANY I WOULD LIKE TO ASK AS FAR AS YOU KNOW IF THIS SITUATION IS THE SAME IN EUROPE AND MY CURRENT PLANE IS TO DO RESEARCH AFTER MY UNIVERSITY HOW HARD IS IT TO GET SUCH A JOB
WHEN DID PHYSICS BECOME THE FOUNDATION OF COMPUTER SCIENCE PRETTY SURE THE MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS ARE IN LOGIC AND DISCRETE MATHEMATICS I'M NOT SAYING THAT PHYSICISTS CAN'T TRANSFER THEIR KNOWLEDGE TO CS BUT TO SAY THAT PHYSICS IS A BASIS OR FOUNDATION FOR CS IS WRONG
THANKS FOR THIS ON MY FIRST YEAR BSC PHYSICS WITH ASTROPHYSICS THOROUGHLY CONSIDERING CHANGING THAT TO W NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY SO THIS HELPED
ONE OF MY FRIENDS IN COLLEGE WAS A NUCLEAR ENGINEERING PHD THAT WAS HIRED DIRECTLY INTO FINANCE AS I UNDERSTAND IT THE TOOLS FOR FINDING A TINY PARTICLE THAT EXISTED MOMENTARILY AMONG A SEA OF DATA ALSO HELPS YOU FIND LUCRATIVE INVESTMENTS BEFORE EVERYONE ELSE ONCE OTHERS FIND IT IT IS NOT AS LUCRATIVE
LET ME SHARE MY STORY THEN
PHYSICS ACTUALLY BUILDS A MENTAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO BE EXPERT IN PROBLEM SOLVING COMPUTERS PROVIDE THE TOOLS FOR IT I AM A HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS GRADUATE MSC FROM A STATE US UNIVERSITY AND 2 DEGREES IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND PHYSICS YEARS EACH I DID A PHD FOR A YEAR AND I HAD TO LEAVE IT IN ORDER TO FIND A JOB YEARS OLD BACK THEN

I LANDED A JOB IN ALGORITHMIC TRADING AS QUANTITATIVE ANALYST FOR 2 YEARS THEN I MOVED INTO DATA SCIENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING AND I DO THIS FOR THE LAST 2 YEARS

BUILDING MODELS THAT EMULATE ASPECTS OF THE REAL WORLD MAKING PREDICTIONS AND FACILITATE DECISION MAKING CAN BE THE CLOSEST EQUIVALENT TO PHYSICS MENTALITY YOU CAN FIND IN THE BUSINESS WORLD

JUST KEEP IN MIND THAT YOU STILL NEED TO KEEP UP WITH RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

OUR SPECIES DIDN'T TAKE CARE OF FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS LESS THAN PEOPLE IN A PLANET OF BILLION CAN DO PURE THEORETICAL PHYSICS YOU ARE NOT ONE OF THEM IT IS UNFORTUNATE BUT LIFE GOES ON
AS A FRESHMAN UNDERGRADUATE WHO LOVES ASTRONOMY ASTROPHYSICS WHAT SHOULD MY PLAN BE TO OBTAIN A CAREER IN THE FIELD

THIS IS PROBABLY NAIVE BUT IT IS DEPRESSING TO ME THAT I COULD GET A PHYSICS COMPESCE DEGREE AND END UP GOING INTO GOVERNMENT FINANCE EVEN ENGINEERING

I REALLY WANT TO STAY IN ASTRO BUT I AM RECEIVING MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT AVAILABILITY OF JOBS SHOULD I EVEN WORRY ABOUT THIS NOW
THIS IS A GREAT POST YOU MENTIONED GEOPHYSICS AS A FIELD IN WHICH YOU'RE BETTER WITH GEOSCIENCE OR GEOPHYSICS AS UNDERGRADUATE A SIMILAR FIELD TO THIS WHICH IS MUCH MORE SUITED TO A PURE PHYSICS EDUCATION RATHER THAN GEOLOGY WOULD BE PETROPHYSICS

A PETROPHYSICISTS ROLE REVOLVES AROUND EITHER ACQUIRING OR INTERPRETING DATA FROM DOWN OIL GAS WELLS ACQUIRED USING PETROPHYSICAL LOGGING TOOLS THAT ARE EITHER LOWERED DOWN THE WELL ON WIFELINESS OR ATTACHED TO A DRILLING ASSEMBLY AND MEASURED WHILE DRILLING THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES MEASURED CAN THEN BE USED TO DETERMINE PROPERTIES SUCH AS POROSITY PERMEABILITY WATER SATURATION HENCE HYDROCARBON SATURATION LITHOLOGY ETC

PETROPHYSICAL TOOLS CAN MEASURE A WIDE RANGE OF PROPERTIES EAST G GAMMA RAY COUNTS AT DIFFERENT ENERGY LEVELS CAN HELP DETERMINE CLAY VOLUMES AND PROPERTIES BULK DENSITY THE MASS DENSITY CAN BE INFERRED FROM ELECTRON DENSITY MEASURED FROM COMPTON SCATTERING IN THE FORMATION NEUTRON POROSITY MEASURING HOW MUCH HYDROGEN HENCE FLUIDS ARE IN THE FORMATION USING A NEUTRON SOURCE AND A COUPLE OF DETECTORS PHOTO-ELECTRIC FACTOR VERY GOOD FOR LITHOLOGY DETERMINATION RESISTIVITY READINGS AT VARIOUS DEPTHS OF INVESTIGATION FROM THE BOREHOLE FOR USE IN OUR WATER HYDROCARBON SATURATION EQUATIONS COMPRESSIONAL AND SHEAR SONIC READINGS GOOD FOR POROSITY CALCULATIONS BUT ALSO TO HELP TIE IN THE PETROPHYSICS TO THE GEOPHYSICS NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE LOOKS AT THE HYDROGEN FLUIDS IN THE FORMATION FROM THE NMR RELAXATION TIME WE CAN DETERMINE VOLUMES OF CLAY-BOUND IRREDUCIBLE AND FREE FLUID AS WELL AS CALCULATE PERMEABILITY ELEMENTAL CAPTURE SPECTROSCOPY INDUCING GAMMA RAYS FROM VARIOUS ELEMENTS IN THE FORMATION USING HIGH ENERGY NEUTRONS AND DETERMINING LITHOLOGY FROM THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCES OF THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS
I HAVE A BACHELOR'S IN ENGINEERING PHYSICS AND AM NOW A GRADUATE STUDENT STUDYING BIOPHYSICS AND I HAVE ACTUALLY SEEN A LOT OF MY CLASSMATES GO INTO DATA MINING AND DATA SCIENCE JOBS EMPLOYERS SEEM TO LIKE THE SKILL SET OF PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH DATA ANALYSIS BUT OP IS RIGHT PHYSICS IS A GREAT BASE BUT YOU CAN'T EXPECT AN EMPLOYER TO BE AMAZED AT YOUR PHYSICS DEGREE YOU NEED TO AUGMENT IT WITH SOME MORE SPECIFIC CLASSES WHETHER IT BE IN ELECTRONICS OR COMPUTER SCIENCE
EUROPEAN PHYSICIST HERE OPTICS IS A FIELD ALMOST UNTOUCHED BY OTHER DEGREE COURSES AND WITH SOME DEMAND IN INDUSTRY THERE ARE ALSO OPPORTUNITIES TO PURSUE IT ON AN ACADEMIC LEVEL WITH MOST UNIVERSITIES I HAVE COLLEAGUES AT RECEIVING FUNDING FROM INDUSTRY WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO FUND PROJECTS HOWEVER AS WITH MOST SCIENCE DEGREES LET'S BE HONEST YOU NEED A MASTERS OR MORE
THIS IS A BIT SILLY I TOOK PHYSICS AS MY MAJOR IN UNDERGRAD BUT I ENDED UP SWITCHING OUT OF IT IN FAVOR OF COMP SCIENCE THE ONLY REASON I DID THE SWITCH WAS TO GUARANTEE MYSELF A JOB AFTER GRADUATION WHICH I DID

IN NO WAY SHAPE OR FORM DID MY PHYSICS BACKGROUND LEAD TO A JOB

SO FOR YOU TO SAY THAT PHYSICS IS EMPLOYABLE BECAUSE IF YOU ALSO DO COMP SCI OR BIOLOGY OR ENGINEERING YOU CAN GET A JOB IS MISLEADING
I'M CURRENTLY DOING MY BACHELOR AND PLAN ON DOING THE MASTER RIGHT AFTER BUT MY GRADES ARE NOT SPECTACULAR PROBABLY AVERAGE OR BELOW AVERAGE

DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY INSIGHT ON HOW MY CHANCES ARE GETTING A JOB IN ACADEMIA I IMAGINE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO GO INTO ACADEMIA ARE THE GUYS WHO HAVE THE RATHER GOOD GRADES AND A LOT OF PASSION SO I IMAGINE THAT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO COMPETE WITH THEM

I SHOULD ADD THAT I'M CURRENTLY UNSURE ABOUT MY FUTURE CAREER AND WANT TO GET MORE INFO AND KNOWING THAT I CAN CANCEL ONE OPTION ISN'T TOO BAD BECAUSE THEN I CAN FOCUS ON WHAT I CAREER PATH I CAN SHOULD TAKE INSTEAD
I HAVE A DEGREE IN PHYSICS YEARS EXPERIENCE AND UNEMPLOYED FOR 2 YEARS NOW
OP HAS A THREAD TITLED THOUGHTS ON MEDICAL PHYSICS NOW NAMED MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL PHYSICS DAYS AGO

TAKE HIS ADVICE WITH A GRAIN OF SALT BE SKEPTICAL OF WHAT YOU READ ONLINE

FACT IS THERE ARE NOT MANY JOBS THAT SPECIFICALLY ASK FOR A PHYSICS DEGREE DON'T BE DELUSIONAL STUDY WELL ABOVE AVERAGE GRADES FROM A DECENT UNIVERSITY MAY HELP GETTING A JOB IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE RELEVANT EXPERIENCE GET A MINOR IN ENGINEERING IF YOU CAN HANDLE IT AND REALLY WANT TO PLAY IT SAFE EE OR CS HAS THE MOST DEMAND IT'S NOT PRETTY PEOPLE FROM MY BATCH MOSTLY BECOME TEACHERS OR DO A MASTER IN ENGINEERING
CURRENTLY A MATH MAJOR DOING A MINOR IN CS IS IT STILL POSSIBLE FOR ME TO GET INTO MEDICAL PHYSICS I'VE ALWAYS LOVED PHYSICS BUT I DECIDED TO PURSUE MATH BECAUSE IT CAN BE APPLIED TO A TON OF AREAS OF STUDY
WELL I'M CURRENTLY IN MY FIRST SEMESTER OF STUDYING PHYSICS AT THE TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF MUNICH AND AT THE LAST TWO SEMESTERS YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE ONE OF THE FOLLOWING FOUR SUBJECTS TO RECESS INTO

BIOPHYSICS
APPLIED AND ENGINEERING PHYSICS
CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS
NUCLEAR PARTICLE AND ASTROPHYSICS

NOW I ACTUALLY DECIDED ON STUDYING PHYSICS BECAUSE OF MY PASSION FOR IT I LOVE TO UNDERSTAND HOW EVERYTHING AROUND ME WORKS HOW THE UNIVERSE WORKS
BUT I DON'T WANT TO WORK IN ANY RESEARCH RELATED FIELDS TSH
I WAS THINKING ABOUT APPLIED AND ENGINEERING PHYSICS SO THAT I COULD WORK IN ENGINEERING FIELDS WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF A PHYSICIST
BUT YOUR POST KINDA DISCOURAGED ME NOW ESPECIALLY THAT YOU SEEM TO BE TALKING FROM EXPERIENCE
THE TUM ADAI HAPPENS TO BE NUMBER IN EMPLOYABILITY WORLDWIDE DOES THAT HELP
YOU MISSED OUT ON A HUGE LUCRATIVE BRIDGE BETWEEN PHYSICS AND LAW PATENT LAW

TO BE A PATENT ATTORNEY YOU MUST HAVE A TECHNICAL BACKGROUND THERE'S NOT A TON OF PEOPLE WITH THE BACKGROUNDS THAT PEOPLE WANT EE COMPANY SCIENCE PHYSICS TO A LESSER DEGREE WHO GO ON TO LAW SCHOOL

IT'S A GREAT OPTION
MINOR QUIBBLE FROM AN ENGINEER BY DEGREE AND TITLE HERE IN THE US MOST OF US AREN'T LICENSED AND NEVER WILL BE THE ONLY ENGINEERS REQUIRED TO BE LICENSED ARE THE ONES WORKING ON CONSTRUCTION RELATED PROJECTS POWER DISTRIBUTION O G I THINK ETC A PE WON'T BE REQUIRED TO WORK AT COMPANIES LIKE TESLA APPLE MICROSOFT FORD RAYTHEON INTEL NATIONAL INSTRUMENTS AND ON DOWN THE LINE

THAT SAID THERE IS A DEFINITE KNOWLEDGE GAP BETWEEN A PHYSICS UNDERGRAD AND ANY SPECIALIZED ENGINEERING UNDERGRAD MY GUESS IS THE BREADTH OF KNOWLEDGE FROM A PHYSICS BS WOULD PROBABLY PUT YOU SOMEWHERE BETWEEN A SOPHOMORE AND JUNIOR LEVEL MAYBE OF THE IMPORTANT STUFF OBVIOUSLY THAT'S GOING TO VARY AMONG PROGRAMS AND SPECIALIZATIONS MECH AERO AND ELECTRICAL ALL MAKE SENSE AS POSSIBLE PATHS AND ARE INCREDIBLY BROAD FIELDS DEPENDING ON THE FOCUS OF THE PHYSICS UNDERGRAD AND WHAT YOU DO TO FILL THE KNOWLEDGE GAP

POINT BEING WHILE A PHYSICS BS LIKELY WON'T GET YOU AN ENGINEERING JOB AT A BIG COMPANY IT COULD GET YOU AN ENGINEERING JOB AT A SMALL COMPANY IF YOU'VE PURSUED SOME ENGINEERING ELECTIVES OR EXTRACURRICULAR TO FILL THE GAP AND YOU SHOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM GETTING ON WITH AN ENGINEERING MASTER'S IF THAT'S THE ROUTE YOU DECIDE YOU WANT TO GO IT'S ALMOST DEFINITELY GOING TO TAKE MORE WORK THAN JUST WALKING OUT WITH A PHYSICS BS AND WALKING INTO A JOB BUT ENGINEERING IS DEFINITELY A VIABLE PATH WITH A LITTLE MORE WORK THOUGH LIKE YOU SAID IF SOMEONE WANTS TO DO ENGINEERING THEY SHOULD SIMPLY START WITH ENGINEERING IF POSSIBLE
HI I HOPE THAT YOU WILL SEE THIS I AM CURRENTLY STUDYING ENGINEERING PHYSICS THE DEGREE IS ABET ACCREDITED AND I WANT TO SPECIALIZE IN APPLIED OPTICS AND THEN MAYBE GET A MASTERS IN APPLIED PHYSICS WOULD THIS BE GOOD FOR A HIGH PAYING JOB IN INDUSTRY LIKE LOCKHEED OR NASA OR THE LIKE ARE APPLIED PHYSICS MAJORS TYPICALLY CONSIDERED GOOD OR WOULD IT BE BETTER TO GET A MASTERS IN SAY ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING OR COMPUTER SCIENCE
I DON'T REALLY KNOW ABOUT THE US BUT I CAN TELL YOU MY IMPRESSION I GOT HERE IN EUROPE

IF YOU STUDY PHYSICS TO LATER DO PHYSICS IT'S LIKE OP SAID YOU GONNA HAVE A BAD TIME RESEARCH POSITIONS ARE VERY RARE AND YOU'RE BASICALLY UNABLE TO GET ONE WITHOUT HAVING CONNECTIONS AND BEFRIENDING YOUR PROFS

HOWEVER PHYSICISTS ARE REALLY POPULAR IN FINANCE AND MANAGEMENT CONSULTING AS I SAID IN THIS COMMENT THIS SEEMS TO BE DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE ARE EXPOSED TO HARD TO SOLVE PROBLEMS ALMOST ALL THE TIME STUDYING PHYSICS BUILDS A HIGH FRUSTRATION TOLERANCE AND GOT PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS ALSO WE'RE GOOD WITH NUMBERS AND NUMBERS FORTUNATELY DON'T CARE IF THEY REPRESENT THE SPEED OF LIGHT OR MONEY

FURTHERMORE A BS IN PHYSICS IS PRETTY WORTHLESS YOU MIGHT ASWELL DO LIBERAL ARTS SLIGHT EXAGGERATION IF YOU WANT TO GET A JOB GET A MASTERS DEGREE OR EVEN BETTER A PHD WITH ONE OF THESE YOU'RE ALMOST GUARANTEED A WELL PAYING POSITION
CAN'T CTRL F ON MY PHONE BUT DATA SCIENCE JOBS TAKE PHYSICISTS AS MUCH AS THEY CAN GET THEM BUNCH OF PHYSICISTS AT OUR METUMPS THOSE JOBS PAY WELL TOO

THE CODING ISN'T THAT HARD AND YOU LEARN IT FROM COLLEAGUES AND ONLINE COURSES BUT THE SHEER FACT THAT YOU'D UNDERSTAND BASIC STATS AND MATH AND ARE A PROBLEM SOLVER MAKE YOU WANTED IN THIS SECTOR AT LEAST FROM WHAT I SEE
I AM DOUBLE MAJORING WITH MY FIRST IN COMPUTER ENGINEERING AND SECOND IN PHYSICS AND I'M SUPER EXCITED TO SEE WHERE IT TAKES ME
WHAT SHOULD I MAJOR IN IF I WANT TO BE THE NEXT BILLY NYE KAPPA
YOU WANT TO TEACH PHYSICS IN HIGHSCHOOL WELL THERE YOU GO MAKE SURE YOU LOAD UP ON BIRD COURSES AND GET YOUR AVERAGE RIGHT TO GET INTO TEACHERS COLLEGE

WHAT ARE BIRD COURSES
THANK YOU FOR THE WELL WRITTEN POST I'VE BEEN AGREEING WITH A LOT OF YOUR COMMENTS AS AN UNDERGRAD AT THE MOMENT PHYSICS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN GO INTO ANY FIELD BY ITSELF

DO YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME TO GO INTO COMPUTER SCIENCE I'M FROM THE UK SO IT'S ONLY POSSIBLE TO STUDY ONE SUBJECT PHYSICS UNFORTUNATELY HAHA AND THE IDEA OF GOING THROUGH ANOTHER YEARS SOUNDS NOT SO IDEAL ULTIMATELY I'M LOOKING TO MAYBE ONE DAY JOIN GAME DEVELOPMENT AS THE FIELD TO GO IN

AND WHAT ABOUT I SWEAR ALL THE NEWS I READ ABOUT MUSK NASA AND EVEN BOEING NOW TELLS ME THAT YOUR AVERAGE UNDERGRAD IS GOING TO BE A BIT MORE IN DEMAND WITHIN THE NEXT SAY YEARS

I'M JUST PRAYING THAT'S THE CASE BECAUSE I'M IN MY FINAL YEAR
SO I HAVE TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE AS A DIESEL MECHANIC I AM PURSUING MY UNDERGRAD IN PHYSICS AND IM NOT RULING OUT MASTERS PHD
WHILE I'M NOT YET PLANNING ON IT I AM DOING THINGS THAT WOULD HELP SHOULD I CHOOSE TO THOUGH SO COMBINE UNDERGRAD IN PHYSICS MECHANIC EXPERIENCE AND LOVE OF ANYTHING SPACE ASTRONOMY WHAT MIGHT THAT LOOK LIKE
IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING USING THIS THREAD AS ADVICE THAT IS OK BUT I FIRMLY BELIEVE THE MOST INFORMED DECISIONS CAN BE MADE THROUGH EXTENSIVE DISCUSSION WITH TEACHERS AND ADVISORS AT YOUR UNIVERSITY GET INVOLVED WITH RESEARCH AND MAKE FRIENDS WITH PROFESSORS YOU LIKE WHO ARE CLEARLY KNOWLEDGEABLE AND INVOLVED IN FIELDS YOU ARE INTERESTED IN AND TALK WITH THEM ABOUT YOUR FUTURE IN ADDITION THESE PEOPLE WILL BE MOST LIKELY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH OPPORTUNITIES THAT NO ONE ELSE KNOWS ABOUT MOST OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS STARTED FOR ME WITH AN EMAIL SO REACH OUT IT'S MUCH HARDER TO DO ON YOUR OWN
CHRIST THAT ENGINEERING JOB AVAILABILITY HURT ME BEFORE I TRANSFERED TO MY NEW UNIVERSITY MY PREVIOUS ADVISOR ACTUALLY TOLD ME THAT PHYSICS CAN ALLOW YOU TO TAKE ON FRETTY MICH ANY ENGINEERING JOB SO THATS WHY I ACTUALLY JOINED PHYSICS IF THATS NOT THE CASE MAYBE I NEED TO LOOK AT GETTING INTO A DIFFERENT FIELD
THOUGHTS ON HAVING HAVING BOTH A BS IN NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND IN PHYSICS THE TWO SEEM LIKE A FANTASTIC COMBO TO ME IT'S MY CURRENT PATH ACADEMICALLY
I THINK I CAN CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING HERE AS I WORK IN FINANCE AND THE OP SAID HE DOESN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT

BASICALLY ALMOST EVERYBODY ON MY TEAM HAS A PHYSICS BACKGROUND I ALSO KNOW QUITE A FEW PEOPLE WHO DID PHYSICS AND NOW WORK IN SIMILAR JOBS AROUND THE WORLD THE CATCH IS NO ONE IS HIRING BACHELORS THEY SIMPLY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE AND MATHEMATICAL KNOWLEDGE TO DO THE JOB A MASTER'S IS A MINIMUM PHD PREFERRED MOSTLY IN THEORETICAL STUFF WITH A GOOD COMPUTATIONAL BACKGROUND TO GO TOGETHER THERE AREN'T MANY EXPERIMENTALISTS AROUND FORTUNATELY THE WORK ALSO FEELS LIKE THE CLOSEST YOU CAN GET TO THEORETICAL PHYSICS OUTSIDE ACADEMIA SO THAT'S PRETTY SATISFYING TOO

AS FOR THE PEOPLE IN THIS THREAD COMPLAINING ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE SAYING A BS IN PHYSICS IS JUST A START THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS IF YOUR PLAN IS TO STUDY FOR YEARS AND GET A JOB FORGET IT A PHYSICS BS WILL ONLY GIVE YOU CRAP DEAD END JOBS UNEMPLOYMENT OR A STRUGGLE IN OTHER FIELDS AGAINST PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY STUDIED THOSE SUBJECTS IF YEARS IS YOUR LIMIT THEN JUST DO COMPESCE OR WHATEVER AND YOU'LL BE ALL THE BETTER BUT IF YOU'RE AIMING FOR THE UPPER END OF THE PASCALE IN AREAS LIKE FINANCE OR MACHINE LEARNING A PHYSICS BS IS ONE OF THE MOST SOLID STARTS YOU CAN GET PROVIDED YOU FOLLOW UP WITH MORE PHYSICS AND BEFORE YOU ASK NO DOING STRAIGHT FINANCE IS NOT BETTER WE HARDLY EVER HIRE ANYONE LIKE THAT
LET'S SAY MY LONG TERM GOAL WAS TO DO WORK AT THE ITER REACTOR IN A HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR NOW AND WAS PLANNING ON TAKING SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF ENGINEERING PHYSICS PLASMA PHYSICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE WHAT DO YOU THINK I SHOULD TAKE IN ORDER TO MAYBE TAKE PART IN TRUE FUTURE OF NUCLEAR FUSION COMPUTER SCIENCE IS MY BACKUP I SUPPOSE
I'M GOING INTO ENGINEERING FROM A PHYSICS BACKGROUND I'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET SOME TOP NOTCH ENGINEERING INTERNSHIPS WHICH HAVE PROVIDED ME WITH THE EXPERIENCE I NEED TO WEASEL MY WAY INTO POTENTIAL ENGINEERING JOBS I MET A RECRUITER FROM BLUE ORIGIN AND SHE FAWNED OVER MY RESUME THOUGH I DON'T FEEL PARTICULARLY CONFIDENT THAT I AM QUALIFIED BUT I DEFINITELY FEEL THAT I HAVE A LOT MORE GROWTH POTENTIAL AND FLEXIBILITY THAN A LOT OF FORMER COLLEAGUES WHO WERE IN ME BUT WE HAVE VASTLY DIFFERENT SKILLETS

AGAIN I DO NOT REALLY FEEL QUALIFIED TO BE AN ENGINEER FOR MANY TASKS I WOULD NEED A LOT OF TRAINING WHICH IS WHY I AM GOING TO GRADUATE SCHOOL ALSO I WANT MUCH DEEPER KNOWLEDGE BUT IF I DECIDED I WAS GOING TO TRY FOR A JOB RIGHT OUT OF COLLEGE I WOULD PROBABLY HAVE MADE MORE OF AN EFFORT TO GET EXPERIENCE AND I THINK I WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE

I WANT TO SPEND MY LIFE WORKING IN ROBOTICS OR DEVELOPING SPACE INSTRUMENTS AND WHILE I WISH I HAD MORE PROJECT EXPERIENCE IN ELECTRONICS FABRICATION OR PHYSICS RESEARCH IN GENERAL I LOVE PHYSICS AND I COULD NOT BE MUCH HAPPIER WITH MY MAJOR CHOICE
THERE ARE A LOT OF JOBS FOR GOOD CANDIDATES WITH PHYSICS DEGREES BUT A PHYSICS DEGREE ALONE DOESN'T MAKE YOU A GOOD CANDIDATE
ONE THING I'VE SEEN FROM MY OWN CLASSMATES SEE IN THIS SUB AND OTHERS LIKE R PHYSICSSTUDENTS IS A LOT OF COMPLAINING AND PEOPLE SWITCHING MAJORS DO MORE THAN WHAT'S REQUIRED IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO MORE THEN YOU DON'T WANT A CAREER BAD ENOUGH

YOU'RE GOING TO APPLY TO A TON OF A JOBS THAT ARE GOING TO IGNORE YOU REJECT YOU IN THREE MONTHS OR EMAIL YOU A NO THAT SAME DAY ACCEPT IT MOVE ON APPLY SOMEWHERE ELSE
I'M SCEPTICAL ABOUT THIS IN THE UK UNIVERSITIES REGULARLY GET TO SHOW OFF EMPLOYMENT WITHIN INDUSTRY MONTHS AFTER GRADUATION YET YOU SEEM TO MAKE OUT THAT CAREERS WITHIN PHYSICS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN
SOMEONE REMIND ME TO ADD THIS TO THE SIDEBAR
IF IT'S RF YOU CAN FIND OUT ITS FREQUENCY AND EXPOSE IT TO POWERFUL RF AT THAT FREQUENCY IN THE HOPE OF DESTROYING IT
ONE OF MY PROFESSORS DOESN'T LIKE HIS KWIC CHIP TO WORK SO HE STICKS IT IN THE MICROWAVE FOR A COUPLE SECONDS WHEN HE GETS A NEW CARD PAINFUL FOR SUB DERMAL BUT YOU COULD STICK IT IN FRONT OF A RADAR ANTENNA OR RIG A MICROWAVE MAGNETRON TO WORK WITH THE DOOR OPEN
I'M NO EXPERT IN THIS FIELD BUT FROM MY UNDERSTANDING THERE'S A FEW THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND ABOUT THIS HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION YOU'VE BROUGHT UP
MICROCHIPS REQUIRE A POWER SUPPLY TO OPERATE SO THAT'S GOING TO TAKE UP SPACE IN YOUR BODY TOO AND WOULD PROBABLY BE VERY IDENTIFIABLE NOT TO MENTION OUR TECHNOLOGY IS NOT ADVANCED ENOUGH TO COMPLETELY INTEGRATE CIRCUITS INTO THE BODY WITHOUT THE BODY TRYING TO REJECT THEM HOWEVER I THINK THEY ARE WORKING WITH SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIALS WITH CERTAIN SUBSTRATES THAT WILL ONE DAY DO THIS
2 MAGNETS CAN AFFECT CIRCUITS VIA FARADAYS LAW CHANGING MAGNETIC FIELD CAUSES A CURRENT THROUGH A WIRE SO THAT'S WHY MAGNETS CLOSE TO YOU'RE ELECTRONIC DEVICES CAN CAUSE ISSUES SO POTENTIALLY IF YOU HAD AN IMPLANTED MICROCHIP YOU COULD CAUSE DISARRAY IN THE CIRCUITS AND POSSIBLY DESTROY THE MICROCHIP WITH A MAGNET
THERE'S NO REASON AN X RAY COULDN'T IDENTIFY A CHIP IN YOUR BODY
DIRECTLY INTERACTING WITH THE CHIP WITH ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION IS NOT VERY PROBABLE WITHOUT THE CHIP HAVING SOME KIND OF ANTENNA DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO IT

I WOULDN'T WASTE TIME WORRYING ABOUT THIS KIND OF STUFF
YOU NEED TO LEAVE A BLANK LINE BETWEEN EACH FOR TO FORMAT IT PROPERLY I EAST ENTER TWICE OR PUT AN ASTERISK BEFORE EACH ONE TO MAKE A BULLET LIST

WHAT SORT OF PHYSICS ARE YOU INTERESTED IN
I WOULD SAY GET DOWN TO THE BASICS HOW DO MAGNETS WORK

AND THEN ADD SOMETHING ABOUT ANTIMATTER AND HOW MAGNETISM AND ANTIMATTER CAN BE RELATED
HOW ABOUT ACCELERATION OF PARTICLES COMPACT ION ACCELERATORS ARE ALL THE RAGE
NOT ALL PHYSICS IS PARTICLE PHYSICS HOW ABOUT

GRAPHEME

TOPOLOGICAL INSULATORS

SUPERCONDUCTORS

2D MATERIALS 2D HETEROSTRUCTURE

ALTERNATE APPROACHES TO COMPUTING SPINTRONICS FLEXTRONICS VALLEYTRONICS PHONONICS POLARITONICS ETC

THC QUANTUM CASCADE LASERS

ENTANGLEMENT EXPERIMENTS

MS STUDENT HERE MY BOSS HE'S OFFICIALLY MY ADVISER BUT IN REALITY HE'S JUST THE GUY SIGNING MY PAYCHECK SUGGESTS THAT I STAY IN HIS LAB FOR MY PHD

I HAVE NO OTHER OPTIONS YET BUT I ALSO HAVE MY DOUBTS NOT ABOUT THE LAB I LOVE THESE GUYS BUT ABOUT THE COUNTRY LANGUAGE BARRIER IS A BITCH AND I'M AWFUL WITH LEARNING LANGUAGES I WANT TO EXPLORE OTHER OPTIONS BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD EVEN TELL HIM THAT I'M EXPLORING OTHER OPTIONS

WHAT DO I DO

I WORK WITH TWO OTHER GUYS AND I KNOW TWO OTHERS WHO CAN GIVE ME REC LETTERS SO I CAN APPLY TO PLACES WITHOUT MY BOSS FINDING OUT



IS THERE ANY RESEARCH FIELD THAT CONNECTS ASTROPHYSICS AND MATERIALS SCIENCE PARTICULARLY METAMATERIALS BETTER YET ASTROPHYSICS AND OPTOMECHANICS I'M GUESSING IT'LL HAVE SOMETHING TO DESIGNING INSTRUMENTATION

OR MODELING ASTROPHYSICAL PHENOMENON USING TRANSFORMATION OPTICS THAT SOUNDS REALLY COOL

SUGGESTIONS FOR STRONG RESEARCH GROUPS WOULD ALSO BE LOVELY
HOW IS FUNDING IN EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS RIGHT NOW I'M CONSIDERING GOING INTO A PHD PROGRAM AND IT SEEMS LIKE TRYING TO FIND THE PARTICULAR FIELDS I'M INTERESTED IN CAN HAVE A STABLE CAREER IN IS PRETTY IMPORTANT
DO PEOPLE NORMALLY APPLY FOR SUMMER INTERNSHIPS OR RESEARCH PROGRAMS DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF THEIR UNDERGRADS OR IS IT NORMALLY SOMETHING DONE IN THE SECOND OR THIRD YEAR
WHILE I'M FAMILIAR WITH CONCEPTS OF PHYSICS I'M NOT AS WELL VERSED IN THE SUBJECT AS I'D LIKE TO BE ESPECIALLY ELEMENTARY PARTICLES AND QUANTUM MECHANICS AS SOMEONE WHO IS PLANNING ON ATTENDING UNIVERSITY LATER IN LIFE WHAT SHOULD I LEARN NOW OR READ THAT WILL TEACH ME MORE THAN AN AMATEUR OR FOR BEGINNERS BOOK WOULD TEACH ME
HI ALL I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT MY DUAL DEGREES AND THEIR APPLICATION TO MEDICAL PHYSICS

I'M CURRENTLY A SOPHOMORE AND I'M IN A PROGRAM FOR A BA IN PHYSICS AND A BS IN ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING WHEN I CAME TO COLLEGE I WAS CERTAIN THAT I ONLY WANTED TO DO ENGINEERING AND I JUST WANTED THE PHYSICS DEGREE TO SUPPLEMENT MY RESUME BUT NOW THAT I'VE TAKEN A BIT OF PHYSICS CLASSES I REALLY ENJOY IT I AM NOW CURRENTLY DOING RESEARCH IN NUCLEAR PHYSICS THROUGH A NATIONAL LABORATORY DOING THIS HAS OPENED MY EYES TO THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF NUCLEAR PHYSICS AND PARTICLE ACCELERATORS AND I AM NOW THINKING THAT THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO GET INTO

I HAVE BEEN PLANNING ON GOING TO GRAD SCHOOL FOR A WHILE NOW SO THERE'S NO NEED TO CLARIFY ON THAT BUT I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT MY DEGREE IN PHYSICS ONLY BEING A BA GETTING A BS IS POSSIBLE BUT I'M NOT SURE I CAN AFFORD TO TAKE SUMMER CLASSES AND THAT MY ENGINEERING DEGREE IS ELECTRICAL IF I WERE TO SWITCH MY ENGINEERING FIELD WHICH I REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO I STILL FIND ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING FASCINATING IT WOULD BE A BACKTRACK BECAUSE I HAVE ALREADY MISSED SOME OF THE REQUIRED CLASSES SO I GUESS I'M JUST CURIOUS IF I'M GOING TO BE OKAY GOING INTO GRAD SCHOOL OR IF I SHOULD MAKE SOME CHANGES

LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS THINK

HER AGE WOULD BE A NICE START
I'VE DONE THIS SOME ADVICE

MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS ARE THE BREAD AND BUTTER OF DERIVATIVE PRICING IN ADDITION TO WHAT YOU'VE PROBABLY ALREADY SEEN WEST ROYAL TENSE THE ISING MODEL LEARN ABOUT SOME VARIANCE REDUCTION TECHNIQUES FOR MONTE CARLO

KNOW BACK AND FORTH

FOR TRADING JOBS KNOW A LOT OF THE SPECIFICS ABOUT OOP USUALLY WITH C THINGS LIKE WHAT IS THE COMPLEXITY OF ALGORITHM X HOW TO MANIPULATE VARIOUS DATA STRUCTURES EXPLAIN BASIC OOP CONCEPTS

MACHINE LEARNING IS BECOMING EVEN MORE IMPORT IN THIS SPACE LEARN AND BECOME A PRO WITH OR SOMETHING SIMILAR UNDERSTAND WHY YOU ARE DOING THINGS INSTEAD OF JUST BLINDLY APPLYING WHATEVER ML TECHNIQUE

SINCE PRICING EXOTIC DERIVATIVES HAVE TAKEN A TO JOBS IN RISK MANAGEMENT TRADITIONALLY SPEAKING JOBS IN RISK ARE A BIT LESS RESPECTED THAN OTHER ROLES AMONG PEOPLE IN THE FINANCE SPACE STILL MANY RISK JOBS ARE BECOMING AVAILABLE AND IT MAY BE A GOOD FOOT IN THE DOOR

PM IF YOU HAVE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS
R FINANCIALCAREERS MIGHT BE A BETTER CHOICE I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN KNOWING THIS AS WELL
FINANCE IS LARGELY ABOUT MANAGING RISK AND A BIG PART OF THAT IS MODELLING RISKS MATHEMATICALLY

LOOK UP BLACK SCHOLES AND STUDY STOCHASTIC CALCULUS WHICH ALSO SORT OF RELATES TO QUANTUM PHYSICS
YOU'D BE SURPRISED HOW MUCH MATH IS INVOLVED IN FINANCE THE BASICS OF OPTION PRICING MODELLING IS JUST DOING PATH INTEGRALS RECYCLING MANY TECHNIQUES FROM QM
PHYSICISTS DON'T TYPICALLY BECOME INVESTMENT BANKERS BECAUSE THAT PATH REQUIRES VERY LITTLE MATHEMATICAL SKILLS LONG HOURS AND EXCEL WIZARDRY IS WHAT THEY DO THE PERFECTLY CRAFTED CV AND GRADUATION FROM A TARGET SCHOOL PROGRAMME ARE THE TYPICAL REQUIREMENTS

THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT PHYSICISTS DON'T WORK AT INVESTMENT BANKS THEY DO BUT MORE TRADITIONALLY ON THE TRADING SIDE OF THINGS AS OPPOSED TO BANKING THAT IS OFTEN IN A ROLE DIRECTLY SUPPORTING TRADING AS QUANTS OR IN A CONTROL FUNCTION REVIEWING THE MATHEMATICAL MODELS THE PHYSICISTS WILL ALMOST INVARIABLY HOLD A PHD FOR WHY WOULD YOU HIRE SOMEONE WITH A MASTER'S IN PHYSICS IF YOU CAN GET SOMEONE WITH A MASTER'S IN FINANCIAL ENGINEERING WHO WENT TO SCHOOL FOR AND LEARNED EXACTLY ABOUT THE SUBJECT MATTER

FOR A TRADER IN A MARKET MAKING FUNCTION SO AN INVESTMENT BANK THERE'S PROBABLY NOT THAT MUCH COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IN HAVING A PHYSICS DEGREE SO I'D WAGER MOST ARE FROM A MORE DIRECTLY APPLICABLE BACKGROUND THAT SAID IT'S NOT UNCOMMON TO HAVE FORMER QUANTS AS TRADERS ON THE MORE EXOTIC SIDE OF THE BUSINESS

THIS ALL IS DIFFERENT ON THE BUY SIDE WHERE STATS AND MACHINE LEARNING AND ALL THAT IS KING IN A LARGE SUBSET OF FIRMS THE UNIVERSITY PROGRAMMES ARE NOT AS DEVELOPED TO CATER TO THE EXACT NEEDS THERE AND INDEED PHYSICISTS DO FIND AMPLE OPPORTUNITIES AS QUANT TRADERS QUANTS AND TECHNOLOGISTS AGAIN THE COMPETITION IS QUITE FIERCE AND HAVING A PHYSICS DEGREE WITHOUT EXTRACURRICULAR IS NOT GOING TO IMPRESS ANYONE MARKET YOURSELF AS A DATA SCIENTIST AND MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE BASIC TOOLS AND THEN SOME

IF YOU WANT TO WORK IN FINANCE WHY WOULD YOU STUDY PHYSICS
GET A MASTERS IN FINANCIAL ENGINEERING IF YOU WANT TO PRICE DERIVATIVES
I TOOK THIS PATH AS WELL TO BE HONEST ALL THE MATHEMATICS AND PRICING MODELS ARE USELESS THERE ARE A LOT OF SOCIAL VARIABLES THAT THE MATHEMATICS CANNOT UNDERSTAND FINANCE IS MAN MADE BUT THE MATH THAT WORKS WITH IT COMES FROM NATURAL EQUATIONS WITHOUT ANY OF THE COMPLEXITIES OF SOCIAL AWARENESS AND INTERACTION EAST G EQUATIONS ARE JUST A WEIRD FORM OF THE HEAT EQUATION STOCK PRICES MOVE UP OR DOWN BASED ON A HUGE AMOUNT OF VARIABLES THE MOVEMENTS ARE PRETTY MUCH RANDOM NOT FULLY BUT VERY CLOSE HOW CAN AN EQUATION THAT'S SUPPOSED TO MAKE A PREDICTION ON RANDOMNESS EVER BE CORRECT

YOU WANT TO BE A BANKER DROP THE PHYSICS AND START SCHMOOZING MAKING DEALS AND SELLING FINANCIAL PRODUCTS ON VERY LARGE SCALES IS WHERE THE MONEY AND OR PRESTIGE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS
HAVE A COUSIN WHO DID A PHYSICS UNDERGRAD AND A FINANCE MASTER'S

SHE'S WORTH MILLIONS MORE THAN ME NOW
SELL OUT
AWESOME THANK YOU FOR SHARING
I JUST FINISHED THE BOOK I'M A HUGE SEAN CARROLL FAN AND THIS BOOK WAS WELL WORTH THE TIME IT TOOK TO GET THROUGH I WILL CHECK THESE OUT TO SEE HOW HIS TALK COMPARES
YES ACTUALLY YOU SORT OF DEFINE THE DEGREE OF BROKENNESS OF A SYMMETRY BY THE DIVERGENCE OF THE CORRESPONDING NAETHER CURRENT J WHICH SHOULD BE ZERO IF CONSERVED

THIS IS WHAT IS DONE FOR EXAMPLE IN ANOMALIES WHICH IS WHEN A CLASSICAL SYMMETRY IS BROKEN BY QUANTUM EFFECTS TO PROBE THE ANOMALY YOU COMPUTE THE VACUUM EXPECTATION VALUE OF DIV J AND MANY PEOPLE JUST CALL THAT VALUE THE ANOMALY

DIV J IS CLEARLY DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE DRIFT OF THE CONSERVED QUANTITY AS YOU SAY
SLIGHTLY TANGENTIALLY A SIMILAR SITUATION OCCURS IN CD WHERE WE CAN FIND AN APPROXIMATE SU X SU SYMMETRY BETWEEN THE U D S QUARKS DUE TO THEIR LIGHTNESS RELATIVE TO THE C B T QUARKS IF THE U D S QUARKS WERE TRULY MASSLESS THERE WOULD BE AN EXACT SU X SU FLAVOUR SYMMETRY

THIS APPROXIMATE SYMMETRY IS HYPOTHESIZED TO BROKEN BY THE CD CONDENSATE DOWN TO A VECTOR SU GROUP WITH GENERATORS SO WE SHOULD HAVE MASSLESS BOSONS BY THEOREM IT TURNS OUT THAT ALL MASSES OF THIS MESON OCTET ARE NONZERO BECAUSE THIS IS NOT AN EXACT SYMMETRY BUT VERY LIGHT RELATIVE TO THE OTHER MESONS THEY ARE CALLED BOSONS AND THEIR SMALL MASSES ARE RELATED TO THE VERY SMALL U D S MASSES AND THEREFORE LOW DEGREE OF SYMMETRY BREAKING

THE EFFECT IS EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED IF WE JUST CONSIDER THE SU 2 X SU 2 SYMMETRY BETWEEN THE U D QUARKS IN THIS CASE THE ASSOCIATED
PSUEDO GOLDSTONE BOSONS THE PIONS HAVE REALLY SMALL MASSES RELATIVE TO ALMOST ALL THE OTHER PARTICLES IN THE SM DUE TO THIS BEING A PRETTY CLOSE TO EXACT SYMMETRY


SIMILARLY IN THE HIGGS MECHANISM THE MASSES OF ALL KNOWN ELEMENTARY PARTICLES TO AN EXTENT GOVERNED BY THE MAGNITUDE OF THE HIGGS VACUUM EXPECTATION VALUE WHICH CAN BE INTERPRETED AS THE DEGREE OF SPONTANEOUS SYMMETRY BREAKING THE CAVEAT HERE IS THAT THE YUKAWA COUPLINGS OF EACH PARTICLE TO THE HIGGS FIELD ALSO AFFECTS EACH MASS AND THESE ARE AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL ARBITRARY

UNFORTUNATELY I AM UNSURE OF AN EXACT RELATION BETWEEN THE DEGREE OF SYMMETRY VIOLATION AND THE CONSERVATION OF THE ASSOCIATED QUANTITY
SIMPLE VERSION

YOU CAN WRITE ANY MATRIX AS A SUM OF A PART PROPORTIONAL TO THE IDENTITY MATRIX AN ANTISYMMETRIC PART AND A TRACELESS SYMMETRIC PART AS YOU ROTATE IN 3D SPACE THESE THREE PARTS TRANSFORM INDEPENDENTLY OF ONE ANOTHER

IF YOUR MATRIX HAS TRACE THAT MEANS YOU INCLUDE SOME ISOTROPIC EFFECT IN ADDITION TO YOUR ANISOTROPIC TERM IF YOU HAVE LEARNED BASIC SOLID-STATE NMR YOU DECOMPOSED THE CHEMICAL SHIFT MATRIX INTO AN ISOTROPIC SHIFT AND A TRACELESS SYMMETRIC SHIFT ANISOTROPY FOR EXAMPLE

SINCE YOUR ORDER PARAMETER SHOULD BE ZERO IN THE ISOTROPIC PHASE BY DEFINITION YOU REMOVE THE ISOTROPIC COMPONENT BY FORCING THE MATRIX TO BE TRACELESS


GROUP THEORY VERSION IF YOU HAVE NOT TAKEN A LECTURE ON GROUP THEORY DO IT

AN ORDER PARAMETER IS ASSOCIATED TO THE SYMMETRY THE ORDERED PHASE BREAKS THE SYMMETRY THAT THE LIQUID CRYSTAL BREAKS WITH RESPECT TO THE ISOTROPIC LIQUID IS THE SPATIAL ROTATION SYMMETRY SO

YOUR ORDER PARAMETER SHOULD TRANSFORM UNDER THE BROKEN SYMMETRY GROUP IN A REASONABLE FASHION WHICH MEANS THAT IT MUST TRANSFORM IN AN IRREDUCIBLE REPRESENTATION IRRED OF SO

THE SIMPLEST IRRED ARE THE SCALARS MONOPOLES IN EM IN ATOMS NUMBERS DON'T CHANGE AS YOU ROTATE THEM BUT WE WANT SOMETHING THAT DOES CHANGE

NEXT COME VECTORS DIPOLES THEY CHANGE SIGN AS YOU ROTATE BY DEGREES WHICH IS ALSO NOT WHAT WE WANT

THEN COME THE TRACELESS SYMMETRIC TENSORS QUADRUPLES THEY DEPEND ON DIRECTION BUT ROTATING BY DEGREES DOES NOT CHANGE THEM THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT

PHYSICS OF RUBBER ELASTICITY IS A CLASSIC TEXT SHOULD BE A GOOD STARTING POINT VERY CONCISE INTRODUCTION
ELASTICITY THEORY PROVIDES YOU WITH A SET OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS THAT SHOULD TELL YOU EVERYTHING ABOUT THE MOVEMENT OF THE MATERIAL AFTER DEFORMATION AND THE STRESSES AT EACH POINT AND SO ON TO CORRECTLY IMPLEMENT BOUNDARY CONDITIONS IS A TERRIBLE DRAG IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY BUT FOR SIMPLE SHAPES YOU CAN CHEAT A BIT I THINK YOU CAN FIND THE BASICS IN KITTEL BUT I'M NOT SURE DON'T HAVE IT NEAR ME CURRENTLY
I WOULD START BY LEARNING ABOUT THE MODULUSES MODULI MODULES

MODULUS
BULK MODULUS
SHEAR MODULUS
IF THE RUBBER IS SHEETS OR BANDS AND YOU ONLY CARE ABOUT ITS SHAPE ITS A MINIMAL SURFACE PROBLEM AND YOU COULD USE VARIATIONAL CALCULUS
YOU'D BE BETTER OFF ASKING AT BUT FROM EXPERIENCE THE AVERAGE IS A LITTLE ABOVE I DID MYSELF
ALSO HIGH ENERGY THEORY IS FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD VERY DIFFICULT TO GET INTO YOU'LL PROBABLY NEED A AGRE SCORE A BIT HIGHER THAN MIDDLE OF THE PACK

I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF MY FIRST YEAR OF AN EXPERIMENTAL AMO PHYSICS PHD FROM MY EXPERIENCE HIGH ENERGY THEORY IS A LITTLE MORE COMPETITIVE BUT I HOPE THIS CAN BE HELPFUL I APPLIED TO SCHOOLS OF WHICH ARE ON YOUR LIST I HAD PRETTY SIMILAR CREDENTIALS AS YOU AND I WAS ACCEPTED TO SCHOOLS I WILL TELL YOU THAT A HIGH AGRE SCORE WILL HELP QUITE A LOT WITH THE BIG-NAME SCHOOLS LIKE MIT STANFORD AND HARVARD BUT IT IS NOT AS IMPORTANT FOR SOME OF THE OTHERS ON YOUR LIST IF YOU END UP GETTING A WORSE SCORE THAN YOU HAD HOPED YOU CAN STILL GET IN TO SOME EXCELLENT SCHOOLS WITH YOUR RESUME MY AGRE SCORE WAS UNDER AND I WAS STILL ACCEPTED TO MY TOP CHOICE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I WOULD RECOMMEND APPLYING TO AT LEAST OR SCHOOLS IF YOU CAN AFFORD THE APPLICATION FEES THOUGH MORE DOES NOT HURT
WHEN YOU ARE APPLYING DON'T JUST SAY I'M INTERESTED IN HIGH ENERGY THEORY YOU WANT TO SAY I'M INTERESTED IN PROF WORK READ SOME OF HIS PAPERS AND MAYBE HOW IT CONNECTS TO SOMETHING YOU DID AS AN UNDERGRAD WHEN THEY READ THE LETTER YOU WANT TO MAKE IT SEEM LIKE YOU ARE CHOOSING THEM BECAUSE YOU ARE INTERESTED IN SPECIFIC RESEARCH WITH THEM THAT YOU COULD GET NOWHERE ELSE RATHER THAN BLINDLY THROWING DARTS AND HOPE SOME HIT
YOU DON'T APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW DENSE HET IS APPLYING TO SCHOOLS WILL NOT HELP IF HALF OF THEM ARE TOP PROGRAMS AND YOU DESCRIBE YOURSELF AS LOOK FOR SOME MORE REALISTIC OPTIONS AND LOOK FOR PROFESSORS WHO ARE DOING INTERESTING WORK AND HAVE OPEN SPOTS IN THEIR GROUPS RATHER THAN THE NAME RECOGNITION IT WOULDN'T HURT TO EMAIL SOME OF THESE PROFESSORS BUT IF I'M BEING HONEST YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS SEVERAL MONTHS AGO
MIGHT BE OVERKILL WHAT I'D DO IS LOOK AT THE RESEARCH OF EACH DEPARTMENT EMAIL SOME PROFESSORS YOU MIGHT LIKE TO WORK WITH AND FROM THERE YOU COULD MAKE SOME CUTS LIKE IF YOU COULDN'T REALLY FIND A PROFESSOR YOU COULD SEE YOURSELF SPENDING YEARS WITH DON'T APPLY

PS I ALSO DID MY UNDERGRAD AT ILLINOIS AND I'M CURRENTLY A GRAD STUDENT AT ONE OF THE SCHOOLS YOU LISTED
DELETED
WHY DOES IT DETECT ANY RADIATION FROM THE COLD WATER I GET THAT IT'S NOT AT ABSOLUTE ZERO BUT IT'S STILL PRESUMABLY COLDER THAN THE AIR FROM WHICH THE DEVICE ISN'T DETECTING ANYTHING
MANY INTERESTING LITTLE THINGS LIKE THIS ALL OVER YOUTUBE


NANOMETALLURGY SAC
RANK EXPLORE
PREREQUISITES PROBABILITY MECHANICS DOCTRINE INITIATIVE
LEADS TO MATTER COMPRESSION QUANTUM MACHINERY

OUR SCIENTISTS NOW USE FRACTAL THEORY TO TEACH THE MOLECULES TO ASSUME OR RESUME A PARTICULAR FORM SUBSTANCES OF AMAZING STRENGTH BECOME SIMPLE ONCE THE FORMULAE ARE PROPERLY COMPUTED IN THE BIBLE COLOSSIANS CORAZON SANTIAGO THE COUNCIL OF WAR
HOW GENERAL IS IT PROBABLY NOT REALLY FOR CARBON ATOMS MAYBE DREXLER OR THOSE WELL AWARE OF THAT ANGLE ET AL CAN HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT ACTUALLY BUILDING SHIT THOSE DIAMONDOID DEVICES HAVE IN GLORIOUS CAPABILITIES EDIT I THINK NOT

THE OTHER MORE LIKELY ROUTE TO GENERAL MOLECULAR NANOTECHNOLOGY IS STILL VIA BIOTECHNOLOGY
WHY DON'T PHYSICISTS CONSIDER RUNNING FOR OFFICE

BECAUSE THEY ARE OBJECTIVE RATIONAL AND INTELLIGENT PEOPLE
AS A PHYSICIST I CAN SAY THAT PHYSICISTS ARE JUST PEOPLE LIKE ANYONE ELSE GET MORE THAN ONE OF THEM IN A ROOM AND THERE WILL BE POLITICS NEPOTISM AND ANYTHING REALLY THAT YOU'D ASSOCIATE WITH ANY OTHER GROUP OF PEOPLE HAVING TRAINING IN PHYSICS IS ALL THAT YOU CAN CONCLUDE FROM SOMEONE WHO CALLS THEMSELVES A PHYSICIST NOT THAT THEY ARE GOOD AT ANYTHING ELSE
BEING A SUCCESFUL LEADER OF A COUNTRY REQUIRES A VERY DIVERSE SKILLET MANY FACETS OF WHICH ARE ON THE SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE SIDE RATHER THAN MATHEMATICAL INTELLIGENCE YOU HAVE TO BE GREAT WITH PEOPLE COMMUNICATE WITH LEADERS OF OTHER NATIONS COPE WITH HUGE AMOUNTS OF STRESS AND MANY OTHER STUFF SURE A PHYSICIST COULD HAVE THOSE PROPERTIES HOWEVER A TALENT FOR A VERY SPECIFIC TYPE OF ABSTRACT THINKING DOES NOT NECESSARILY SAY ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE SOMEONE WITH EXPERIENCE IN ECONOMICS AND GEOPOLITICS THAN SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO CALCULATE PATH INTEGRALS YOU COULD ARGUE THAT BEING GOOD AT PHYSICS SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR OVERALL INTELLIGENCE BUT THAT'S A THIN POINT IN MY OPINION
THEY DO ANGELA MERKEL IS A PHYSICIST

IN CASE ANYONE DOESN'T KNOW HER SHE'S THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR
BECAUSE BEING OBJECTIVE RATIONAL AND INTELLIGENT DOES NOT BRING IN VOTES
POLITICS IS WAY WAY MORE COMPLICATED THAN WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE FROM THE OUTSIDE JUST LIKE PHYSICS IF YOU HANDLE A SINGLE SITUATION WRONG OR LOSE YOUR COOL YOU LOSE EVERYTHING AND I MEAN IT IF YOU CAN MAKE OTHERS LOSE THEIR COOL YOU HAVE A HUGE ADVANTAGE THEN YOU NEED TO BE A GOOD NEGOTIATOR BEING ABLE TO MAKE RATIONAL DECISIONS IS OF NO USE IF YOU CAN'T EVEN CONVINCE ANYONE ELSE THAT YOUR IDEA IS THE BEST ON TOP OF THAT YOU NEED TO ACTUALLY KNOW PEOPLE LAWS LOOPHOLES CONNECTIONS

I'D SUGGEST YOU CALL A FEW POLITICIANS THAT ARE REPRESENTING YOU AND ASK THEM TO MEET YES THAT CAN ACTUALLY HAPPEN AND EXPLAIN THEIR JOB TO YOU IT IS PRETTY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU THINK IT IS

ON A SIDENOTE ANGELA MERKEL IS A PHYSICIST AND THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF GERMANY RICHARD VON WEIZSÄCKER WAS TOO
STEVE CHU WAS THE SECRETARY OF ENERGY
BILL FOSTER A CONGRESSMAN FROM ILLINOIS WAS A PARTICLE PHYSICIST WHO WORKED AT FERMILAB
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE NOT OBJECTIVE OR RATIONAL PEOPLE ARE EMOTIVE THEY WANT THEIR EMOTIONS VALIDATED AND THEIR POSITION EMPATHIZED WITH NOT DISMISSED WITH A WAVE OF THE HAND

POLITICS IS ALL ABOUT MAKING PEOPLE FEEL GOOD MEETING IN THE MIDDLE AND GETTING THINGS DONE AS WELL AS KNOWING HOW TO SEIZE THE MOMENT

PHYSICISTS GENERALLY AREN'T FANS OF SUCH MIDDLE GROUNDS THERE IS ONE OBJECTIVE REALITY AND ONE TRUTH THERE IS A SINGLE OPTIMAL WAY TO DO THINGS AND THE REASONS FOR THAT ARE X Y Z

JUST MY 2 CENTS
I USED TO THINK THIS BUT MORE SO FOR INTENTIONS THAN COMPETENCY IF YOU HAVE DEDICATED YOUR LIFE TO UNDERSTAND THE WORLD INSTEAD OF UNDERSTANDING THE ECONOMY THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR YOUR PERSPECTIVE HOWEVER THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT DEDICATED THEIR LIFE TO A DEEPER COMPLEXITY OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNIVERSE AND ARE FANTASTIC IN POLITICS

IN CANADA OUR PRIME MINISTER HAS A BACKGROUND IN ACTING I HONESTLY AM STARTING TO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A FANTASTIC BACKGROUND FOR A LEADER BECAUSE AS BEEN STATED IN THE COMMENT SECTION YOU SURROUND YOURSELF WITH EXPERT ADVISORS YOUR JOB IS TO ACT THE ROLE AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A GOOD MENTALITY AND INTENTIONS GOING INTO OFFICE ALL YOU REALLY NEED ARE GOOD ADVISORS AND CHARISMA
THAT'S A GOOD POINT HOWEVER DOING RESEARCH IN PHYSICS TAKES A LIFETIME OF DEDICATION SO I COULD ONLY SEE PHYSICISTS WHO DROP OUT OF RESEARCH TO BE ABLE TO EVEN CONSIDER SUCH A THING
I THINK THE SUPERLATIVES VIRTUES YOU'RE ATTACHING TO PHYSICISTS ARE MORE FEATURES OF THE FIELD ITSELF THAN THE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN IT PHYSICS MORE SO THAN OTHER FIELDS IS GOOD AT REDUCING NATURAL PHENOMENA TO MATHEMATICAL CURIOSITIES AND FINDING TRUTHS BUT WHAT ALLOWS PHYSICISTS TO DO IT IS THE AVAILABILITY OF AMPLE GOOD EXPERIMENTAL DATA THANKS TO WHICH THEY CAN REACH THE CORRECT CONCLUSION WITHOUT HAVING TO APPLY THE KIND OF CAREFUL REASONING SCIENTISTS IN OBSERVATIONAL SCIENCES SOCIOLOGY PALEONTOLOGY ETC ARE TRAINED FOR THIS MAKES PHYSICISTS LESS INHERENTLY QUALIFIED FOR PUBLIC OFFICE THAN SCHOLARS OF OTHER SCIENCES NATURAL OR SOCIAL

I'D SAY I WOULD LIKE MORE PSYCHOLOGY PROFESSORS IN GOVERNMENT POSITIONS BECAUSE THEIR KNOWLEDGE IS MORE FIT TO THE KIND OF PROBLEMS THEY'D FACE BUT EVEN THEY ARE NOT A GUARANTEED TO BE OPTIMALLY COMPETENT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWING A LOT ABOUT MARTIAL ARTS AND ACTUALLY PRACTICING MARTIAL ARTS

EDIT VOCABULARY
I REJECT THE PREMISE

I GREW UP IN A DISTRICT REPRESENTED BY A PHYSICIST IN THIS LAST ELECTION I VOTED FOR ANOTHER PHYSICIST IN A DIFFERENT STATE FOR CONGRESS AS WELL

I SURMISE THAT THE FRACTION OF PHYSICISTS IN CONGRESS IS PRETTY CLOSE TO THE FRACTION OF AMERICANS WHO ARE PHYSICISTS
FOR 2 ATOMS THAT ARE FAR APART THE INTERACTION ENERGY IS SMALL AND THE WAVEFUNCTIONS OF THE ELECTRONS ARE CLOSE TO THE WAVEFUNCTIONS OF THE UNCOUPLED ATOMS

WHEN YOU BRING THE ATOMS CLOSER TOGETHER THEY START TO INTERACT STRONGLY AND THE ELECTRON WAVEFUNCTIONS WILL BE VERY DIFFERENT MOLECULAR BONDS AND ANTIBONDS

YOU CAN DEFINE THE QUANTUM BOUNDARY FOR THE PAULI EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE BY DEFINING A PARAMETER THAT WILL DETERMINE IF THE ATOMS ARE STRONGLY COUPLED OR WEAKLY COUPLED

THEORETICALLY THE UNIVERSE IS A BIG QUANTUM SYSTEM BUT THE INTERACTION ENERGY BETWEEN AN ATOM IN WASHINGTON AND AN ATOM ON THE MOON IS MUCH MUCH SMALLER THAN THE INTERNAL ENERGY OF THE ATOM IF THAT MAKES ANY SENSE IN THE MATHEMATICAL LANGUAGE OF QUANTUM MECHANICS WE SAY THAT THE ELEMENTS OF THE HAMILTONIAN ARE SMALL COMPARED TO THE DIAGONAL ONES A PURELY DIAGONAL HAMILTONIAN WOULD BE THE REPRESENTATION OF AN UNPERTURBED ATOM THE ELEMENTS ARE THE PERTURBATIVE INTERACTIONS

SO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION YOU HAVE TO ASK WHAT DEFINES AN INTERACTION WHEN CAN WE NEGLECT THE INTERACTION THIS WILL TELL YOU HOW TO INTERPRET THE PAULI EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE IN YOUR SITUATION
THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH THE ELI VERSION OF THE PAULI EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE IT'S A NICE SIMPLE WAY OF STATING THE PAULI EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE NO IDENTICAL FERMIONS CAN EVER BE IN THE SAME STATE BUT IT ISN'T VERY PRECISE YOU CAN GET CONFUSED LIKE IN YOUR EXAMPLE WELL I HAVE ONE ATOM WITH AN ELECTRON IN THIS STATE OVER HERE AND I HAVE ANOTHER ATOM WITH ANOTHER ELECTRON OVER THERE IN THE SAME STATE IS THAT ALLOWED IF THE 2 ATOMS OR SEPARATED OR NOT OR WHAT


THE MORE PRECISE DEFINITION OF THE PAULI EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE IN THE CONTEXT IS THAT THE WAVEFUNCTION MUST BE UNDER THE EXCHANGE OF ANY TWO IDENTICAL FERMIONS MATHEMATICALLY LET XN REPRESENT THE COORDINATES OF N INDEPENDENT PARTICLES THEN THERE IS A WAVEFUNCTION FOR THIS SYSTEM PSI XN THERE IS ONLY EVER ONE WAVEFUNCTION AND IT DESCRIBES THE ENTIRE SYSTEM ANY SMALLER SYSTEMS CONTAINED IN THE TOTAL SYSTEM DO NOT STICKLY SPEAKING HAVE THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT WAVEFUNCTIONS WHAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE POINTED OUT IS THAT IF SUBSYSTEMS A AND B ARE WEAKLY INTERACTING THEN WE CAN APPROXIMATELY WRITE THE TOTAL WAVEFUNCTION AS A PRODUCT OF A FUNCTION THAT DESCRIBES SUBSYSTEM A TIMES A FUNCTION THAT DESCRIBES SUBSYSTEM B

ARMED WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE WE CAN STATE THE PAULI EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE MORE PRECISELY IN A MATHEMATICAL WAY THE PAULI PRINCIPLE REQUIRES THAT PSI XI X XN PSI X XI XN FOR XI AND X THE COORDINATES OF 2 IDENTICAL FERMIONS SWAPPING XI WITH X IN THE WAVEFUNCTION MUST BE EQUIVALENT TO MULTIPLYING THE WHOLE THING BY

WITH THIS STATEMENT OF THE PRINCIPLE ALL THIS WORRY ABOUT WHETHER WE HAVE OR 2 OR SYSTEMS FALLS AWAY WHAT WE REQUIRE IS THAT FOR THE WAVEFUNCTION THAT DESCRIBES THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE SWAPPING ANY 2 IDENTICAL FERMIONS MUST BE EQUIVALENT TO MULTIPLYING THE ORIGINAL WAVEFUNCTION BY IF YOU HAVE THE SITUATION WHERE THE WAVEFUNCTION CAN BE WRITTEN AS A PRODUCT OF 2 APPROXIMATELY FACTORS THE SAME PRINCIPLE APPLIES BOTH WITHIN EACH AND BETWEEN THE TWO
YOU'RE ASKING GOOD QUESTIONS BUT YOU SHOULD REALIZE THAT YOU CAN ASK THE SAME EXACT QUESTIONS IN CLASSICAL MECHANICS

ULTIMATELY IT'S UP TO YOU TO CHOOSE WHAT YOUR SYSTEM IS AND WHAT THE SURROUNDINGS ARE

OF COURSE IN THE CASE OF QM AND IDENTICAL PARTICLES PAULI EXCLUSION COMPLICATES THINGS SINCE ALL IDENTICAL PARTICLES SHOULD BE DESCRIBED BY A SINGLE ANTI SYMMETRIZED WAVEFUNCTION FOR FERMIONS BOSONS

ANOTHER THING THAT HELPS TO THINK ABOUT IS THAT IF YOU HAVE ONE ELECTRON WITH YOU AND ANOTHER ON MARS THE OVERLAP BETWEEN THEIR SPATIAL WAVEFUNCTIONS IS VERY SMALL SO FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES YOU CAN STUDY YOUR SYSTEM ELECTRON ON EARTH AND IGNORE THE SURROUNDINGS ELECTRON ON MARS
WHEN YOU HAVE TWO ATOMS WITH ELECTRONS IN THE SAME STATE THE ELECTRONS ARE IN DIFFERENT PLACES SO THAT DOESN'T LEAD TO ISSUES WITH THE PAULI PRINCIPLE

IS THERE SOME QUANTUM STATE RELATED TO LOCATION SO THAT ELECTRONS THAT ARE FAR AWAY FROM EACH OTHER CAN HAVE ALL OTHER STATES IDENTICAL TO EACH OTHER WITHOUT VIOLATING PAULI

YES

CONSEQUENTLY THERE'S NO NEED TO DEFINE THE BOUNDARIES OF A QUANTUM SYSTEM MOTIVATED BY THE PAULI PRINCIPLE
YOU MAKE A MODEL AND THEN YOU REMOVE THINGS GRADUALLY UNTIL YOU KEEP THE DESIRED BEHAVIOR SPECTRA ETC WITH THE LEAST ASSUMPTIONS POSSIBLE SO MAYBE THE COUPLING BETWEEN THE MOTIONS OF TWO VERY DISTANT ATOMS ARE NOT RELEVANT THIS DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING TO MODEL
I THINK YOU MISUNDERSTAND WHAT A QUANTUM STATE OF AN ELECTRON IS

IF YOU HAVE TWO HYDROGEN ATOMS THAT ARE INFINITELY FAR APART SUCH THAT THEIR INTERACTION IS ZERO THEN THE EIGENSTATE OF YOUR ELECTRONS ARE LABELLED BY THE ATOM THEY ARE SITTING ON IN ADDITION TO THE USUAL QUANTUM NUMBERS FOR ATOMIC ORBITALS

SO YOUR STATE WOULD BE FOR EXAMPLE ATOM ORBITAL SPIN UP YOU CAN THEN HAVE ANOTHER ELECTRON IN ATOM 2 ORBITAL SPIN UP SINCE THIS IS A DISTINCT STATE

SINCE OUR TWO ATOMS DO NOT INTERACT AT ALL IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE IF WE TREAT THEM AS ONE LARGER SYSTEM OR TWO SEPARATE ONES

OF COURSE IF WE BRING THE TWO ATOMS CLOSE TO ONE ANOTHER THEY WILL INTERACT AND POSSIBLY FOR A MOLECULE IN WHICH CASE YOU SHOULD NOT TREAT THEM AS SEPARATE SYSTEMS ANYMORE
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT A STATE IS FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE PAULI EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE IT'S A LITTLE BIT MESSY BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF QUANTUM UNCERTAINTY BUT IF TWO THINGS ARE DEFINITELY IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS THEN THEY ARE IN DIFFERENT STATES

THE SORT OF STATE THAT PAULI EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE TALKS ABOUT IS SUBJECT TO THE SAME SORTS OF QUANTUM DUALITIES AS PARTICLES ARE IN PARTICULAR THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO PARTITION THE STATE SPACE AND WHAT THE WORLD LOOKS LIKE IN TERMS OF POSITION STATES MAY SEEM VERY DIFFERENT THAN THAT WHAT THE WORLD LOOKS LIKE IN TERMS OF MOMENTUM STATES

REGARDING THE QUESTION ABOUT QUANTUM SYSTEMS ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT IS TO SAY THAT EVERYTHING WE OBSERVE IS ALL PART OF THE SAME QUANTUM SYSTEM AND THAT WHEN WE CONSIDER A SINGLE ATOM OR SOME OTHER SUBSYSTEM WHAT WE'RE REALLY DOING IS MAKING AN APPROXIMATION BY ASSUMING THAT STUFF OUTSIDE THE SUBSYSTEM DOESN'T HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE WHETHER THIS KIND OF APPROXIMATION MAKES GOOD PREDICTIONS CAN THEN BE TESTED BY EXPERIMENT


WOW THANKS THIS IS AMAZING
THAT'S A SHORT PAPER
WITH SANDOVAL VALLARTA A MEXICAN PHYSICIST
NOT CONTENT WITH BREAKING RSA WITH QUANTUM COMPUTING PETER SHOR SEEMS TO HAVE HIS EYES SET ON CRYPTO NOW
BACKGROUND I'VE BEEN DOING ASTROPHYSICS PROFESSIONALLY THROUGH UPS AND DOWNS FOR OVER YEARS SINCE PASSING MY DUALS

WHAT MOTIVATES YOU TO DO YOUR WORK RESEARCH

I DO ASTROPHYSICS BECAUSE IT'S REALLY AFFING COOL I LOVE BEING ABLE TO WREST SECRETS FROM THE UNIVERSE THROUGH ANALYSIS AND TO DISCOVER THINGS THAT NOBODY HAS EVER KNOWN BEFORE I LOVE BEING ABLE TO INTERACT AND ENGAGE IN STYLIZED INTELLECTUAL COMBAT WITH SOME OF THE SMARTEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD

THAT SAID I HAVE FREQUENTLY GONE THROUGH DOWN PERIODS WHEN I AM NOT FULLY ENGAGED WITH THE WORK GENERALLY THESE INVOLVE RECOVERING FROM SOME PARTICULARLY INTENSE PROJECT OR ANALYSIS IT HAPPENS TO EVERYONE I WAS TOLD BY MY PHYSICIST DAD THAT EINSTEIN HIMSELF GOT REMOTIVATED AFTER HIS QUALIFYING EXAMS

2 WHAT VALUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO YOU COME TO FRUITION IN YOUR WORK

THE SPIRIT OF INQUIRY AND THE THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE ARE TERRIFIC IT'S HARD TO OVER EMPHASIZE JUST HOW AWESOME AND UNUSUAL IT IS TO WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO A BELIEVE IN A REAL WORLD AND A REAL TRUTH THAT EXISTS INDEPENDENT OF ALL OF US B ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN A SEARCH FOR TRUTH IN THAT WORLD AND C CAN DISTINGUISH BETWEEN ATTACKS ON A PARTICULAR IDEA AND ATTACKS ON THEIR PERSONAL SELVES THESE VALUES WHEN DISSEMINATED THROUGH SOCIETY MAKE SOCIETY BETTER

WE REALLY DO LIVE IN A SINGLE REAL WORLD THAT EXISTS INDEPENDENT OF US AND THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD IS THE BEST TECHNIQUE HUMANS HAVE EVER PRODUCED TO DISCOVER MORE ABOUT IT SPINOFFS FROM SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY INCLUDE PRETTY MUCH EVERY ASPECT OF OUR SOCIETY FROM BASICS LIKE HAVING ENOUGH FERTILIZER TO PLANT CROPS TO FEED THE WORLD TO ESOTERICA LIKE HOW TO MAKE AND ORGANIZE BILLIONS OF TRANSISTORS INTO SOMETHING LIKE REDDIN THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD HAS IN JUST YEARS TAKEN US TO A WORLD THAT WOULD SEEM ABSOLUTELY MAGICAL AT THE START WE HAVE CLAIRAUDIENCE CLAIRVOYANCE LONGEVITY THE LIMITED ABILITY TO RESURRECT THE DEAD HUMAN FLIGHT ENOUGH FOOD AND A THOUSAND OTHER THINGS AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THAT INQUIRY CONTINUING THAT LINE IS THE BEST WAY TO ENSURE THAT HUMANITY CONTINUES TO ADVANCE AND OVERCOME THE PROBLEMS THAT FACE US TODAY

BAD THOUGH CURRENT PROBLEMS LIKE GLOBAL WARMING MIGHT SEEM WE MUST REMEMBER THAT HUMANITY HAS FACED DOWN EXISTENTIAL CRISES BEFORE THE BLACK PLAGUE SMALLPOX BLIGHTS THAT CAUSED FAMINES HORRIBLE WARS SUCH AS THE MONGOL INVASION AND A THOUSAND OTHER THINGS HAVE THREATENED HUMANITY AND MODERN SCIENCE HAS TACKLED ALL OF THOSE ONE BY ONE OUR BEST BET FOR SURVIVING THE NEXT ROUND OF DIFFICULTIES IS TO LEARN YET MORE ABOUT THE WORLD AND USE THAT KNOWLEDGE TO TACKLE THE PROBLEMS

HOW CAN I BETTER THE WORLD AS A PHYSICIST

BY CARRYING OUT YOUR RESEARCH AND DISSEMINATING BOTH YOUR WAY OF THINKING AND YOUR RESEARCH ITSELF TO THE WORLD AT LARGE PHYSICS IS HARD AND MOSTLY QUITE ABSTRACTED FROM EVERYDAY LIFE AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT INDIVIDUALS DO BECAUSE THEY ENJOY IT OTHER FIELDS SUCH AS ENGINEERING OR COMPUTER SCIENCE OR POLITICS OFFER A MORE DIRECT CONNECTION TO THE CURRENT STATE OF YOUR LOCAL ENVIRONMENT REMEMBER THAT THE ENTERPRISE OF PHYSICS ITSELF IS A SERIES OF LONG SHOTS EACH INDIVIDUAL SCIENTIST HAS A TINY CHANCE OF PRODUCING A TRULY NEW DISCOVERY THAT MAY AFFECT THE WORLD BUT BOTH THE WAY OF THINKING AND THE COMBINED EFFORTS OF THE ENTIRE FIELD ADVANCE THE WORLD PALPABLY AND STEADILY

SO THINKING OF THE LONG GAME SERVING AS AN EXAMPLE TO OTHERS OF CLEAR THINKING AND SPREADING KNOWLEDGE RATHER THAN SUPERSTITION AND DARKNESS THESE ARE THE BEST WAYS YOU CAN BETTER THE WORLD AS A PHYSICIST
THIS MIGHT HELP

AS FAR AS MOTIVATION IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO PUBLISHING IT'S REALLY REWARDING WORKING ON A PROJECT AND SEEING IT COME TO FRUITION AND HOW TO BETTER THE WORLD AS A PHYSICIST WELL PHYSICS IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO SOLVE COMPLEX PROBLEMS SO YOU HAVE TO FIND ONE THAT MEANS SOMETHING TO YOU AND WORK FOR IT

FEYNMAN SAID SOMETHING LIKE PHYSICS IS LIKE SEX IT MIGHT HAVE SOME USEFUL PURPOSE BUT THAT'S NOT WHY WE DO IT

NOW MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT AS BRILLIANT AS FEYNMAN SO PHYSICS IS NOT AS FUN FOR US AS IT WAS FOR HIM BUT IT'S WORTH CONSIDERING THE IDEA THAT IF FUN OR INTELLECTUAL ENJOYMENT IS NOT A BIG PART OF YOUR MOTIVATION THEN MAYBE PHYSICS ISN'T THE BEST CAREER PATHOLOGY

ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S EASY TO GET BURNT OUT IN GRAD SCHOOL AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU DON'T LOVE PHYSICS BURNOUT CAN BE DEALT WITH BY EASING UP IF ONLY WE WERE FREE TO DO PHYSICS AS A HOBBY AT OUR OWN PACE RATHER THAN RUINING IT BY MAKING IT A JOB
ASSUMING YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT ACADEMIA

I GET WHERE YOU COME FROM HAVING BEEN THERE MYSELF TO BE A PHYSICIST OR ANY OTHER SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINE IN AN ACADEMIC SETTING YOU NEED MORE THAN INTELLIGENCE AND KNOWLEDGE YOU NEED TO BE AND THIS CANNOT BE TAUGHT IN MY EXPERIENCE JUST LIKE SOME PEOPLE ARE LEFT HANDED SOME PEOPLE CAN MOTIVATE THEMSELVES WITHOUT EXTERIOR FORCES OR PEER RECOGNITION OR WHAT NOT

THAT SAID I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT MY GROUND STATE SELF MUCH PREFERS TANGIBLE RELATIVELY FAST RESULTS TO EXTREMELY THEORETICAL AND FAR-AWAY APPLICATIONS I'M CONSIDERING A CAREER IN MEDICINE WILL MOST PROBABLY NEVER GET IN BUT WHO KNOWS THIS PROFESSION HAS TO ME A GREAT RATIO OF INTELLECTUAL WORK TO RESULTS A PHYSICIAN NEEDS TO KNOW A LOT OF THINGS BUT THIS IS BREADTH FIRST KNOWLEDGE NOT LIKE SOMEONE DOING A PHD THEREFORE THE IMPRESSION IS THAT YOU CAN BE MORE USEFUL IN A WIDER VARIETY OF SITUATIONS AND SEE THE RESULTS OF YOUR INTERVENTIONS MUCH MORE EASILY AND FASTER THAN YOU WOULD DURING A PHD NOTE THAT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES FEEL COMPLETELY THE OPPOSITE THEY WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING REMOTELY EXPERIMENTAL

THIS HAS GREAT APPEAL TO ME I WILL NEVER BE A GREAT MATHEMATICIAN BUT I WILL ALWAYS LOVE MATHEMATICS I WILL NEVER BE A GREAT PHYSICIST BUT I WILL ALWAYS LOVE PHYSICS ETC I THINK I COULD BE A GREAT PHYSICIAN HOWEVER AS THAT REQUIRES A DISTINCT SKILLET I REDUCTIVELY SEE THE PROFESSION AS BEING A SORT OF BODY MECHANIC PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR AND THAT APPEALS TO ME

SO DON'T FIGHT THE UNIVERSE IF YOU LOST YOUR MOTIVATION FOR DOING SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH THAT IS FINE SOME PEOPLE FIGURE THEMSELVES OUT AT A VERY YOUNG AGE OTHERS TAKE MORE TIME IF AFTER YOUR MSC YOU DON'T WANT TO CONTINUE DOING RESEARCH THEN SO BE IT AT LEAST YOU WILL KNOW YOURSELF BETTER AND THAT IS MUCH MORE VALUABLE THAN ANY DIPLOMA OR RECOGNITION YOU COULD GET

TL R GET TO KNOW THYSELF PURE SCIENCE HAS TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL TO AFFECT HUMANITY ON A GLOBAL SCALE OTHER PROFESSIONS LIKE MEDICINE ARE MUCH MORE LOCAL YET CAN BE VERY REWARDING KNOW THYSELF AND BE HAPPIER
DEADLINES MOTIVATE ME MORE THAN LIVING CURVES
I READ THE BOOK LIFE ON PURPOSE IT REALLY HELPS I NEED A LOT OF MOTIVATION SO I WROTE MY PURPOSE ON A SLIP OF PAPER AND KEEP IT IN MY WORK ID IT REALLY HELPS BUMP OVER THE DAY TO DAY BS THE LARGER BS IS MORE OF A STRUGGLE

EDIT TO ADD

IN TERMS OF VALUES I READ THE BOOK LIFT BEING A POSITIVE INFLUENCE ONE THING YOU DO IN THAT BOOK IS WRITE DOWN THE VALUES THAT YOU HOLD OTHER PEOPLE TO THEN APPLY IT TO YOURSELF GUESS WHAT I WAS HOLDING OTHERS TO A HIGHER STANDARD THAN I WAS WILLING TO STAND UP TO SO I LOWERED MY STANDARDS FOR OTHERS A BIT AND UPPED MY OWN EXECUTION OF STANDARDS FOR MYSELF
DELETED
TWO MAIN REASONS IT'S FUN AND INTERESTING AND I AM SURROUNDED MOSTLY BY PEOPLE WHO ARE A LOT SMARTER THAN I AM AS OPPOSED TO ANY OTHER JOB I COULD DO WHERE I WOULD BE SURROUNDED EITHER LARGELY OR PRIMARILY BY MORONS

2 NONE REALLY EXCEPT THAT I THINK A JOB SHOULD AT LEAST SERVE SOME KIND OF PURPOSE WHICH BEING A RESEARCHER POTENTIALLY DOES AND IT MAKES BEING A RESEARCHER BETTER THAN MANY AN OFFICE JOB

I THINK BETTERING THE WORLD SIGNIFICANTLY IS TOO AMBITIOUS A GOAL AND WILL SET YOU UP FOR DISAPPOINTMENT NO MATTER YOUR CAREER CHOICE A MORE REALISTIC BUT STILL NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD GOAL WOULD BE TO NOT MAKE THE WORLD MUCH WORSE THAN IT IS STILL THERE IS OF COURSE THE POTENTIAL FOR YOUR RESEARCH TO HAVE SOME KIND OF APPLICATION IN INDUSTRY OR SOCIETY AT LARGE

ASKING THE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS I HONESTLY JUST FIGURED THEY WERE JUST TACKY GRAPHIC DESIGN INTENDED FOR CURTAINS CARPETS AND TEXTBOOKS ALIKE
I AM GUESSING IT IS MEANINGLESS I MEAN IT SHOWS UP ON HIS QUANTUM BOOK AND HIS FLUID MECHANICS BOOK AND SO ON YOU COULD PROBABLY ASCRIBE A MEANING TO IT BUT I SUSPECT YOU'D BE PROJECTING

AS AN ASIDE LANDAU AND LIFSHITZ REALLY ARE GODS OF PHYSICS AREN'T THEY
I JUST NOTICED THAT WHEN YOU PUT THEM SIDE BY SIDE LIKE THIS HETP THEN THE SMALLER CIRCLES SEEM TO FORM CHAINS HOLDING TWO BIGGER CIRCLES FROM DIFFERENT BOOKS TOGETHER

BUT AT THE END I THINK IT'S REALLY THE TACKY DESIGN ROUTE

I ALSO WANT TO MAKE EVERYONE STILL READING THIS AWARE OF THIS POST

R PHYSICS COMMENTS
SIMPLE ANSWER WE DON'T KNOW


TO ELABORATE STRING THEORY DOESN'T TELL YOU AT WHAT SCALE SUPERSYMMETRY SHOULD APPEAR AT THE NATURAL SCALE OF IT FROM STRING THEORY IS AROUND THE PLANCK SCALE OR PERHAPS THE GUT SCALE BOTH OF THESE ARE A LOT HIGHER THAN WHAT WE CAN REACH WITH PRESENT DAY EXPERIMENTS PEOPLE WANTED SUPERSYMMETRY TO BE AROUND THE ENERGIES THE LOC COULD REACH SINCE THEN IT WOULD SOLVE SOME OTHER THEORETICAL PUZZLES BUT THIS WAS NEVER TECHNICALLY NATURAL FROM A STRING THEORY PERSPECTIVE


SO WE DON'T KNOW DEPENDING ON YOUR MODEL IT CAN BE ANYWHERE FROM OUR CURRENT EXCLUSION LIMITS TO THE PLANCK SCALE PEOPLE COME UP WITH A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MODELS AND TRY TO ARGUE FOR WHY CERTAIN ONES ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS ETC BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS SORT OF MODEL BUILDING WILL NEVER TELL YOU ANYTHING YOU CAN TRUST WITHOUT THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA TO BACK IT UP
LIGHTEST SUPERSYMMETRIC PARTICLE
THANK YOU ALL FOR EDUCATED RESPONSES I'VE APPARENTLY HIT JUST ANOTHER WALL OF PHYSICS AND THANKS FOR LETTING ME KNOW THAT
TO CONTRAST WITH THE OTHERS WHO SO FAR HAVE ANSWERED AN UNEQUIVOCAL YES WIKIPEDIA IS CORRECT WHEN IT SS

THIS PRIMORDIAL SINGULARITY IS ITSELF SOMETIMES CALLED THE BIG BANG BUT THE TERM CAN ALSO REFER TO A MORE GENERIC EARLY HOT DENSE PHASE NOTES OF THE UNIVERSE

A PHYSICIST'S USE OF THE TERM BIG BANG DOES NOT NECESSARILY IMPLY A COMMITMENT TO A BELIEF IN AN INITIAL SINGULARITY JUST A COMMITMENT TO A PREVIOUS VERY HOT DENSE PHASE OF THE UNIVERSE
THAT'S PHD DISSERTATION YES
YES IT'S A SINGULARITY THERE IS A MATHEMATICAL THEORY OF SINGULARITIES ON THEY WOULD BE MANIFOLDS IF IT WASN'T FOR THE SINGULARITY WHICH I'M ONLY VAGUELY FAMILIAR WITH BUT I THINK THIS IS WHERE THE PENROSE THING COMES FROM HE PROPOSES THAT SPACETIME IS A MANIFOLD WITH SEVERAL SINGULARITIES AT REGULAR INTERVALS AND EACH ONE IS A BIG BANG
IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT AS ORIGINALLY CONCEIVED THE BIG BANG WAS A SINGULARITY BUT THEN MORE RESEARCH REVEALED THE CONCEPT OF INFLATION WHICH SORT OF DESTROYS OUR ABILITY TO INVESTIGATE A SINGULARITY THUS IN MODERN USAGE THE BIG BANG REPRESENTS THE SET OF INITIAL CONDITIONS OF THE UNIVERSE THAT EXISTS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE END OF INFLATION

SOURCE


EDIT I AM GETTING DOWNVOTED BUT WOULD BE INTERESTED IN HEARING THOUGHTS FROM OTHER PHYSICISTS ON MY EXPLANATION RATHER THAN JUST DOWNVOTES I WAS SURPRISED WHEN I FIRST READ ABOUT THIS ALTERNATIVE MEANING OF THE WORD TOO I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT REFERRED TO THE SINGULARITY BUT I DON'T THINK ALL PHYSICIST SEE IT THAT WAY FOR EXAMPLE THE BOOK BEYOND THE BIG BANG HAS A SIMILAR DISCUSSION STATING

THERE IS CONFUSION OVER WHICH MOMENT SHOULD BE CALLED THE BIG BANG SOME USE THE TERM TO REFER TO THE SINGULARITY OTHERS TAKE SOME MOMENT WHERE OUR EXPLANATIONS CONCERNING THE EARLY UNIVERSE BEGIN I AGREE THAT THE LATTER IS A BETTER USAGE AS ALAS COMMON USAGE IS NOT VERY EXACT AND A DEFINITION LIKE THIS ONE IS EASILY TRIPPED OVER I WILL AVOID THE TERM FOR MOST OF THE DISCUSSION

I AM UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THE OBSERVABLE UNIVERSE WAS CONTAINED IN A POINT OF ZERO VOLUME BUT THAT ALL NEIGHBORING VOLUMES OF SPACE WERE ALSO CONTAINED IN ADJACENT ZERO VOLUME POINTS SUCH THAT THE UNIVERSE WAS SPACIALLY INFINITE AT T WHILE ALSO BEING INFINITELY HOT AND DENSE
I SUGGEST NOT EVEN WRONG BY PETER COIT AS AN ANTIDOTE TO THE STRING THEORY
IN QUANTUM MECHANICS IS IT CORRECT TO SAY THAT GIVEN TWO OPERATORS A AND B ARE SUCH THAT A B I E THEY DON'T COMMUTE EACH OF THEIR MEASUREMENTS COLLAPSES THE HILBERT SPACE SPANNED BY THE WAVEFUNCTION INTO TWO SETS OF LINEARLY INDEPENDENT EIGENFUNCTION AS THEY DON'T COMMUTE THE EIGENFUNCTION THAT SPAN THE COLLAPSED STATE WHEN A IS MEASURED DO NOT SPAN THE COLLAPSED STATE WHEN B IS MEASURED AND VICE VERSA

ALSO DOES THIS IMPLY THAT IF TWO MEASUREMENTS COLLAPSE THE WAVEFUNCTION INTO A STATE WHERE THEY ARE SPANNED BY THE SAME EIGENFUNCTION THEN THE OPERATORS OF THE MEASUREMENTS COMMUTE AND WHAT IF THE STATES ONLY SHARE SAY JUST ONE COMMON EIGENFUNCTION

ALSO WHAT EXACTLY DOES HE MEAN WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT VALUES MEASUREMENTS BEING DETERMINISTIC IS THIS IN REGARD TO OF A VALUE OBTAINED FROM A COLLAPSED STATE AND OR DOES IT HAVE OTHER SIGNIFICANCE

AND DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO MAKE A MEASUREMENT THAT ISN'T AN EIGENVALUE I THINK NOT BECAUSE TO BE MEASURED A VALUE MUST SATISFY SOMETHING OF THE FORM AX X LIKE FOR ENERGY H ΕΨ BUT THEN DOES THE COLLAPSED STATE HAVE TO BE SPANNED BY LINEARLY INDEPENDENT EIGENFUNCTION

SORRY FOR ALL THESE QUESTIONS I'M NOT EVEN SURE IF THE QUESTIONS MAKE SENSE ARE RIDICULOUS I'M AN UNDERGRAD TRYING TO RECONCILE ALL THIS IN MY MIND HOWEVER UNFORTUNATELY MY LECTURERS SEEM MORE INTERESTED IN ME ACCEPTING STATEMENTS THAN ME REALLY GETTING A GOOD CORE UNDERSTANDING OF THE TOPIC
HOW DO YOU RECONCILE GENERAL RELATIVITY WITH THE CONCEPT OF A GRAVITON I THOUGHT THAT GENERAL RELATIVITY THEORIZES THAT GRAVITY IS PRODUCED BY MASS WARPING SPACETIME SUCH THAT IT IS NOT A FORCE AS NEWTON BELIEVED BUT RATHER A RESULT DUE TO MASSACHUSETTS I'M PUZZLED BECAUSE IF GENERAL RELATIVITY IS PRACTICALLY CONVENTION NOW WHY IS IT THAT WE STILL HAVE A NOTION OF A PARTICLE I EAST THE GRAVITON THAT MEDIATES GRAVITY ARE GRAVITONS AND GENERAL RELATIVITY AT ODDS
WHEN AN ELECTRICAL CURRENT PASSES THROUGH A LIQUID DOES IT GENERATE AN ELECTRIC FIELD INSIDE THE LIQUID ALONG WITH IT IF SO IS THERE ANY WAY TO KNOW WHAT THE ELECTRIC FIELD LINES FOR THAT FIELD LOOK LIKE

DO SPACE AND TIME AS DIMENSIONS EXIST SEPARATE FROM PARTICLES OF ANY KIND OR ARE THEY DEPENDENT ON THE PRESENCE OF SOMETHING ELSE
I'M READING ABOUT WEAK INTERACTION IN ORDER TO WRITE A REPORT ON IT BUT I'M HAVING TROUBLE FINDING USEFUL INFORMATION ON IT I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS
WHAT ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF WEAK INTERACTION AT WORK
2 HOW DO THE CHARGES OF THE BOSONS WHICH MEDIATE THE FORCE AFFECT THE INTERACTION
WHAT CAUSES A BOSON TO BE EMITTED FROM A PARTICLE
COULD I BE DIRECTED TO ANY SOURCES THAT EXPLAIN WEAK INTERACTION FOR EXTRA READING CITATIONS
ARE THERE ANY INTUITIONS ABOUT FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS WHICH ARE LESS ACCESSIBLE TO US BECAUSE WE USUALLY WORK IN BASE TEN I'VE HEARD THAT BASE TWO IS HANDY FOR COMPUTER APPLICATIONS BUT THAT PROBABLY DOESN'T COUNT SINCE COMPUTER TECH SEEMS OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS AND IF SO WHAT MIGHT ENABLE THOSE INTUITIONS BETTER THAN BASE TEN
HOW MANY INDEPENDENT COMPONENTS DOES A SYMMETRIC MATRIX HAVE

2 YOU'RE COUNTING DIMENSIONFUL CONSTANTS THESE ARE POINTLESS YOUR MATRIX IS DIMENSIONLESS OR IS A DIMENSIONFUL CONSTANT TIMES A DIMENSIONLESS MATRIX

THE NUMBER OF INDEPENDENT COMPONENTS OF THE MATRIX MUST NOT ACTUALLY NECESSARILY MATCH WITH THE NUMBER OF DIMENSIONLESS CONSTANTS THAT'S BECAUSE

NOT ALL SYMMETRIC MATRICES ARE NECESSARILY THE MATRIX FOR SOME BRICK ON A SPRING LINEAR MAP FROM PARAMETERS TO YOUR SPACE OF MATRICES IS NOT SURJECTIVE I CAN COUNT AT LEAST ONE OBVIOUS ADDITIONAL SYMMETRY YOUR MATRIX MUST HAVE

TWO BRICKS ON A SPRING COULD HAVE THE SAME MATRIX MAP IS NOT INJECTIVE
CAN YOU EXPLAIN IN MORE DETAIL WHAT YOU WANT TO ACCOMPLISH

IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU WANT TO DESCRIBE THE STATE OF THE SYSTEM AS A FOUR-DIMENSIONAL VECTOR V WITH EACH DIMENSION REFERRING TO THE POSITION ALONG EACH OF FOUR INDEPENDENT DIMENSIONS THEN YOU WANT TO DESCRIBE THE EVOLUTION OF THE SYSTEM BY AN EQUATION

D 2 V DT 2 MV

FOR SOME MATRIX M OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

IS THAT RIGHT IF SO YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS NOT LINEAR IF THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO CAN YOU EXPLAIN YOUR GOAL SOME MORE AND SAY WHY A MATRIX IS APPROPRIATE
THE PROBLEM WITH A QUESTION LIKE THIS IS THAT BECAUSE OF BASIC STRUCTURE A HOUSE WILL FALL DIFFERENTLY THAN SAY AN OFFICE BUILDING
WHEN ENGINEERS BUILD LARGE BUILDINGS AND USE GIRDERS AS THE MAIN SUPPORT THEY HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE PROPERTIES AND SHAPE OF THEIR GIRDER HOW RIGID ETC THEN FROM HERE YOU CAN GENERALLY CREATE A MASSIVE MATRIX A FEW OF THEM AS YOU'LL BE SOLVING MASSIVE SYSTEMS OF EQUATIONS WHOSE EIGENVALUES SHOULD BE PROPORTIONAL TO THE RESONANT FREQUENCY
I HAVE A LINK TO SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE SAYING
SORRY I COULDN'T FIND A SMALLER LINK
WELL I CAN'T IMAGINE THEY WOULD OSCILLATE DIFFERENTLY THAN THE TINE OF A TUNING FORK

THAT IS ASSUMING THE CONSTRUCTION OF EACH FLOOR IS IDENTICAL SOUNDS UNREASONABLE THE BOTTOM SHOULD BE MORE REINFORCED A BUILDING WILL WOBBLE BACK AND FORTH WITH THE AMOUNT OF FLEX DECREASING FROM A MAXIMUM VALUE AT THE BASE TO ZERO AT THE TOP THIS LEADS ME TO CONCLUDE THE GROUND FLOOR MIGHT BE A REASONABLE ANSWER

I THINK YOU NEED MORE INFORMATION TO GIVE ANY KIND OF ANALYTICAL ANSWER THOUGH
WHILE THE TOP FLOOR WILL MOVE THE FASTEST FLOORS AT VIBRATIONAL NODES WILL EXPERIENCE THE MOST STRESS AND WILL THEREFORE BREAK FIRST
EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING IS WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR

IT DEPENDS LETS SAY THAT ALL FLOORS HAVE EQUAL HEIGHT EQUAL MASS SAME STRUCTURAL SYSTEM AND MATERIAL USED ALSO THE OPENINGS ARE THE SAME TROUGH THE HEIGHT OF THE BUILDING BUILDING IS A SQUARE IN PLAN GROUND IS STIFF SO BUILDING IS FIXED TO IT NO NEED TO MODEL THE GROUND THERE IS NO CHANCE OF LIQUEFACTION CENTER OF MASS AND CENTER OF INERTIA ARE AT THE SAME POINT NO TORSIONAL EFFECTS


SO BASICALLY THE MAXIMUM TRANSVERSE FORCE AND BENDING MOMENTS ARE AT THE BOTTOM HENCE YOU CAN EXPECT TO COLLAPSE THERE


HOWEVER DUE TO DIFFERENT OSCILLATING EIGENVALUES THAT CAN DOMINATE AND THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF EARTHQUAKE SIGNAL IT CAN TURN OUT TO BE DIFFERENT
IN THE NORTHRIDGE QUAKE OF IT SEEMED TO USUALLY BE THE BOTTOM FLOOR MANY STORY APARTMENT BUILDINGS CONVERTED IN SECONDS TO 2 STORY BUILDINGS THERE WERE SOME TALLER BUILDINGS DAMAGED FROM RESONANCES
JUST A WILD GUESS BUT U MIGHT WANNA CALCULATE THE STRESS THAT'S AFFECTING THE BOTTOM FLOORS AS THEY CAN COLLAPSE DUE TO THAT ASWELL SORRY FOR ANY TECHNICAL MISTAKES OR JUST WORDS BEING USED WRONGLY
UM DESIGNING AN EARTHQUAKE FINGERS TRIED TO TYPE EARTHQUARK SAFE BUILDING BY ASKING ON REDDIN THIS IS WORRISOME

IT'S HARD TO SAY WHAT CONSTITUTES THE GREAT UNSOLVED QUESTIONS BUT ANY ONE OF THOSE SUBJECT HEADINGS INDICATES SOMETHING THAT AT LEAST A FEW DOZEN AND UP TO ORDER A THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING ON

PROBABLY THE TRENDIEST THING RIGHT NOW IS TOPOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION OF MATTER TOPOLOGICAL INSULATORS AND SUPERCONDUCTORS HAVE REALLY TAKEN OFF WITH MUCH MORE EXPERIMENTAL PROGRESS IN THE FORMER THAN THE LATTER A SLIGHTLY YOUNGER TREND IS TOPOLOGICAL SEMIMETAL BUT WHILE THE INSULATORS AND SUPERCONDUCTORS MAY END UP BEING REALISTICALLY USEFUL I THINK THIS ONE'S GOING TO HAVE BEEN A FAD YOU CAN TAKE TONS OF GORGEOUS APES PICTURES OF TOPOLOGICAL SEMIMETAL BUT FOR APPLIED PURPOSES THEY'RE JUST UM METALS

I PERSONALLY THINK THOUGH THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR MY OWN WEE NOT BIO SOFT MATTER SUBSET OF THE FIELD IS THE SAME THING IT'S ALWAYS BEEN SOLVING THE QUANTUM PROBLEM OF COURSE THIS WILL NEVER ACTUALLY BE SOLVED BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN PROGRESS HASN'T BEEN MADE AND NEW AND BETTER TOOLS DEVELOPED WITH A LOT OF ACTIVITY COMING FROM A NEXUS BETWEEN CONDENSED MATTER CHEMISTRY AND QUANTUM INFORMATION
EXPERIMENTALLY 2D SYSTEMS LIKE GRAPHEME ARE GETTING A LOT OF ATTENTION ALSO EVEN MICROSOFT HAS TAKEN INTEREST IN THE DISCOVERY POTENTIAL USES OF TOPOLOGICAL STATES OF MATTER

THEORETICALLY I THINK FINDING ADS AFT CORRESPONDENCE IN CONDENSED MATTER SYSTEMS IS A FRUITFUL TOPIC THAT CONTINUES GETTING A LOT OF ATTENTION
CUPRATE UNSOLVED BUT I'VE BEEN TOLD FUNDING HAS SHIFTED AWAY FROM IT
2D MATERIALS GRAPHEME MDC MONOLAYER ETC
COMPUTATIONAL QUANTUM PHYSICS DAFT GW ETC
TOPOLOGICAL MATERIALS
BIG UNSOLVED QUESTIONS

IS THERE ANY REAL USE FOR TOPOLOGICAL INSULATORS APART FROM PAPER PUBLISHING
IS THERE ANY REAL USE FOR WEYL SEMIMETAL APART FROM PAPER PUBLISHING
IS THERE ANY REAL POINT TO THE FANCY PROPERTIES OF GRAPHEME THAT THEORISTS LOVE OR IS IT JUST GOING TO BE USEFUL AS A TRANSPARENT CONDUCTOR

AND THERE'S ALSO I GUESS WHICH IS NOT SO MUCH AN UNSOLVED PROBLEM AS AN UNDAMPED STANDING WAVE OF ARGUMENT

I DO SIMULATIONS THE HOT TECHNIQUES I SEE NOW ARE PARALLEL REPLICA MOLECULAR DYNAMICS AND GW BSE FOR ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE WE ARE ALSO SEEING COUPLED PLASMON PHONON AND ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE CALCULATIONS FOR EXACT PHOTONIC PROPERTIES CALCULATIONS IF YOU ARE A THEORIST YOU MIGHT ENJOY WORKING ON BETTER ALGORITHMS FOR THE PARTS OF THESE SIMULATIONS THAT SCALE POORLY FOR EXAMPLE A NAIVE COULOMB SUM BETWEEN IONS TAKES O N 2 BUT IF YOU USE EFTS YOU CAN GET THAT TO O N LOG N AND THE FAST MULTIPOLE METHOD CAN DO IT IN O N
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS MY GROUPS IS LOOKING AT AT THE MOMENT IS HEAT CONDUCTIVITY AT INTERFACES ONE OF THE MAJOR ROADBLOCKS IN COMPUTING IS THE PROBLEM OF DISSIPATING HEAT AWAY FROM YOUR PROCESSOR YOU COULD OVERCLOAK THE CRAP OUT OF YOUR PROCESSOR IF YOU COULD JUST GET THE THING TO COOL DOWN SO ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS TO CREATE A THERMAL INTERFACE BETWEEN THE PROCESSOR AND YOUR HEAT SINK WITH A REALLY HIGH THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY THIS IS WHY YOU PUT THAT THERMALLY CONDUCTIVE PASTE ONTO THE BACK SIDE OF YOUR PROCESSOR


UNFORTUNATELY THE MATERIALS WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT FOR THESE THERMAL COMPOUNDS SUCK YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF PASTES AND GREASES THAT ARE REASONABLY DEFORMABLE HAVE GOOD FLOW PROPERTIES AT MODERATE LOADS BUT WHOSE THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY SUCKS THEN YOU HAVE HIGH THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY MATERIALS THAT WONT CONFORM TO THE INTERFACE THE COMMON SOLUTION IS TO DO SOMETHING LIKE ADD DIAMOND GRIT OR COLLOIDAL SILVER TO A PASTE BUT THIS GREATLY REDUCES THE FLOW PROPERTIES AND LEAVES TO AIR GAPS DUE TO THE TWO SURFACES BEING ROUGH ON THE MICRO NANOSCALE AND AIR REALLY SUCKS AS A THERMAL CONDUCTOR


SO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK GOING INTO NEW GEOMETRIES AND MATERIALS THAT CAN GET AROUND THIS PROBLEM
I ASSUME YOU HAVE CHECKED OUT THE OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION

I'LL ADMIT I HAVE NEVER USED THE PYTHON VERSION OF IT BUT IT LOOKS A HELL OF A LOT NICER THAN THE C
THE BEST WAY TO LEARN BEANT IS BY DOING THERE ARE A LOT OF EXAMPLES AVAILABLE WITH THE INSTALLATION GO THROUGH THOSE AND PICK OUT ELEMENTS THAT YOU WANT TO USE

I DON'T KNOW HOW THE INTERFACE WITH BEANT AND PYTHON WORKS BUT I'D RECOMMEND GAINING SOME PROFICIENCY WITH C OR AT LEAST PROGRAMMING
YOU CAN USE NEURAL NETWORKS FOR ANY KIND OF HYPOTHESIS TESTAMENT FOR EXAMPLE YOU COULD TAKE DATA FROM SOME SIMPLE EXPERIMENT AND USE A NEURAL NETWORK TO TEST SOME HYPOTHESIS ABOUT YOUR DATA
A CLASSICAL NEURAL NETWORK APPLICATION IN ASTRONOMY IS GALAXY PHOTOMETRIC REDSHIFT THE IDEA HERE IS IT'S QUITE OBSERVATIONALLY EXPENSIVE TO GET DISTANCES TO ALL GALAXIES IN A SURVEY FROM SPECTROSCOPIC REDSHIFT SO NEURAL NETWORKS ARE USED TO PROVIDE PHOTOMETRIC REDSHIFT FROM BROAD BAND IMAGES THE NETWORK IS TRAINED ON SOME SUBSET OF DATA WITH SPECTROSCOPIC REDSHIFT AND THEN APPLIED TO A WHOLE SURVEY
LAB REPORTS BASICALLY JUST LAB REPORTS

HAVE TO HAND IN 2 THIS FRIDAY BOTH BASICALLY DONE

FIRST ONE IS ABOUT PHOTOEMISSION SPECTROSCOPY AND ELECTRON DIFFRACTION AND WE MIGHT HAVE TO ADD ONE OR TWO MORE SENTENCES EXPLAINING SOME OF THE IMAGES WE SAW

SECOND ONE IS ABOUT MEASURING THE LIFETIME IF MUONS TROUBLE HERE IS THAT WE HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHY THE ONE OF THE METHODS WE ARE SUPPOSED TO USE DOESNT GIVE A PROPER RESULT SECONDS

BECAUSE IT SIMPLY DOESNT WORK FOR THE EFFECTIVE DATA WE HAVE

WE ALSO HAD HAVE TO REWORK OUR REPORT ABOUT THE EXPERIMENT A BIT IDENTIFY THE LEAD X-RAY PEAK

AND OUR SUPERVISOR FOR THE EXPERIMENT WANTS SOMETHING DONE A BIT DIFFERENTLY THAN WHAT THE INSTRUCTIONS SAY WHICH SHE TOLD US AFTER WE HANDED IN THE REPORT

EDIT GREAT NOW IM PISSED I DID WHAT SHE WANTED US TO AND THE VALUE I GET MAKES SENSE I GET WHEN I SHOULD GET WHILE WITH THE OLD METHODE THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE WAS THAT I SHOULD GET AND GOT 2 THE BEST OLD VALUE WAS 2 VS

AND TO TOP THINGS OFF WE WILL HAVE TO DO TWO EXPERIMENTS THIS WEEK TRANSVERSAL VIBRATING SAMPLE MAGNETOMETER AND OPTICAL EMISSION AND ABSORPTION SPECTRUMS BECAUSE THE SUPERVISOR FOR THE FIRST ONE APPARENTLY DOESNT HAVE TIME AT THE DATE THAT WE BOOKED THAT ONE FOR

I ALSO STILL HAVE LECTURES ON HEMODYNAMICS AND SPASTICS AND PARTICLE PHYSICS

IN THE LAST ONE WE ARE CURRENTLY DISCUSSING BASICS STUFF ABOUT THE STANDARDMODELL FEYNMAN DIAGRAMS HOW TO CALCULATE SOME CROSS-SECTION AND WE JUST STARTED TALKING ABOUT CD BASICALLY NO MATH JUST EFFECTS
HANDED IN MY BACHELOR THESIS GOT BACK THE INFORMAL CORRECTION BY MY PROFESSOR GONNA FIX THE SMALL ISSUES AND FORMALLY SEND IT TO THE EXAM OFFICE END OF THE WEEK
I AM SETTING UP AND PACKING OUR DEMO PORTABLE HALL THRUSTER SYSTEM FOR SOME PUBLIC OUTREACH PRESENTATIONS I LIKE THIS KIND OF THINGS BUT IT JUST TAKES SO MUCH TIME
TRYING TO DESIGN A REFERENCE WHISTLE NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU BLOW IT WILL ALWAYS BE THE SAME VOLUME AND THE SAME PITCH

HARDER THAN IT SEEMS
YOU ARE IDEALIZING SCIENCE TOO MUCH YOU DID AN UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE WHICH IS A BAD PROXY FOR ACADEMIC LIFE AND STILL YOU ARE SURE THAT BEING A QUANTUM GRAVITY RESEARCHER WOULD HAVE BEEN IDEAL AND YOUR MOST MEANINGFUL GOAL

LIFE IS MUCH MORE THAN ACADEMIA AND RESEARCHERS PROFESSORS SHOULD STOP SPREADING THIS LIE THAT THE ONLY MEANINGFUL GOAL OF A PHYSICIST SHOULD BE TO BECOME A TENURED PROFESSOR ACADEMIC LIFE IS BRUTAL STRESSFUL BADLY SUITED FOR FAMILY LIFE AND FOR LIFE IN GENERAL I COMPLETED A PHD AND A POSTHOC AND I WAS JUST SO TIRED TO HAVE MY ADVISOR CALL ME LAZY ALL THE TIME BECAUSE I DIDN'T WORK HOURS A DAYS DAYS A WEEK SIC

YOU DODGED A BULLET MY FRIEND I NOW WORK AS A DATA SCIENTIST AND I'M SUPER SATISFIED WITH MY HOURS WEEK YOU WILL BE MORE AT EASE AND MORE HELPFUL TO YOUR FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS OUTSIDE OF ACADEMIA NOT TO MENTION TO YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS
I'VE BEEN THERE THERE'S TWO ANGLES TO TACKLE HERE

STOP PUTTING DOWN YOUR OWN LIFE GETTING MARRIED STARTING A FAMILY IF YOU ARE AND GETTING A DECENT JOB AIN'T NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF AND IT ISN'T EASY YOU NEED TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY OR IT WON'T WORK IF YOU DON'T ENJOY YOUR JOB WELL CONGRATS YOU HAVE A NEW MEANINGFUL JOB OF GETTING ONE THAT YOU WILL ENJOY PUT YOUR ENERGY INTO THAT

2 DON'T IDEALIZE A CAREER IN PHYSICS FROM YOUR POST IT'S NOT CLEAR YOU REALLY HAVE CONSIDERED IT BUT ACADEMIC LIFE PARTICULARLY THEORETICAL PHYSICS IS BRUTAL EVEN IF YOU GET THROUGH A TOP PHD PROGRAM YOU'RE STILL LOOKING AT MULTIPLE EACH OF WHICH YOU MIGHT VERY WELL NOT GET BEFORE YOUR FIRST ADJUNCT THERE'S A LOT OF VERY SMART PEOPLE THAT COULD HAVE HAD YOUR SPOT AT ANY STEP ALONG THE WAY AND YOU WILL HAVE TO PROVE YOU DESERVE IT AT EVERY TURN YOU WILL HAVE TO MOVE EVERY COUPLE YEARS AND YOUR SIGNIFICANT OTHER WILL HAVE TO FIND A NEW JOB EVERY TIME YOU WON'T MAKE WHAT YOU WILL STARTING IN A TECH JOB UNTIL YOU GET YOUR FIRST FULL PROFESSORSHIP AND EVEN THEN THE HOURS WILL BE TERRIBLE AT THIS STAGE SAYING A CAREER AS A QUANTUM GRAVITY RESEARCHER WOULD HAVE BEEN IDEAL FOR ME IS LIKE A HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE SAYING A CAREER AS A PRO WOULD BE IDEAL FOR ME MINUS THE PAY AND FAME AT THE END LIKE YOU'RE NOT WRONG BUT THERE'S A LOT OF MIDDLE STUFF YOU'RE IGNORING THERE
HOW CAN I LIVE MY LIFE KNOWING I'LL NEVER ACHIEVE MY MOST MEANINGFUL GOAL

ARE YOU DEAD YET NO THEN STOP BEING MELODRAMATIC FIND OUT WHY YOU HAVE BEEN REJECTED AND THEN CORRECT THE DEFICIENCY OR MOVE ON TO SOMETHING ELSE AND APPLY MEANING

IF YOU LIKE MATH HEAVY FIELDS WITH OBSCURE QUESTIONS AND NO EASILY DISCERNIBLE RIGHT ANSWERS TRY AN ECONOMICS PHD INSTEAD
THIS SUB IS REALLY SCARY FOR AN UNDERGRAD SUCH AS MYSELF WHO THINKS HE WANTS TO BE A PHYSICIST LITERALLY EVERYONE IS JUST SAYING HOW IT SUCKS AND THAT YOU HAVE TO DEDICATE YOUR LIFE TO IT WHICH IS MY BIGGEST FEAR I WANT TO STUDY NATURE BUT I ALSO WANT TO HAVE A LIFE AND FREE TIME AM I ASKING FOR TOO MUCH
THERE'S ALWAYS SOFTWARE ENGINEER
FAILED TO COMPLETE MY PHYSICS MSC A LONG TIME AGO MOSTLY DUE TO MEDICAL ISSUES MY CHOSEN FIELD BACK THEN WAS INTEGRATED OPTICS INSTEAD LIKE YOU MY FIRST JOB WAS IN A CALL CENTER PERFORMED QUITE WELL THERE AND AFTER LESS THAN A YEAR I RAN MY OWN CUSTOMER PROJECT BECAME THE SECOND IT GUY AND THEY OFFERED ME A PERMANENT POSITION DID THAT FOR YEARS WAS A FAIRLY GOOD JOB BUT QUITE UNDERPAID DUE TO MY LACK OF PAPERWORK

THEN MY STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT BEGAN WHICH WAS A WAKE-UP CALL TO LOOK FOR A BETTER JOB I ENDED UP AT THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR SUPERCOMPUTING WHERE I DID UNIX AND LATER LINUX ADMIN WHICH GREW INTO CONSULTANCY AND DESIGN WORK AND A PROMOTION ABOUT EVERY 2 YEARS LEFT THAT JOB BECAUSE OF A CHANGE OF MANAGEMENT

YEARS AFTER FLUNKING PHYSICS I ENDED UP IN MY DREAM JOB SUPPORTING RADIO ASTRONOMY I STARTED OUT AS A NETWORK ADMIN SOON BECAME RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING ALL THE NETWORK LINUX NETWORK STUFF GOT INVOLVED IN R D PROJECTS BECAUSE OF THAT GOT TO RUN MY OWN WORKPACKAGE ON ONE OF THOSE AND JUST RECENTLY I'M DOING SOME ACTUAL APPLIED PHYSICS ASTRONOMY RESEARCH AND AM INVOLVED IN THE DESIGN OF NEW ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS I'M HAVING AN ABSOLUTE BLAST I'M ON A SMALL NUMBER OF PAPERS AND A DECADE AFTER JOINING THIS INSTITUTE THERE'S SERIOUS TALK ABOUT TURNING MY RESEARCH INTO A PHD PROJECT AND THEN THESIS

I QUITE UNDERSTAND YOUR FEELINGS I WAS ALSO VERY DISAPPOINTED TO NOT GET ON THE EXPRESS TRAIN TO PHD POSTHOC PROFESSORSHIP AND OF COURSE NOBEL PRICE HAVING HAD A NEARLY COMPLETE ACADEMIC EDUCATION DID GIVE ME A PRETTY BIG EDGE IN THE JOBS AFTERWARDS CRITICAL THINKING AND THE ABILITY TO QUICKLY PICK UP NEW SUBJECTS

YOU ASKED FOR ADVICE AND ALTHOUGH YOUR SITUATION IS OF COURSE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM MINE HERE'S A FEW THINGS THAT I THINK MIGHT HELP

KEEP UP THE SELF-STUDY I GOT INTO UNIX ADMIN AT A FAIRLY PRESTIGIOUS EMPLOYER DESPITE HAVING NO TRAINING OR PREVIOUS JOB EXPERIENCE BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE I HAD BEEN USING UNIX SYSTEMS PERSONALLY FOR YEARS ALREADY I KEPT STUDYING AND LEARNING NOT IMMEDIATELY AS A WAY TO ADVANCE MY CAREER BUT SIMPLY TO SATISFY MY CURIOSITY IMPROVE THINGS AT WORK AND HAVE FUN ON MY CURRENT JOB I JUT COULDN'T STOP MYSELF LEARNING ABOUT THE INSTRUMENTS METHODS OBSERVATIONS WE WERE DOING

THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST TIME EVER IN HISTORY FOR SELF-STUDY THANKS TO OPEN ACCESS JOURNALS ONLINE ACADEMIC COURSES BLOGS AND MORE SCIENCE NEWS COMING OUT EVERY DAY THAN ONE COULD POSSIBLY KEEP UP WITH

MY EMPLOYER IS ACTUALLY VERY SUPPORTIVE OF PEOPLE STUDYING TO IMPROVE THEMSELVES THIS IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING TO LOOK FOR WHEN YOU GROW OUT OF THE BUSINESS FIND SOMETHING AT THE MORE APPLIED SIDE OF SCIENCE WHERE THERE IS MORE ROOM TO CONTRIBUTE AS A

BE REPLACEABLE IF YOU'RE GOOD AT SOMETHING IT IS NATURAL TO WANT TO HOLD ON TO THAT AND TO BECOME IRREPLACEABLE FOR THAT PART OF THE PROCESS INSTEAD MY ADVICE WOULD BE TO DOCUMENT PROPOSE PROCEDURES TRAIN OTHERS IF YOU'RE PERFORMING POORLY BEING IRREPLACEABLE MIGHT BE DESIRABLE BUT IF YOU'RE DOING WELL IT ONLY DRAGS YOU DOWN THERE'S OFTEN MUCH MORE VALUABLE WORK THAT AN EMPLOYER SIMPLY ISN'T FINDING THE PEOPLE FOR SO BE AVAILABLE FOR THAT CASE IN POINT I WAS DOING SO MUCH R D WORK THAT I COULDN'T ALSO KEEP UP WITH MY STANDARD UNIX NETWORK ADMIN DUTIES SO INITIALLY THEY WANTED TO TAKE ME OFF THOSE PROJECTS I SUCCESSFULLY ARGUED THAT FINDING SOMEONE WITH MY SKILL SET AT SHORT NOTICE WOULD BE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE AND SUGGESTED THAT WE'D TAKE ON A NEW LINUX ADMIN ON INSTEAD WHICH THEY DID AND IT WORKED OUT VERY WELL BECAUSE EVERYTHING I HAD BUILT UP IN THE YEARS PRIOR AS THE LONELY SYSADMIN WAS ACTUALLY DOCUMENTED STANDARDIZED AND MUCH SIMPLIFIED FROM WHEN I CAME IN

AS OTHERS HAVE SAID DON'T IDEALIZE THE PHYSICS CAREER PATH TOO MUCH WE OFFER POSTHOC POSITIONS AT MY PLACE AND THEY ALL STRUGGLE WITH HOW HARD IT IS TO MAINTAIN A RELATIONSHIP PUBLICATION PRESSURE AND THE NEAR IMPOSSIBILITY OF LANDING A PERMANENT POSITION IT'S HARSH AND IT REALLY MAKES ME SAD TO SEE THEM LEAVE AGAIN AFTER A FEW YEARS TO YET ANOTHER POSTHOC OR DROPPING OUT I KIND OF LIKE MY JOB SECURITY AND THE ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE ON A MUCH LONGER TIMESCALE

FINALLY IT DOES TAKE PUTTING YOUR LOVE FOR SCIENCE AND RESEARCH ABOVE OTHER THINGS I COULD HAVE STAYED IN IT AND MADE MUCH MORE MONEY THE LAST TIME I WAS LOOKING FOR A JOB I ENDED UP WITH COMPLETED OFFERS IN HAND ONE OF THEM A REALLY WELL PAID JOB IN UNIX SUPPORT AND AT THE OTHER HAND A VERY MODEST SALARY INCREASE AND MOVING TO THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE TO GET CLOSER TO SCIENCE SO I PACKED UP AND MOVED AND HAVEN'T REGRETTED THAT CHOICE AT ALL BUT THAT MIGHT BE A HARDER DECISION FOR YOU WITH A FAMILY DEPENDING ON YOU

YOU CAN'T SETTLE DOWN AND PURSUE A CAREER AS A RESEARCHER YOU WILL HAVE TO MOVE A LOT

YOU'RE ALREADY AT A MAJOR DISADVANTAGE COMPARED TO OTHERS MY ADVICE GET A MASTER'S AND GO WORK IN INDUSTRY
I DID ABOUT TWO YEARS OF UNDERGRAD WORK ON A PHYSICS DEGREE LOVED THE TIME I SPENT WORKING ON MY MAJOR IT WAS A BAD TIME TO BE STUDYING IN DETROIT THOUGH AND WITHOUT A JOB I COULDN'T COPE WITH THE HUGE DEBT I WAS TAKING ON TO HOPEFULLY GET INTO A VERY SMALL FIELD SO I DROPPED OUT GOT BACK INTO AN INDUSTRIAL JOB AND EVENTUALLY FOUND MYSELF HERE IN A COZY HOUSE WITH A PRETTY CUSHY JOB BUILDING CNC MACHINES CURRENTLY THERE'S THREE BOOKS ON PROGRAMMING ONE ON GAME THEORY AND TWO ON PHYSICS SITTING ON MY TABLE MY MIND DEFINITELY CRAVES THAT CHALLENGE FROM TIME TO TIME AND I BRUSH UP YEARLY AND ALWAYS FOLLOW ANY REAL NEWS FROM THE FIELD THANKFULLY MY CURRENT LINE OF WORK ISN'T COMPLETELY MIND NUMBING EITHER IN THE LONG RUN I'LL GET BACK TO SCHOOL BUT IT'LL HAVE TO BE ONCE MY SON IS A BIT OLDER
IN A WORD TEACH YOU DON'T NEED TO WORK AS A TEACHER JUST TEACH PHYSICS AS AN UNDERGRAD I CAN'T SAY MUCH TO NOT SUCCEEDING AS A PHYSICIST BUT I KNOW WITHOUT A DOUBT THAT TEACHING IS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO STAY CONNECTED WITH PHYSICS AND IT'S INCREDIBLY REWARDING THROUGH TEACHING I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH MORE ABOUT PHYSICS THAN I EVER WOULD AS A STUDENT IT'S NOT PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES OF SCIENCE BUT IF YOU GOT INTO PHYSICS BECAUSE YOU LOVE TO LEARN I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU TEACH IN SOME SETTING IF YOU ARE STILL LOOKING INTO GRAD SCHOOL THERE ARE MANY POSSIBLE ALBEIT LESS CONVENTIONAL WAYS TO GET IN WORKING AT NATIONAL LABS OR IN INDUSTRY CAN PROVIDE VALUABLE RESEARCH EXPERIENCE THAT PHD PROGRAMS LOOK FOR

EDIT I KNOW THAT I DIDN'T ANSWER YOUR QUESTION BUT I HOPE THAT IT HELPS
I THINK MY CONCEPTION OF MY MOST MEANINGFUL GOAL HAS CHANGED THROUGH TIME IN MY THIRTIES I DON'T THINK OF MYSELF AS A FAILURE BECAUSE I DIDN'T COMPLETE ALL MY GOALS IN MY TWENTIES AND I'M SURE MY FORTIES WILL BE THE SAME FOR WHAT I THINK I WANT NOW

I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON WHAT IT IS YOU WANT ED FROM A CAREER AS A QUANTUM GRAVITY RESEARCHER WAS IT THE KNOWLEDGE YOU WERE ADVANCING UNDERSTANDING OF SCIENCE A HIGH SCHOOL PHYSICS TEACHER CAN MAKE THAT CLAIM TOO FOR EXAMPLE

WAS IT THE PROCESS OF DOING RESEARCH THAT PROCESS CAN BE EXTRAPOLATED OUT TOO

WAS IT THAT YOU HAD INVESTED TOO MUCH OF YOUR IDENTITY IN WHAT YOU HOPED YOUR CAREER WOULD BE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ANSWER THAT ONE BUT YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED IT'S NOT UNLIKELY YOU'LL HAVE KIDS THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE PRETTY GOOD IN REFOCUSING YOUR CONCEPTIONS OF WHAT IT MEANS TO FIND SUCCESS AND FULFILLMENT I'VE SEEN
IF THIS LEVEL OF STRUGGLE AND NOT ACHIEVING YOUR GOALS LEADS TO SUCH FEELINGS OF FAILURE AND GIVING UP THEORETICAL PHYSICS IS PROBABLY NOT FOR YOU WHAT YOU'VE FELT SO FAR IS NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT'S TO COME

ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU WORK THROUGH THESE CHALLENGES YOU MAY LEARN AND GROW TO HANDLE THOSE LATER CHALLENGES

EVEN EINSTEIN HAD TO TAKE A JOB AS A PATENT CLERK IN SWITZERLAND BEFORE BOUNCING BACK
WHILE I WAS WORKING IN A KITCHEN TO PUT MYSELF THROUGH UNDERGRAD THE HEAD CHEF TOLD ME SOMETHING I OFTEN HAVE TELL MYSELF

YOU WORK TO LIVE YOU DON'T LIVE TO WORK

AFTER COLLEGE I STARTED WORKING IN PRODUCTION AT A SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY AND VERY SHORTLY AFTERWARD I WAS OFFERED AN ENTRY LEVEL ENGINEERING POSITION BASED ON MY PERFORMANCE AND EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND MECHANICAL ENGINEERING WAS MY CHOSEN CAREER PATH I WAS BEYOND STOKED

ONE MONTH LATER DURING MY TRAINING I WAS LAID OFF BECAUSE THE COMPANY WAS BEING DOWNSIZED I WAS HOPEFUL THAT I COULD FIND A SIMILAR OPPORTUNITY BUT THE JOB MARKET WAS TERRIBLE AND I HAD TO TAKE A CALL CENTER JOB JUST TO MAKE ENDS MEET I GRADUATED FROM THE CALL CENTER INTO EXTERNAL TECH SUPPORT AND THEN TO IT WORK I'M CURRENTLY TRAINING TO BECOME A SYSTEMS ADMINISTRATOR WHICH IS MY CAREER GOAL ADJUSTED FOR THE CAPRICIOUS NATURE OF LIFE

AM I BITTER AF ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY I LOST ABSOLUTELY HOWEVER I HAVE A JOB I DON'T HATE AND IT PAYS THE BILLS WITH A LITTLE LEFT OVER EACH MONTH AND THAT'S ABOUT WHAT ANY PERSON HAS THE RIGHT TO EXPECT OUT OF LIFE I HAVE TO REMIND MYSELF FROM TIME TO TIME THAT I AM NOT DEFINED BY MY CAREER AND MY LIFE OUTSIDE OF WORK IS WHAT REALLY MATTERS
I FEEL EXACTLY THE SAME I'M NOW TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL AND WORKING ON MASTERING QUANTUM E M GR PHYSICS IN MY SPARE TIME THE LITTLE I HAVE EVENTUALLY I'LL GET THERE I STILL HAVEN'T GIVEN UP

EACH YEAH I STUDY FOR AND TAKE THE PHYSICS GRE WITH NOTABLE IMPROVEMENT MY ESTIMATE IS WITHIN YEARS I'LL BE TEACHING PHYSICS AT A UNIVERSITY AND FINALLY HAVE A CHANCE AT DOING REAL RESEARCH TOO

KEEP PUSHING AND DON'T GIVE UP
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE MADE IT AS A QUANTUM GRAVITY RESEARCHER THERE'S LIKE ONE PROFESSOR POSITION THAT OPENS UP EVERY FOUR YEARS AND IT'S TAKEN BY WHOEVER THE BIGGEST PRODIGY IN FIELD IS UNLESS YOU'RE A SAVANT WITH SUPER HUMAN MATHEMATICAL SKILLS YOU WOULDN'T MAKE IT I WAS DOING MY PHD IN Q I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT DID THEIR PHD IN Q AKA I KNOW A LOT OF INSTRUCTORS AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERS
DON'T WORRY QUANTUM GRAVITY IS JUST REALLY SMALL GRAVITY AND GRAVITY IS JUST THE FEELING YOU GET WHEN YOU FALL OFF OF A TALL BUILDING SO UNLESS YOU LIKE FALLING OFF OF BUILDINGS YOU SHOULD BE GLAD THAT THE FEELING IS QUANTUMLY SMALL OR YOU'D BE REALLY SCARED ALL THE TIME HOWEVER IF THE FEELING IS WHAT YOU ARE CHASING YOU SHOULD JUST TAKE UP SKYDIVING IT'S THE SAME AS HAVING A WHOLE BUNCH OF QUANTUM GRAVITIES BUT ALL AT THE SAME TIME SO REALLY SCARY OR I GUESS GHOST HUNTING WOULD ALSO BE JUST AS GOOD
RESPONSIBILITY IS COOL BUT THERE'S MORE THINGS IN LIFE


LIKE GETTING YOUR DICK RODE ALL FUCKING NIGHT
I GOT A DOUBLE MAJOR IN MATH AND PHYSICS HOPING TO GO TO A PHD PROGRAM IN SOME SORT OF NUCLEAR PHYSICS DURING MY UNDERGRAD I INTERNED AT A NATIONAL LAB BUT GOT STUCK DOING ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING PROJECTS AT THE TIME I WAS PRETTY BUMMED OUT BUT I ENDED UP WORKING ON SOME COOL SHIT AND PEOPLE STARTED TO TAKE NOTICE OF MY WORK

FAST FORWARD TO TODAY I'M A WIRELESS ENGINEER FOCUSING ON CONSUMER TECHNOLOGIES BLUETOOTH HIGBEE NFC ETC I DID END UP GETTING ACCEPTED INTO A GRAD PROGRAM AFTER MY BS BUT FOR INFORMATION ENGINEERING I WEIGHED THE COST BENEFIT AND REALIZED I COULD DIVE INTO INDUSTRY LEARN JUST AS MUCH ABOUT WIRELESS TECH AND GET PAID MORE AND RIGHT AWAY

I MAKE GOOD MONEY IN THE SILICON VALLEY I HAVE A FAST PACED JOB WORKING ON CUTTING EDGE TECH BUT I STILL FEEL PRETTY EMPTY NOT WORKING TO BECOME OR AS A PHYSICIST SOMETIMES I READ RESEARCH ARTICLES AND SOLVE OLD QUANTUM MECHANICS PROBLEMS FROM MY OLD NOTES JUST TO FEEL IN THE GAME LOOKING BACK I'D TRADE THE FREEDOM THE RELATIONSHIPS AND MONEY TO WORK IN PHYSICS RESEARCH WHAT I DO NOW SEEMS SO TERRESTRIAL AND UNIMPORTANT I'M EVEN WORRIED I'LL BECOME A COMPLETE RAT IN THE RACE AND FORGET THE BIG PICTURE THAT IS THE STUDY OF THE UNIVERSE
I TRULY LOVE PHYSICS AND KNOW A CAREER AS A QUANTUM GRAVITY RESEARCHER WOULD HAVE BEEN IDEAL FOR ME

I THINK YOU'RE FOCUSING TOO MUCH ON SUPERFICIAL ASPECTS OF WORK YOU DECIDED WHAT YOU WANT YOUR JOB TITLE TO BE INSTEAD OF FIGURING OUT WHAT YOU WANT TO ACTUALLY BE DOING

WHAT KIND OF PROBLEM SOLVING DO YOU WANT TO BE DOING WHAT DO YOU WANT YOUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH YOUR COWORKERS TO LOOK LIKE HOW DO YOU WANT YOUR JOB PERFORMANCE TO BE EVALUATED FIGURE OUT YOUR IDEAL WORK ENVIRONMENT AND THEN LOOK FOR JOBS THAT MATCH IT YOU WILL END UP MORE SATISFIED THAT WAY THAN IF YOU FOCUS ON ONE SINGLE JOB WHICH FRANKLY I SUSPECT YOU CHOSE MORE FOR THE PRESTIGE OF BEING A QUANTUM GRAVITY RESEARCHER THAN FOR THE WORK ITSELF ESPECIALLY IF THIS IS A DECISION YOU MADE WHILE READING POP SCIENCE BOOKS IN HIGH SCHOOL
I WENT ALL THE WAY AND GOT A PHD IN PHYSICS FROM HARVARD BUT AT THE TIME I GRADUATED THERE WERE ACADEMIC JOBS FOR ONLY IN PHS SO MOST NEEDED TO FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO DO LOTS OF MY CLASS WENT ON TO DO MANAGEMENT CONSULTING NOT FOR ME THOUGH

I DID A SHORT POSTHOC THEN DECIDED TO DO PROGRAMMING AND IT WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE I LEARNED PROGRAMMING AS A SIDE EFFECT OF THE PHD WORK I JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE OBSESSION NEEDED TO MAKE IT IN ACADEMIA DON'T GET ME WRONG I LOVED MY TIME DOING THE PHD YOU'LL NEVER GO INTO A SUBJECT AS DEEPLY AS THEN BUT IF YOU DO SOMETHING ELSE THERE ARE SO MANY MORE OPTIONS LIKE WHAT CITY YOU WANT TO LIVE IN ETC AND THE PAY IS BETTER
WHILE YOU'RE FIGURING OUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT YOUR PHYSICS AMBITIONS LOOK FOR MORE FULFILLING WORK THAN IN A CALL CENTER WITH A PHYSICS DEGREE THERE ARE A LOT OF OPTIONS YOU MIGHT FIND OTHER CAREERS THAT YOU TRULY LOVE BUT THAT'S UNLIKELY IN A CALL CENTER
YOU'RE NOT A PHYSICIST NOW WHOM JUST BECAUSE SOCIETY IS WILLING TO PAY ME SUBSTANTIALLY MORE MONEY TO DO SOMETHING OTHER THAN MY PERSONAL PASSION DOES NOT MEAN MY TRAINING AND PASSION WENT AWAY
I DROPPED OUT OF A PHYSICS PH D PROGRAM AND AM NOW A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER DBA LINUX SYSADMIN I BAILED BECAUSE THERE IS FAR MORE COMPETITION FOR POSITIONS IN PHYSICS WHICH MEANS A CASUAL LIKE MYSELF COULD NEVER MAKE IT AND 2 THE ONES WHO DO ARE VERY DRIVEN DOGWHISTLE

WENT BACK AND GOT A MASTER'S THEN GOT A CS DEGREE THE WORK IS INTERESTING AND MEANINGFUL THE PEOPLE ARE NICE AND I'M NOT SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE TRYING TO KEEP FROM DROWNING BY PUSHING ME DOWN
WHY AREN'T YOU WRITING TO PROFESSORS AND CULTIVATING RELATIONSHIPS FIND SOMEONE YOU TRUST OR ADMIRE AND ASK THEM FOR SUGGESTIONS ON WHICH MATERIAL TO STUDY
THIS IS FOR PHD THERE IS ONE FOR BACHELORS THIS WAS JUST BOOKMARKER SO LINKING HERE THIS SITE OFFERS A GOOD RESEARCH DATA ON CAREERS OF PHYSICIST SOMETHING THAT WILL HELP
YOU COULD LEARN TO PROGRAM AND START CONTRIBUTING TO OPEN SOURCE SCIENCE SOFTWARE LIBRARIES
TRY AGAIN MAYBE AIM A BIT LOWER I EAST SOMETHING OTHER THAN QUANTUM GRAVITY NOTHING STOPS YOU FROM LEARNING ABOUT IT ON YOUR OWN TIME

THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO KEEP MOVING IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WAKE UP YEARS FROM NOW SITTING IN THE SAME CALL CENTER YOU HAVE TO KEEP ON LEARNING AND DISTURBING YOUR EQUILIBRIUM I GOT IN A GOOD GRAD SCHOOL BUT WITH BASICALLY SUPPORT NOT THAT THE PI DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE ANY BUT RATHER THAT THEY DIDN'T REALLY FOSTER A COOPERATIVE AND LIVELY ENVIRONMENT AND I LOST MY INTEREST

I SPENT YEARS THERE DOING MOSTLY OTHER THINGS THAN MY PROJECT I LEARNED A HUGE AMOUNT OF THINGS BUT THEY WEREN'T DIRECTLY RELATED TO MY THESIS SO IN THE END I FOUND A JOB NONETHELESS BECAUSE I HAD DEVELOPED USEFUL SKILLS

I SUGGEST YOU KEEP CHALLENGING YOURSELF BECAUSE IT'S SO EASY TO FOSSILIZE IN A STATE OF RELATIVE HAPPINESS STABILITY NOT THAT THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH ANY JOB IN PARTICULAR BUT IF YOU DON'T LIKE YOURS THERE'S REALLY NOTHING ELSE YOU CAN DO BUT FORCE YOURSELF OUT OF YOUR EQUILIBRIUM

GOOD LUCK
I GOT HALFWAY THROUGH MY DEGREE THEN REALISED I DIDN'T WANT TO CONTINUE PHYSICS

I FINISHED THAT DEGREE GOT OUT AND NOW I LOVE PHYSICS AGAIN

IT'S WHAT I DO TO PROCRASTINATE WHY COULDN'T I DO THAT AS A STUDENT

I'LL ALWAYS HATE WHAT I DO
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER MY LIFE HAS IMPROVED DRAMATICALLY IN EVERY WAY I CAN AFFORD TO TRAVEL CAN AFFORD TO BUY REAL ESTATE AND SOME OTHER NICE THINGS WHILE MY JOB HAS TRANSITIONED TO A DATA SCIENCE ROLE THAT I QUITE LIKE AND IS NOT AT ALL THAT DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I WAS DOING BEFORE FLEXIBLE HOURS NERDY ENVIRONMENT BUT MAKING WHAT I WAS MAKING BEFORE

ALL MY DREAMS IN PHYSICS WERE ABOUT GAINING UNDERSTANDING WHEN IT COMES TO MY CAREER AND EXPECTATIONS IN LIFE ACADEMIA COULD SIMPLY NOT FULFILL THEM
HEY OP I CAN'T REALLY HELP YOU BUT I THOUGHT I'D SHARE WHAT'S ON MY MIND SINCE I CAN RELATE I'M AND I'VE BEEN INTO SCIENCE SINCE ALWAYS LOTS OF DISCOVERY CHANNEL ANIMAL PLANET TONS OF KIDS ENCYCLOPEDIAS WHEN I WAS LITTLE I LIKE MATH AND OTHER LOGIC ORIENTED SUBJECTS TOO LIKE PROGRAMMING BUT PHYSICS ABOVE ALL I'VE ALWAYS BEEN CURIOUS GOOD GRADES SORT OF SMART BUT THESE LAST YEARS PHYSICS BECAME A BIT OF AN OBSESSION LIKE YOU I READ POPULAR SCIENCE BOOKS I READ TEXTBOOKS TEACH MYSELF CALCULUS A BIT I PRACTICE FOR AND PARTICIPATE IN THOSE NATIONAL PHYSICS COMPETITIONS WE HAVE ETC I DO ENJOY SOLVING PROBLEMS BUT THE ALLURE OF PHYSICS COMES FROM LEARNING HOW THE UNIVERSE WORKS BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT SOMETHING ORDINARY AND TO IMAGINE ALL THE STUFF HAPPENING ON EVERY SCALE THE ENERGY FORCES ETC AND BEING ABLE TO DESCRIBE ALL OF THAT WITH MATHEMATICS MY POINT IS I THINK I ENJOY LEARNING THEORY MORE THAN APPLYING IT AND I THOUGHT I WANTED TO BECOME A PHYSICIST A BIT GENERAL BUT I DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC FIELD IN MIND BUT WHILE I'M OF ABOVE AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE I'M NOWHERE NEAR AS TALENTED AS SOME AND AS OTHER PEOPLE MENTIONED A CAREER IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS IS NOT EASY TO PULL OFFICIAL THIS MAKES ME DOUBT MY CHANCES OF SUCCESS IN MORE ACADEMIC FIELDS BUT WHEN I THINK OF LEARNING SOMETHING MORE PRACTICAL PERHAPS I DON'T QUITE FEEL THE SAME FASCINATION BUT RATHER LIKE I'M SETTLING FOR SOMETHING MEDIOCRE WHEN I COULD BE DOING MORE SIGNIFICANT THINGS AND BASICALLY YOUR SITUATION RIGHT NOW IS ONE OF MY BIGGEST FEARS
SO YEAH I MOSTLY WANTED TO GET THIS ALL OUT I DOUBT ANYONE WILL BOTHER READING THE WHOLE THING BUT SOME HELP WITH CAREER ORIENTATION WOULD BE WELCOME AND GOOD LUCK OP I REALLY HOPE IT WORKS OUT FOR YOU
FUNNY I ALSO WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GO INTO QUANTUM GRAVITY BECAUSE I THINK THATS WHERE EVERYTHING WILL COME TOGETHER

FOR ME PHYSICS WAS VERY CHALLENGING BUT WITH LITTLE REWARD LIKE IN THE SAME TIME THAT I WOULD NEED TO LEARN AN UNDERGRAD COURSE I COULD HAVE MASTERED COURSES IN ENGINEERING OR MTH DIFFERENT

SO YEAH I'M CURRENTLY DOING A MASTERS DEGREE IN PHYSICAL ENGINEERING ITS NOT AS FUNDAMENTAL AS THEORETICAL PHYSICS BUT ITS STILL CHALLENGING IT TEACHES A LOT OF DIFFERENT SKILLS AND IS SOMEWHAT EASIER

ITS SOMEWHAT ROMANTIC TO THINK ABOUT THEORETICAL RESEARCH BUT WHAT I WOULD HAVE HOPED FROM IT IS TO MAKE A FUNDAMENTAL DISCOVERY SOME GROUNDBREAKING WIDENING OF THE HORIZONS OF OUR KNOWLEDGE BUT IM PRETTY SURE THIS JUST WONT HAPPEN UNLESS I WORK REEEAAAALLY HARD LIKE DAY DAYS A WEEK THINKING ABOUT PHYSICS PROBLEMS READING RESEARCH PAPERS ETC THIS JUST WONT HAPPEN

THERE ARE ALSO SOME OTHER INTERESTS THAT I HAVE AND WOULD LIKE TO PERSUE
I WAS A PHYSICS MAJOR UNTIL JUNIOR YEAR WHEN I SWITCHED TO ANTHROPOLOGY I'M A BARTENDER NOW ALL I DO WITH MY PHYSICS KNOWLEDGE NOW IS DAZZLE DRUNK CUSTOMERS OR I OCCASIONALLY GET TO EXPOSE SOMEONE WHO'S TALKING OUT OF THEIR ASS TO TRY TO IMPRESS WOMEN

EDIT YOU MAY STILL ACHIEVE YOUR MOST MEANINGFUL GOAL YOU JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS YET
DELETED
MY FRIEND WON A BUSINESS COMPETITION TO START A GUITAR PEDAL COMPANY I'M WORKING FOR HIM DESIGNING A LOOP PEDAL IT'S NOT PHYSICS REALLY BUT I STILL GET TO BE HANDS ON WITH ELECTRONICS AND I GET TO PLAY MUSIC AND THINK CREATIVELY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS SO I'M HAPPY STILL WONDER ABOUT WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN IF I WENT TO GRAD SCHOOL AND CONTINUED FURTHER
JUST FINISHED MY COMPUTER PROGRAMMING DIPLOMA

STILL HEAR ABOUT COOL PHYSICS HERE
QUIT MY MASTER'S AFTER ABOUT A YEAR AND FELT GUILTY AS FUCK

THEN I STARTED TRANSLATING AND NOW I'M HAPPY AS FUCK AND MAKE MORE MONEY THAN I EVER WOULD HAVE AS A PHYSICIST

I STILL MISS IT I MISS THE LAB AND I MISS WORKING ON THE BIG QUESTIONS AND LITTLE ONES LIKE WHY THE FUCK DOESN'T THIS CIRCUIT WORK

BUT YEARS LATER I'M HAPPY AND REGRET NOTHING
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED A NATIONAL LAB I WORK AT ONE DOING FAIRLY STUFF I'VE JUST GOT A BSC BUT THE PAY IS QUITE GOOD I COULD PICTURE MYSELF DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME
I AM AN ON AGAIN OFF AGAIN UNDERGRAD IN PHYSICS I AM CURRENTLY ATTEMPTING TO GET A JOB WITH SPACE AS A LOGISTICS TECHNICIAN FALLING BACK ON MY MILITARY EXPERIENCE TO GET A JOB THAT IS NOT AS SEXY AS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH POWER ION ENGINES LIKE I WANTED STILL PUSHING FORWARD ON MY GOAL OF TAKING HUMANITY TO THE STARS
RECENTLY GRADUATED WITH A PHYSICS DEGREE FROM A LARGE SCHOOL WITH A GOOD REPUTATION FOR RESEARCH I SPENT THREE YEARS DOING RESEARCH COAUTHORED TWO PAPERS DID POSTER AND ORAL PRESENTATIONS YADDA YADDA WOULD HAVE HAD A GOOD APPLICATION FOR GRADUATE PROGRAMS BUT I HATED THE RESEARCH PART

I COULDN'T STAND IT I STUCK IT OUT THROUGH MY UNDERGRAD YEARS BECAUSE I FELT LIKE I OWED IT TO THE PROFESSOR I WAS DOING RESEARCH WITH DOING RESEARCH MADE ME SEE THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO CONTINUE IN PHYSICS

SO I WENT TO LAW SCHOOL INSTEAD BECAUSE I GUESS I'M A MASOCHIST

BUT I'M REALLY LOVING LAW SCHOOL PHYSICS PREPARED ME FOR THE RIGORS OF LAW SCHOOL WAY BETTER THAN ENGLISH OR POLITICAL SCIENCE WOULD HAVE SINCE I WAS BEATEN DOWN BY FOUR YEARS OF PHYSICS LAW SCHOOL ISN'T SO BAD

ULTIMATELY I WANT TO MAKE SOME USE OF MY PHYSICS DEGREE AND PRACTICE PATENT LAW BUT I AM STEERING CLEAR OF ACADEMIC PHYSICS
YOU SHOULD LOOK FOR WORK IN A FIELD CLOSE TO WHAT YOU WANT TO STUDY OR IN PHYSICS OF ANY KIND PING YOUR OLD PROFESSORS FOR ADVICE AND POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITIES YOU'D HAVE TO MOVE FOR GRAD SCHOOL ANYWAY SO BE OPEN TO MOVING TO A PLACE WITH A NATIONAL LABORATORY OR A GOOD RESEARCH UNIVERSITY AFTER A YEAR OF WORK BUT BY THEN YOU MAY HAVE A PUBLICATION AND LETTERS FROM PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY KNOW YOUR WORK OH ONE MORE THING WHEN IF YOU GET A JOB WORK LIKE HELL AND TRY TO STAY POSITIVE ABOUT IT

REMEMBER BEFORE YOU TAKE A JOB OR GO OFF THE GRAD SCHOOL MAKE SURE THE OTHER PEOPLE WORKING THERE OR FOR THE SAME BOSS ARE RELATIVELY HAPPY WITH THEIR SITUATIONS KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN
WHILE I'M NO PHYSICIST A FRIEND OF MINE IS HE WORKED IN A LAB FOR A WHILE BEFORE DECIDING THAT HIS PASSION FOR MAKING MUSIC OUTWEIGHED HIS LOVE OF PHYSICS AT LEAST FOR NOW

IF YOU WANT TO CHECK OUT HIS STUFF IT'S

THERE HAVE BEEN QUITE A FEW ARTICLES WRITTEN ABOUT HIM IN LOCAL NEWSPAPERS DETAILING HIS ODD SWITCH FROM PHYSICS TO FOLK CHECK HIM OUT
BLAH YEAH I'VE BEEN INTERESTED IN QUANTUM GRAVITY FOR YEARS NOW AND DECIDED TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL FOR IT YEARS AGO ONLY RECENTLY A FEW MONTHS AGO DID I REALIZE THAT DESPITE THE OVERWHELMING AMOUNT OF PHYSICISTS IN THE FIELD URGING YOUNG PEOPLE TO JOIN IN THERE IS FAR TOO MUCH COMPETITION FOR THE FEW SPOTS AVAILABLE I STILL PLAN TO FINISH MY UNDERGRAD BUT IT'S SEEMING MORE AND MORE LIKE IT'S SIMPLY UNREALISTIC TO DIVE INTO IT VIA THE STRAIGHT ACADEMIA ROUTE

THE WORST PART ABOUT MY SITUATION IS THAT I'M GETTING MY UNDERGRAD AT A SCHOOL THAT HAS ZERO THEORETICAL PHYSICISTS THERE AREN'T ANY GENERAL RELATIVITY OR FIELD THEORY CLASSES OFFERED EVERYTHING I KNOW ABOUT Q I TAUGHT MYSELF THERE ARE NO TEACHERS TO EVEN TALK TO ABOUT IT AND FOR MY SENIOR SEMINAR I CAN'T DO IT BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO REVIEW IT THAT WAS MY LAST HOPE IF I DID A RESEARCH PROJECT APPLYING BAYESIAN NETWORKS TO ADS AFT IT MIGHT GIVE ME A COMPETITIVE EDGE BUT MY SCHOOL DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A COMPUTER SCIENCE PROGRAM

AT THIS POINT I'M GONNA GO BACK INTO IT EITHER PROGRAMMING OR GETTING NETWORK CERTIFICATIONS CANA CCIP ACIE IT STILL PAYS WELL AND THE PLAN IS TO GET A JOB IN SAN FRANCISCO MAYBE VISITING STANFORD TO SIT IN ON SEMINARS OR GRADUATE LEVEL CLASSES TO KEEP UP WITH THE FIELD I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SPEND MOST OF MY TIME ON THE STUFF BUT HELL I'LL BE MAKING MORE MONEY DOING AN APPARENTLY MUCH LESS STRESSFUL THING THERE'S ALSO NOTHING SAYING THAT YOU CAN'T A PAPER WITHOUT WORKING AT A SCHOOL
MOVE TO THE UK AND BECOME A COMEDIAN
CHANCELLOR OF GERMANY
PHYSICS IS WHERE YOU FIND IT MY FRIEND

AND REST ASSURED NOTHING IS SIMPLE OR JUST AS IT MAY SEEM TODAY
SO MY GOAL IS TO GET A JOB IN ASTROPHYSICS WITH WHATEVER UNIVERSITY I WIND UP GOING TO WITHIN THE NEXT FEW YEARS I AM NOW I WANTED TO GET MY MASTERS FIRST TRY TO FIND A JOB IN THE UNIVERSITY AND THEN FINISH GETTING A PHD DOES THIS SEEM LIKE AN UNREALISTIC GOAL IF I ALSO WANTED TO CONSIDER HAVING A FAMILY LATER ON IN LIFE MAYBE AT LEAST SPENDING YEARS TRYING TO ESTABLISH MY CAREER BEFORE STARTING A FAMILY
THE ENERGY IS IN MOLECULAR BONDS CHEMICAL REACTIONS TAKE PLACE SO CHEMICAL BONDS ARE BROKEN UP THE ATOMS REARRANGE IN DIFFERENT BONDS THE TOTAL ENERGY IS LESS THAN BEFORE AND THE EXCESS ENERGY IS RELEASED AS HEAT THAT'S BASICALLY BURNING
IT'S BEEN QUITE A WHILE SINCE I'VE PROGRAMMED A GPU BUT I BELIEVE U FFWIFFO S POINT

YOUR QUESTION CAN BE ANSWERED COMPLETELY YES APUS GIVE THE SAME ACCURATE RESULTS AS NON APUS

IS FUNDAMENTALLY INCORRECT THERE ARE MANY OPERATIONS ON APUS GENERALLY REDUCTION OPERATIONS WHICH ARE NOT DETERMINISTIC DUE TO THE ASYNCHRONOUS NATURE OF COMPUTATION AND THE RESULTING ROUNDING ADDITIONALLY IN APUS YOU'RE TYPICALLY CONFINED TO FLOATS WITH REDUCTIONS SO YOU DO HAVE ISSUES I DON'T KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT THE NEWEST GENERATION OF APUS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR APC HAVE ADDRESSED THIS

THAT BEING SAID PRETTY MUCH ANY NUMERICAL APPROACH IS APPROXIMATE REGARDLESS SO SMALL NUMERICAL ERRORS ARE IRRELEVANT PROVIDED THE ALGORITHM IS STABLE IN TERMS OF THE PRAGMATIC ACCURACY OF PREDICTIONS

EDIT APPARENTLY NEW APUS WITH CAPABILITY CAN DO DOUBLES ARITHMETIC
YOUR QUESTION CAN BE ANSWERED COMPLETELY YES APUS GIVE THE SAME ACCURATE RESULTS AS NON APUS

THE INSTRUCTION SET ON A GPU IS SMALLER THAN A CPU BUT HIGHLY VECTORIZED WHICH MAKES THEM GOOD CANDIDATES FOR SUPERCOMPUTING BECAUSE ESSENTIAL SUPERCOMPUTERS ARE GIANT VECTORIZED MACHINES

ALSO THE DIFFERENCE IN ARCHITECTURE BETWEEN A GPU AND CPU DOESN'T MEAN THERE ANY MISTAKES BEING MADE
AS LONG AS THE PROGRAMMER HAS TAKEN STEPS TO AVOID ROUNDING ERRORS WHICH EVERY COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICIST IS TAUGHT TO DO HOPEFULLY THEN THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE IN THE QUALITY OF MATH COMPUTED WITH A GPU OVER A CPU

FOR EXAMPLE IF I WANT TO CALCULATE THE PRESSURE OF A PLASMA ON A SURFACE DOSE GPU CAN GIVE ME THE EXACT NUMBER OR THE ANSWER IS WONDERING AROUND THE RIGHT NUMBER

THE GPU AND THE CPU GIVE THE SAME NUMBER AN APPROXIMATION COMPUTING IS DONE WITH DISCRETE MATHEMATICS IF YOU WANT AN EXACT ANSWER DO IT BY HAND

WHY DO MEASUREMENTS HAVE MEANING AT ALL WHEN THEY ARE MEASURING COMPONENTS OF A SINGLE THING

MOST LIKELY YOUR INTUITION IS FAILING YOU IGNORE COMBINED SPACETIME FOR A MOMENT AND JUST THINK ABOUT R EUCLIDEAN SPACE YOU COULD ASK THE SAME THING ABOUT MEASURING ALONG THE X DIMENSION AS COMPARED TO THE Y OR Z DIMENSIONS BUT YOU DON'T WHY ARE YOU BALKING WHEN TIME IS ADDED AS A DIMENSION BUT NOT Y AND Z

I MEAN THIS NOT NECESSARILY TO LEAD A AN AH HA MOMENT BUT AS A FRAMING DEVICE CONSIDER YOUR ASSUMPTIONS AND INTUITION CAREFUL AS YOU THINK ABOUT WHY ONE DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TIME AS A DIMENSION OF SPACETIME BUT THE OTHER DOES X Y AND Z AS INDEPENDENT DIMENSIONS OF R IN EUCLIDIAN SPACE DESPITE R BEING A SINGLE THING

IF DISTANCE AND TIME ARE THE COMPONENTS OF VELOCITY THEY ARE JUST SEEMINGLY TWO DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS OF THE SAME THING SPACE-TIME BEING COMPARED TO THEMSELVES

VELOCITY HAS TWO COMPONENTS DIRECTION AND MAGNITUDE BUT AT IT'S CORE YOU'RE RIGHT THAT THE DISTANCE TRAVELED AND THE TIME REQUIRED TO TRAVEL IT MAKES UP THE MAGNITUDE PORTION

AGAIN GO BACK TO WHAT IS COMFORTABLE I'M ASSUMING YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THE IDEA OF A SLOPE ON A LINE WHICH CAN BE DESCRIBED AS THE MAGNITUDE OF CHANGE OF THE LINE IT'S DEFINED AS NOTHING MORE THAN DY DX X AND Y IN THIS CASE ARE BOTH PART OF THE SAME THING THE R 2 EUCLIDEAN PLANE BUT THE ABILITY TO DERIVE MEANING IN TERMS OF THE SLOPE OF THE LINE SHOULD BE OBVIOUS SPACETIME AND SPEED MAGNITUDE IS NO DIFFERENT
THE THREE SPACE DIRECTIONS ARE ALSO PART OF THE SAME THING SPACE YET YOU CAN MEASURE LENGTH OF A ONE-DIMENSIONAL THING

FOR EXAMPLE IF DISTANCE AND TIME ARE THE COMPONENTS OF VELOCITY THEY ARE JUST SEEMINGLY TWO DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS OF THE SAME THING SPACE-TIME BEING COMPARED TO THEMSELVES

SPACE AND TIME ARE NOT COMPONENTS OF VELOCITY VELOCITY DEPENDS ON THE CHANGE IN POSITION OVER A TIME BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT HAS TO DO WITH SPACETIME COORDINATES DIRECTLY

YOU PROBABLY SHOULD START WITH CLASSICAL MECHANICS AND GET A GOOD INTUITION OF THAT FIRST BEFORE CONSIDERING RELATIVITY AND SPACETIME
I HOPE THAT THIS WILL HELP YOU
FIRST TENSORS AREN'T INTRINSIC TO RELATIVITY THEY ARE USED WITHIN GOOD OLD 3D SPACE IN OTHER CONTEXTS MOST NOTABLY FLUID MECHANICS AND EM

THE POINT OF USING THEM IN RELATIVITY IS THAT YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THINGS IN THE CONTEXT OF SPACETIME THE RELATIVISTIC TRANSFORMATIONS AND LAWS ARE BEST UNDERSTOOD IN MINKOWSKI SPACETIME WHICH IS A FOUR DIMENSIONAL VECTOR SPACE WITH A SLIGHTLY WEIRD INNER PRODUCT ONE WHICH HAS A MINUS SIGN IN THE TIME COMPONENT USING TENSORS AND INDEX NOTATION FOR THIS MAKES EVERYTHING EASIER

I GOTTA SAY THOUGH I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT BERGMANN IS TRYING TO SAY FROM YOUR QUOTE IT'S TRUE THAT IN A GALILEAN TRANSFORMATION TIME REMAINS INTACT AND THAT IT MIXES WITH THE OTHER COORDINATES UNDER A LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT T RETAINS ITS CUSTOMARY POSITION MEANS YOU CAN'T FORMULATE LAWS IN SUCH A WAY THAT T DOESN'T TRANSFORM BECAUSE IT DOES UNLESS HE MEANS PROPER TIME WHICH IS A SCALAR
I GUESS THIS MEANS THAT RELATIVISTIC LAWS CAN BE REFORMULATED SO THAT T TRANSFORMS ONTO ITSELF LIKE IN THE CLASSICAL LAWS

IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND YOU WANT LAWS TO TRANSFORM ACCORDING TO SPECIAL RELATIVITY CLASSICAL LAWS ARE COVARIANT RESPECT TO GALILEAN TRANSFORMATIONS BUT NOW YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE LAWS COVARIANT TO LORENTZ TRANSFORMATIONS TENSOR NOTATION CALCULUS IS SO THAT YOU CAN CONSTRUCT NEW OBJECTS THAT TRANSFORM ACCORDING TO SPECIAL RELATIVITY

TENSORS ARE JUST MAPS THEY POP UP ALL OVER PHYSICS
EITHER YOUR PROBLEM IS ALREADY LINEAR OR YOU LINEARIZE IT IN SOME
POINT

MY PROF HIGHLIGHTED THE FACT THAT WE WANT OUR EQUATIONS TO LOOK THE SAME IN EVERY INERTIAL SYSTEM
I FOUND TESTS AT SCHOOL EXTREMELY EASY GOT INTO A TOP UNIVERSITY IN THE UK FOR PHYSICS AND THEN FOUND THAT WHEN I HAD TESTS THAT WERE ACTUALLY CHALLENGING THAT I MASSIVELY LOST MY NERVE AND DID VERY BADLY IN TEST CONDITIONS

I GOT LUCKY AND GOT A PHD AT A MUCH LOWER RANKED UNIVERSITY AND AM NOW AN EARLY CAREER RESEARCHER WITH REASONABLY GOOD PROSPECTS OF CARRYING ON IN THIS FIELD SO IT IS POSSIBLE

ALL THAT SAID HOWEVER I DID GET LUCKY A FEW TIMES IN TERMS OF WHAT I ENDED UP DOING AND I AM ALSO IN A HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL NEAR ENGINEERING FIELD AND I AM GENUINELY VERY GOOD AT EXPERIMENTAL AND PRACTICAL WORK I FEEL LIKE YOU MAY BE WORSE OFF IN THEORETICAL AREAS
MY UNDERGRAD AVERAGE WAS MUCH LESS THAN NOT PREPARED TO ADMIT WHAT IT WAS EXACTLY THOUGH

THE KEY THING I'VE FOUND IS IF YOU CAN GET INTO A NICHE FIELD WHICH YOU'RE GENUINELY INTERESTED IN BUT ISN'T ESPECIALLY SEXY OR EXCITING THEN YOU CAN FIND A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES

IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO BUILD REACTORS AND GOVERNMENTS ARE NOT WILLING TO PUT ENOUGH MONEY IN BESIDES I WOULD ADVISE SEARCHING THIS SUB AS WELL AS R SCIENCE R ASKSCIENCE R ASKPHYSICS THERE'S A LOT OF BIG THREADS DISCUSSING ALL THE DETAILS OF FUSION

HAS A LOT OF INFORMATION

R SCIENCE COMMENTS

HERE'S AN AMA OF WENDELSTEIN X PHYSICISTS FROM AND THEY DISCUSS A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS

R ASKSCIENCE COMMENTS QDBXG

HERE'S ANOTHER OLDER AMA

THAT SAID YOU SPEAK OF BECOMING A NUCLEAR PHYSICIST BUT I THINK YOU WOULDN'T REALLY BE CONCERNING YOURSELF WITH FUSION NECESSARILY AS BUILDING A REACTOR IS NOW MOSTLY AN ENGINEERING PROBLEM THE NECESSARY FUSION REACTIONS HAVE BEEN FIGURED OUT THERE'S A LOT OF PROCESSES GOING ON IN NUCLEI REGARDING THE STRONG AND WEAK NUCLEAR FORCES THAT ARE PROBABLY CLOSER TO WHAT NUCLEAR PHYSICISTS DEAL WITH
THE PHYSICS OF SCALE IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE THE REACTOR THERE ARE SEVERAL FACTORS YOU CAN CHANGE ONE BEING REACTOR SIZE ANOTHER ONE BEING MAGNETIC CONFINEMENT FIELD STRENGTH AT THE TIME ITER WAS PLANNED WE HIT A WALL IN TERMS OF MAGNETIC FIELD STRENGTH IN SUPER CONDUCTING MAGNETS THE FIELD WAS SO STRONG THAT IT DISRUPTED THE SUPER CONDUCTIVITY CAUSING THE FIELD TO COLLAPSE

SO THE ONLY WAY TO MOVE FORWARD FROM THERE WAS TO BUILD A HUGE REACTOR UNFORTUNATELY THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IS THAT THE PROJECT GOES FROM BEING NATIONAL SCALE TO INTERNATIONAL SCALE IN TERMS OF FINANCING WITH ALL THE POLITICS THAT COMES FROM THAT SLOWING DOWN THE PROCESS

ANOTHER MORE SUBTLE THING THAT YOU DONT HEAR TOO MUCH ABOUT IS THE THE REACTOR MATERIAL ISSUE THE REACTOR WALL GETS BOMBARDED WITH NEUTRONS WHICH GRADUALLY BREAKS DOWN THE MATERIAL IN ADDITION THE REACTOR WALL NEEDS TO CONTAIN LITHIUM BECAUSE IT NEEDED TO BREED TRITIUM WHICH IS ONE OF THE FUSION REACTION COMPONENTS THIS IS ONE OF THE CAUSES OF THE BREAKDOWN LITHIUM IS A DIFFICULT MATERIAL TO DEAL WITH IN ITSELF BUT IT HAS TO BE ENGINEERED INTO A WALL SEGMENT THAT YOU CAN STOP THE REACTOR AND REPLACE WHEN IT GETS WORN OUT SOME PEOPLE IN THE FUSION BUSINESS WILL TELL YOU IT IS PROBABLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THIS WORKING PROPERLY IN A PRODUCTION REACTOR BASED ON THE ITER DESIGN

SO NOW ITER LOOKS A BIT LIKE A DEAD END BUT WE STILL HAVE THIS PROBLEM OF THE WORLD NEEDING INCREASING AMOUNTS OF ELECTRICITY AND WE CAN'T BURN MORE FOSSIL FUELS IN FACT WE HAVE TO CUT THAT WAY BACK IN ORDER FOR RAMPANT GLOBAL WARMING NOT TO BECOME A SERIOUS CIVILIZATION THREATENING ISSUE SO WE KEEP PRESSING ON BECAUSE THE POTENTIAL BENEFIT IF WE CAN MAKE IT ALL WORK IS SO PROMISING

A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE REALIZED THAT GOING BIG IS PROBABLY NOT VIABLE AND HAVE STARTED TO REINVESTIGATE PREVIOUSLY ABANDONED FUSION EXPERIMENTS TO SEE IF NEW TECHNOLOGIES COULD HELP MAKE THOSE APPROACHES VIABLE AGAIN

HERE ARE SOME VIDEOS WORTH WATCHING ON A COUPLE OF THE ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES

GENERAL FUSION

MIT EXPERIMENTS
YOU WOULD PROBABLY FIND THE OMEGA TAU PODCAST ON ITER TO BE INTERESTING IT GOES INTO A LOT OF THE DETAILS OF THE GOALS OF CURRENT FUSION PROJECTS AND CURRENT ISSUES

FIELDS THAT COULD BE RELEVANT IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER
PHYSICS
NUCLEAR ENGINEERING
MATERIALS SCIENCE
I WROTE A BIT ABOUT THAT HERE BASICALLY A PROFITABLE MACHINE WOULD HAVE TO BE SO HUGE AND RESOURCE INTENSIVE THAT NOBODY IS WILLING TO INVEST ENOUGH TO MAKE THE INVESTMENT WORTHWHILE
THE ESTIMATE I HAVE HEARD WAS YEARS IT JUST TAKES A WHILE WITH FINITE FUNDING AND MANPOWER I SUPPOSE SO FAR THEY HAVE STUDIED FUSION IN JET FOR USE THEY HAVE NOT EVEN REACHED THE BREAK-EVEN POINT THERE THE POINT WHERE YOU GET MORE ENERGY OUT THAN YOU PUT INTO HEATING NEXT ONE WILL BE ITER WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO FINISH CONSTRUCTION IN A FEW YEARS THEY INTEND TO DEMONSTRATE THAT OUTPUTS WELL ABOVE THE BREAK-EVEN POINT ARE POSSIBLE THEN IF THAT GOES WELL YEARS MAYBE DEMO FOLLOWS A PROJECT THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BUILD A REACTOR THAT COULD IN THEORY BE A FIRST PROTOTYPE COMMERCIAL USE REACTOR NOTE THAT I'M NO EXPERT BUT RECENTLY ATTENDED A LECTURE ON THIS
CARBON DATING IS USELESS FOR TELLING YOU THE AGE OF A PREHISTORIC FOSSIL IT'S ONE TOOL USED IN TANDEM WITH MANY OTHER ANALYTICAL METHODS IN ORDER TO FIND OUT WHEN SOMETHING WAS ONCE ALIVE THE POINT IS THAT WE USE CARBON DATING BECAUSE IT'S REMARKABLY ACCURATE WHEN IT'S APPLICABLE

THE REASON FOR THIS IS BECAUSE OTHER METHODS ARE GENERALLY INDIRECT WAYS OF DATING SOMETHING I EAST GEOLOGIC STRATA USING ANATOMY FROM KNOWN BIOLOGICAL LINEAGES ETC WHEREAS CARBON DATING IS A DIRECT WAY TO MEASURE THE AGE OF SOMETHING THUS PROVIDING DIRECT EVIDENCE

ALSO A BIG BIG BIG PLUS OF CARBON DATING AND ALL OTHER BASED METHODS OF INQUIRY IS THAT IT WILL TELL YOU EXACTLY HOW WRONG IT IS I EAST IT'LL GIVE YOU A RANGE I'VE NEVER MET A CREATIONIST WHO'LL TELL YOU WHEN THEY MIGHT BE INCORRECT ABOUT SOMETHING
IT DEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF THE THING THE REAL AGE OF THE THING THE CONDITION OF THE THING INCLUDING SITE CONDITIONS STORAGE CONDITIONS THE SIZE OF THE THING

CARBON DATING USES THE RATIO BETWEEN AN UNSTABLE FORM OF CARBON WHICH DECAYS AT A PRECISELY KNOWN RATE AND A STABLE FORM OF CARBON TO DETERMINE HOW MANY HALF-LIVES HAVE GONE BY SINCE THE SAMPLE DIED

THE TECHNIQUE DEPENDS ON THE INITIAL RATIO IN THE ATMOSPHERE AT THE TIME THE SAMPLE LIVED IN THE EARLY DAYS OF RADIOCARBON DATING ABOUT YEARS AGO THE ATMOSPHERIC RATIO WAS ASSUMED TO BE CONSTANT SUBSEQUENT EXPERIMENTS SHOWED THAT THIS WAS NOT THE CASE AND CALIBRATION TABLES TO CORRECT FOR THAT WERE DEVELOPED USING INDEPENDENT TECHNIQUES

THE HALF-LIFE OF THE UNSTABLE ISOTOPE OF CARBON I EAST CARBON OR IS ABOUT YEARS BECAUSE HALF THE AMOUNT OF CARBON EVAPORATES FOR EVERY HALF-LIFE AFTER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME ABOUT HALF-LIVES THERE IS NOT ENOUGH TO CALCULATE A RATIO HALF-LIVES OF IS ABOUT YEARS THAT IS THE LIMIT FOR SUCCESSFULLY USING CARBON DATING THERE ARE OTHER TECHNIQUES INCLUDING RADIOACTIVE DECAY TECHNIQUES FOR DATING OLDER OBJECTS BUT THE DON'T RELY ON CARBON BECAUSE OF THE HALF-LIFE LIMIT OF CARBON DATING IT CANNOT BE USED TO DATE DINOSAUR FOSSILS MILLION YO OR DIFFERENT EARLY HOMINIDS YO


IN FACT BECAUSE FOSSILISATION INVOLVES THE REPLACEMENT OF THE ORIGINAL ORGANIC MATERIAL WITH MINERALS ACTUAL FOSSILS CAN'T EVEN BE CARBON DATED IN PRINCIPLE THE ORIGINAL CARBON HAS BEEN REPLACED

THERE ARE LIMITATIONS ON CARBON DATING ORGANIC MATERIAL YO CONTAMINATION ISSUES DIFFICULTIES BUT THE LIMITATIONS ARE WELL UNDERSTOOD NOW THERE ARE CHEMICAL AND GENETIC TECHNIQUES TO HELP DETECT CONTAMINATION EQUIPMENT CAN DETECT AN INDIVIDUAL

IN THE TIME RANGE AND SAMPLE RANGE WHERE IT'S APPLICABLE IT IS ACCURATE AND THE LIMITS ON THE ACCURACY CAN BE MEASURED OR CALCULATED

IT IS IMPORTANT TO ALSO COMPARE THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE FROM THE SCIENTIFIC SIDE AND THE CREATIONIST SIDE THERE ARE LITERAL AND FIGURATIVE MOUNTAINS OF EVIDENCE FROM DOZENS OF INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC SOURCES AGAINST THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE BEING A LITERALLY ACCURATE OF ACTUAL HISTORIC EVENTS BEGINNING YEARS AGO

WHAT ACTUAL EVIDENCE DOES YOUR FRIEND USE IN SUPPORT OF THE CLAIMS IN THEIR HOLY BOOK THE BOOK ITSELF IS NOT EVIDENCE THE BOOK IS THE CLAIM MOST OF THE TIME I SEE CREATIONIST TRY TO ARGUE AGAINST THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE AS IN THIS CASE AND THEN ASSUME VICTORY WITHOUT PRESENTING ANY EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THEIR CLAIMS AT ALL
HYPERPHYSICS EXPLAINS IT WELL

ABASE NUCLEAR
A LOT OF PEOPLE MENTION LENGTH YOU HAVE TO DECIDE IS THIS A RESUME OR A CV RESUMES ARE SHORT AND GENERAL LISTING SKILLS RATHER THAN EXPERIENCE THEY ARE NOT USUALLY USED AT HIGH LEVELS OF ACADEMIA I NO LONGER MAINTAIN A RESUME AS A POSTHOC AND HAVEN'T SINCE I STARTED GRAD SCHOOL CBS ARE MEANT TO BE EVERY ACCOMPLISHMENT EVER KEEP IT ACADEMIC THOUGH SOME PROFESSORS HAVE SHORT AND LONG CBS AND THE SHORT ONES ARE STILL A COUPLE PAGES

THAT SAID ABOUT THE CV PART THESE GUYS ARE READING A MILLION OF THESE IF YOU GO THE CV ROUTE MAKE SURE THE IMPORTANT INFORMATION IS FIRST THE THINGS THEY WANT TO SEE BECAUSE CHANCE IS THEY AREN'T READING THE WHOLE THING UNLESS YOU'RE IN THE FINAL CUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THEY WANT TO SEE IS RESEARCH EXPERIENCE AND CONGRATS YOU HAVE PRETTY EXTENSIVE RESEARCH EXPERIENCE FOR YOUR LEVEL

I DON'T KNOW WHY GA IS MENTIONED TWICE PUT IT WITH THE EDUCATION PART

DOES YOUR RELEVANT COURSEWORK INCLUDE NEXT SEMESTER YOU'LL HAVE COMPLETED THAT BY THE START OF THE SUMMER SO PUT SOMETHING LIKE WILL HAVE COMPLETED BY SUMMER ELECTRODYNAMICS II OR AMII OR YOUR COURSEWORK SO FAR IS ONLY THE BASICS REQUIRED OF THE DEGREE WILL YOU HAVE ADVANCED TOPICS CLASSES BY THE SUMMER PARTICLES CONDENSED MATTER CHEM FOR MATH ABSTRACT ALGEBRA OR SOME OTHER TOPICS COURSE

GOOD LUCK
REMOVE YOUR NAME AND PERSONAL INFORMATION AND POST A LINK ALSO AS AN UNDERGRAD YOU SHOULD BE FITTING EVERYTHING ONTO A SINGLE PAGE RESUME UNLESS YOU HAVE A LOT OF PUBLICATIONS ALREADY
KEEP IT PAGE YOU'RE STILL IN SCHOOL

WHAT COURSES HAVE YOU TAKEN MIGHT BE MORE USEFUL THAN WHAT YOU HAVE AS INTERESTS THERE

HAVE YOUR GA WITH YOUR BS
I THINK I ONCE USED THAT SAME FORMAT AND A LOT OF THE SAME SKILLS RESUMES ARE HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE BUT THESE ARE MY SUGGESTIONS AFTER SPENDING A LOT OF TIME ON MY OWN RESUME

USE A DENSER FORMAT THERE IS A LOT OF WHITE SPACE A RESUME SHOULD ALWAYS BE ONE OR TWO PAGES NEVER ONE AND A HALF FIT EVERYTHING ON ONE PAGE USE UP ALL THAT SPACE IN THE MARGINS SOMETHING MORE LIKE THIS BUT DO NOT USE THAT FONT

TRY TO THINK OF THE MOST RELEVANT QUESTIONS A PERSON READING THIS WILL WANT ANSWERED AND PUT THOSE ANSWERS AT THE TOP FIRST ARE YOU REALLY INTERESTED OR ARE YOU JUST SHOTGUNNING RESUMES ANYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE INCLUDE THE NAME OF THE PROGRAM IN THE INTERESTS SECTION SEE BELOW AND BE SURE TO MAKE IT CLEAR YOU HAVE DONE RESEARCH ON THE PROGRAM AND HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT YOU'D WANT TO DO THERE NEXT ARE YOU QUALIFIED YOU HAVE AN EXCELLENT GA AND SHOULD BE PROUD OF IT PUT IT NEAR THE TOP ALSO RENAME ACADEMIC POSITIONS TO RESEARCH EXPERIENCE OR ACADEMIC EXPERIENCE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

THIS RESTRICTION MAY BE RELAXED FOR A SMALL AEU PROGRAM BUT YOUR RESUME SHOULD BE COMPUTER READABLE I ENDED UP REWRITING MY RESUME IN WORD BECAUSE PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO SIFT RESUMES WILL HAVE A MUCH EASIER TIME WITH THAN LATEX

INTERESTS SHOULD BE REWORKED INTO A SENTENCE OR TWO THAT EXPRESSES THE GOAL OF THIS RESUME AS WELL AS YOUR INTERESTS THIS IN PARTICULAR SHOULD BE CUSTOMIZED FOR THE PARTICULAR AEU PROGRAM YOU'RE APPLYING FOR USE THE NAME OF THE SCHOOL AND DEPARTMENT

DITCH LANGUAGES SOFTWARE ITS REDUNDANT INCLUDE A SHORT LIST OF THE STUPID STUFF LIKE EXCEL WORD PPT ALONGSIDE YOUR OTHER MORE INTERESTING SKILLS

THIS IS HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE BUT I WAS A LOT MORE HAPPY WITH MY RESUME WHEN I USED SHORT DESCRIPTIVE PARAGRAPHS DESCRIBING MY EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE THAN WHEN I USED BULLET POINTS SIMILARLY I DROPPED BULLET POINTS ON MY VERSION OF THE AWARDS ETC AND COURSEWORK SECTION AND LISTED EVERYTHING IN A KIND OF BORDERLESS TABLE OR DELIMITED WITH TAKES UP MUCH LESS SPACE AND DOESN'T BREAK THE FLOW OF THE RESUME AS AGGRESSIVELY AS THOSE BIG BULLETS DO

CONDENSE POSTERS AND TALK INTO ONE SECTION DO THE SAME TO SCHOLARSHIPS AWARDS HONORS AND PROFESSIONAL AND ACADEMIC SOCIETIES GENERALLY THE DESCRIPTION OF THE LIST SHOULD NOT BE LONGER THAN THE LIST ITSELF


WHAT IS YOUR METRIC FOR HOW GOOD A CLOUD CHAMBER IS IT'S A DETECTOR SO AS LONG AS YOU CAN SEE PARTICLE TRAILS IT'S GOOD ENOUGH AND DOESN'T REALLY NEED TO BE MORE EFFICIENT

WHAT I WOULD RECOMMEND IS USING THE CLOUD CHAMBER AS A MEASUREMENT DEVICE FOR A PROJECT INVOLVING RADIATION

SHIELDING AND INTERACTION WITH E M FIELDS WOULD BE INTERESTING TO LOOK INTO AS PROJECT IDEAS ESPECIALLY THE FIELD INTERACTION SINCE THAT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN EXPLORE WITH A CLOUD CHAMBER BUT NOT WITH A GEIGER COUNTER

IF YOU DON'T HAVE RADIATION SOURCES WHICH IT SEEMS LIKE YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE FROM ANOTHER COMMENT YOU LEFT CRACK OPEN A SMOKE DETECTOR OR GO TO AN ANTIQUE STORE AND LOOK FOR SOME ORANGE FIESTAWARE OR CLOCKS
SOUNDS LIKE YOUR TEACHER DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT A CLOUD CHAMBER IS
A WISE MAN ONCE SAID THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SCIENCE AND JUST SECRETING AROUND I'D WRITING IT DOWN I'D SUGGEST GETTING IT WORKING THEN TAKING IT DIFFERENT PLACES AND TAKE MEASUREMENTS EVERY DAY PLACES LIKE YOUR BEDROOM YOUR BASEMENT THE CLASSROOM WORLD WORK BUT OTHER COOL LOCATIONS LIKE A MOUNTAIN TOP OR DOWN A MINE SHAFT WOULD BE REALLY COOL
WAIT WHAT WILL YOU USE FOR A RADIATION SOURCE DO YOU HAVE THE PROPER PAPERWORK FOR SAID RADIATION SOURCE
TUNING THE OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS YOU HAVE CONTROL OVER WHATEVER THEY ARE AND MEASURING HOW WELL THE THING WORKS SHOULD QUALIFY
INTERESTING THAT IT WAS NOT QUITE SIGMA
DOES THIS MEAN WE COULD MAKE PURE COLLIDES WOULD THAT EVEN BE USEFUL
THANKS FOR POSTING THIS

THIS TOPIC IS MY TOTALLY FAVORITE PART OF PHYSICS
SO I SPEND ALOT OF MY TIME ALSO DOING LASER SPECTROSCOPY SPECIFICALLY RAMAN
THERE WAS A TIME WHERE I WAS INVESTIGATING A SAMPLE AND NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF BROADBAND SIGNAL IN THE SPECTRA TO THE POINT WHERE I THOUGHT I HAD GENERATED A SUPERCONTINUUM LASER SOMEHOW BY EXCITING MULTIPLE STATES AT ONCE
I REPEATED THIS OVER THE SAMPLE AGAIN AND AGAIN AND THERE WAS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT I HAD CREATED WHITE LIGHT THIS LIGHT WAS EVEN BRIGHT AND EASILY VISIBLE TO THE EYE
EVENTUALLY I REALISED THAT I HAD THE POWER METER THE WRONG SIDE OF THE BEAM SPLITTER AND WAS ACTUALLY PUTTING MORE POWER ON THE SAMPLE THAN I HAD THOUGHT BASICALLY I DISCOVERED FIRE BY BURNING THE SAMPLE SO NOT A GREAT DISCOVERY

FAR FROM A NOBEL BUT AT LEAST TWO TIMES I'VE HAD A NEW IDEA FOR MY FIELD THAT AFTER A PATENT SEARCH TURNS OUT TO BE PUBLISHED THAT VERY SAME YEAR

ONCE I DID NOT FIND ANYTHING AND GOT REALLY EXCITED ABOUT MONTHS LATER THE PATENT CAME OUT SO I HAD THE IDEA DURING THE BLIND MONTH PERIOD BUT THE PATENT WAS FILED BEFORE
IN UNDERGRAD MY LAB PARTER AND I WERE DOING SUPERSONIC FLOW SIMULATIONS AND ANSWERING THE ASSIGNED QUESTIONS HE STARTED GETTING REALLY EXCITED BECAUSE THIS SAME CONSTANT KEPT COMING UP SO HE THOUGHT HE WAS ON TO SOMETHING TURNS OUT IT WAS JUST MACH NUMBER


IN UNDERGRAD WE FOUND OUT THAT OUR SOLAR PERFORMANCE WAS OFF THE CHARTS TURNS OUT THOSE MOTHERFUCKING THERMOCOUPLE WERE NOT CALIBRATED PROPERLY BY OUR PROFESSOR
WHEN I WAS IN GRAD SCHOOL WE WERE DOING PLASMA SPECTROSCOPY WE WERE LOOKING AT VERY LOW PRESSURE FOR US THAT WAS TORR NITROGEN HELIUM PLASMA AND FOUND A TON OF LINES WE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE AT HIGHER PRESSURES TORR THEY WERE REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY WERE NARROW IMPLYING A HIGH MASS AND OPPOSITE IN PHASE TO THE CATIONS WE TYPICALLY STUDIED IMPLYING A NEGATIVE CHARGE WE WERE STUMPED TILL WE SEARCHED THE LITERATURE FOR HEAVY NITROGEN ANIONS AND CAME ACROSS A RING OF NITROGEN ATOMS WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AROMATIC MEANING IT WOULD BE RESONANCE STABILIZED LIKE BENZENE SO IT WOULD BE PARTICULARITY STABLE WE SEARCHED MORE THE SPECTRAL REGION AND FOUND THE SAME SPECTRA OVER AND OVER WHICH MEANT WE WERE SEEING THE DIFFERENT VIBRATIONAL BANDS

THIS WENT ON FOR A WHILE BUT SOMETHING DIDN'T SEEM QUITE RIGHT THE VIBRATIONAL BANDS WERE WAY TOO FAR APART FOR A HEAVY MOLECULE AND WHAT WAS PREDICTED IN THE THEORIST'S PAPERS SO I LOOKED AT THE DATA FOR EXCITED STATES OF NITROGEN AND MY HEART SANK IT WAS JUST AN EXCITED STATE TRANSITION OF MOLECULES SEEN DECADES AGO WE LEARNED SOME INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT HOW OUR SYSTEM WORKS AT LOW PRESSURES BUT OUR GROUND BREAKING DISCOVERY WAS BORING OLD NITROGEN
NOT AN EXPERIMENTALIST NOT A PHYSICIST NOT EVEN A SCIENTIST HAM RADIO OPERATOR HERE WAS BUILDING AN ANTENNA FIGURING OUT HOW MUCH POWER THE ANTENNA COULD HANDLE I DISCOVERED A WAY TO INCREASE THE POWER FROM WATTS TO WATTS WITHOUT ADDING IN EXTRA VOLT OR AMPERAGE I WAS JUSTIFIABLY EXCITED

OBVIOUSLY I DID THE MATH WRONG I DIDN'T FIND A WAY TO VIOLATE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
I WAS DICKING AROUND IN PRE CALC AND I FOUND SOME WIERD THINGS I FOUND THAT THERE WAS A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE EQUATION OF A GRAPH AND THE SLOPE AT POINTS OF THE GRAPH I BROUGHT THIS NEW SHOCKING INFORMATION TO MY TEACHER WHO INFORMED ME THAT I HAD BASICALLY DISCOVERED THE POWER RULE
MY EXAMPLES HAVE A PATTERN

WITNESS SOMETHING MIND BOGGLING IN MY SETUP OR DATA

THE THRILLING RUSH ENSUES

I THINK ABOUT HOW I'LL REPORT THIS NEW WONDER

RATIONAL THOUGHT BEGINS TO SEEP BACK IN

I'LL EVEN BLUSH IN REALIZATION OF MY FOLLY

THE RELIEF THAT I DIDN'T INFORM THE MEDIA YET ROLLS IN

AND THEN I MARVEL AT HOW PEDICULOUS THE ENTIRE SERIES OF EVENTS WAS AND PROBABLY WILL BE IN THE FUTURE WHEN I DO IT ALL AGAIN

IS THIS WHAT IS MEANT BY THE THRILL OF DISCOVERY


I REMEMBER READING A STORY LONG AGO ABOUT A PROFESSOR TRYING TO BOIL SOME LIQUID TO TEST SOMETHING
THING IS THE LIQUID WAS SOME KIND OF PETROL FUEL
TUNNEL VISION TESTING
CERTAINLY NOT A NOBEL MOMENT BUT I DID GET EXCITED ABOUT SOME RESULTS A BIT TOO EARLY ON ONE OF THE PROJECTS I WAS WORKING ON IN GRAD SCHOOL WAS TO MEASURE EXPANSION OF A SLAB OF ROCK WE BUILT A INTERFEROMETER WITH THE ROCK SLAB AS THE TEST ARM AND PUT SOME PATS ON THE ROCK AFTER CAREFUL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE INTERFEROMETER AND ITS TRANSFER FUNCTION WE MODULATED THE PATS AND LOOKED FOR THE OUTPUT SIGNAL FROM THE INTERFEROMETER TO SHOW EXPANSION CONTRACTION OF THE SLAB WE DEFINITELY SAW A SIGNAL IN OUR DATA AND WITH THE SAME PERIOD AS THE MODULATION SIGNAL AT THIS POINT I WAS GETTING PRETTY EXCITED BUT THE PROFESSOR I WAS WORKING WITH WAS SKEPTICAL HIS EXACT WORDS WERE ONLY THE PARANOID SURVIVE SO WE UNCOUPLED ALL THE PATS FROM THE SLAB AND REPEATED THE EXPERIMENT AND LOW AND BEHOLD THE INTERFEROMETER OUTPUT SHOWED THE SAME MODULATION AS WHEN THEY WERE ATTACHED WE CHECKED EVERYTHING BUT NEVER FIGURED OUT EXACTLY WHY IT HAPPENED IT WAS SOME SORT OF PARASITIC COUPLING IT WASN'T A TOTAL LOSS THOUGH THE INTERFEROMETER HAD A DISPLACEMENT SENSITIVITY OF NM SO AT LEAST WE HAD AN UPPER BOUND NOW
IN HIGH SCHOOL MY DAD PURCHASED ONE OF THOSE SODA MACHINE MAKERS SEVERAL MONTHS LATER I HAD AN EPIPHANY THAT I COULD MAKE CARBONATED COFFEE

FOR THE NEXT MINUTES I WAS GIDDY WITH GLEE AS I IMAGINED ALL THE GLORY MEDIA PRESS AND DELICIOUSNESS OF MY BRILLIANT IDEA HOW COULD THE WORLD BE SO STUPID NOT TO CONCEIVE THIS PRIOR TO ME

TASTES LIKE ASS REALITY DID NOT MATCH UP TO THE DREAM I WAS HUMILIATED BY MY HUBRIS
HOW ABOUT THE DOLLAR EXPERIMENT TO MEASURE NEUTRINOS THAT FOUND NEUTRINOS TRAVELLED FASTER THAN LIGHT GENERATING HUNDREDS OF PAPERS ONLY TO FIND OUT THE CABLE WAS LOOSE

EDIT TO BE CLEAR THE SCIENTISTS INVOLVED WERE VERY HUMBLE IN THEIR REPORTING AND DID NOTHING WRONG IT WAS THE NEWS MEDIA THAT WENT CRAZY
THE NUMBER OF TIME I HAVE MEASURED OVER UNITY POWER BALANCES
CHEATING HERE I'M A CHEMIST BUT I MADE A PHOSPHORUS COMPLEX ONCE IN UNDERGRAD I THOUGHT ACTIVATED CATALYTICALLY WAS ALREADY PLANNING MY NOBEL SPEECH IN MY HEAD WHEN MY SUPERVISOR EXPLAINED THE NMR SPLITTING I SAW WAS THE WRONG COUPLING CONSTANT AND I WAS JUST SEEING PROTON COUPLING

DANG
I DID BOTH THEORY AND EXPERIMENT IN GRAD SCHOOL THERE WAS A HOUR PERIOD WHERE I THOUGHT I HAD SOLVED THE THREE BODY PROBLEM IN QUANTUM MECHANICAL SCATTERING THEORY I DIDN'T I FELT VERY PUFFED UP FOR A COUPLE DAYS
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL I HAD THIS GREAT IDEA THAT TIME MIGHT NOT BE CONSTANT I WAS CERTAIN THAT I WOULD GET THE NOBEL PRIZE SOME DAY FOR THAT

YEARS LATER MY MOMENTS FROM EXPERIMENTS HAVE ALL BEEN REAL BUT NOTHING SO BIG AS TO GET THE NOBEL PRIZE
I'M A BIOLOGIST NOT A PHYSICIST BUT ONCE I FOUND THIS REALLY BIZARRE INVERTEBRATE IN ONE OF MY RESEARCH AQUARIUMS IT WAS IN FRESHWATER BUT LOOKED ABSOLUTELY NOTHING LIKE ANYTHING I'D EVER SEEN IN FRESHWATER ACTUALLY IT LOOKED VAGUELY CLOSER TO SOME MARINE INVERTS WITH NO FRESHWATER REPRESENTATIVES I POPPED IT IN SOME ETHANOL AND WENT AROUND TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT

TURNS OUT IT WAS A FREE-LIVING STAGE OF A FRESHWATER FISH PARASITE JUST ONE THAT I'D NEVER SEEN BEFORE
I HAD AN IDEA A WAYS BACK FOR A NEW INEXPENSIVE METHOD FOR ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING WITH CONDUCTIVE METALS IN A CHARGED ELECTROLYTE BATH USING A LASER TO EXCITE SMALL AREAS TO STIMULATE GROWTH

GO FIGURE I GOT THE POLARITY BACKWARDS IN MY HEAD NEVER WOULD HAVE WORKED
MY FIRST YEAR AS AN UNDERGRAD PHYSICS MAJOR I WAS DESPERATE TO DO RESEARCH SO I WENT TO THIS PROFESSOR WHO IGNORED ME SINCE I WAS A FRESHMAN AND TOLD TO LOOK INTO THIS IDEA WITHOUT ANY DIRECTION OR HELP FROM HIM HE TOLD ME TO TRY TO FIND A LOT OF SUPPORTING DATA AND USE FOR IT WORKED FOR IT FOR MY WHOLE SPRING BREAK TURNS OUT SOMEONE GOT THE PATENT MONTHS BEFORE FOR SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THIS IDEA PROFESSOR DUMPED ME BECAUSE HE THOUGHT I LOOKED INTO THAT BEFORE GATHERING INFORMATIONS
GOOD AND CRUEL LESSON
FEW YEARS AGO IN MY UNDERGRAD YEARS THERE WAS A BIT OF EXCITEMENT AROUND THE AMAP LOW MULTIPOLE MOMENTS DEVIATING FROM THE COSMOLOGICAL MODELS BY SOME DECENT AMOUNT EAST G HERE

ONE OF THE EXPLANATIONS THAT WAS FLOATED WAS THAT THERE MIGHT BE A TOPOLOGY OF THE UNIVERSE IN OTHER WORDS THE UNIVERSE IS MADE OF CELLS AND WHEN YOU EXIT OFF THE WALL OF ONE CELL YOU ENTER THE SAME CELL BUT FROM OPPOSITE DIRECTION LIKE WHEN YOU PLAY SNAKE LEAVE THE SCREEN ON THE RIGHT AND YOU ENTER ON THE LEFT

THESE CELLS COULD BE CUBES DODECAHEDRONS ETC FOR SOME REASON I DON'T RECALL THE DODECAHEDRON WAS LIKELIER THAN OTHERS I WAS GIVEN THE TASK OF CHECKING QUASAR IMAGES FROM THE SLOAN DIGITAL SKY SURVEY TO SEE IF THEY PREFERENTIALLY ALIGN IN CERTAIN DISCRETE ANGLES THIS IS WHAT YOU'D EXPECT BECAUSE THROUGH THESE CELLS YOU SEE THE QUASAR IMAGES ROTATED BY THE SYMMETRY ANGLE OF THE CELL WALL EAST G DEGREES FOR THE CUBES FOR THE DODECAHEDRONS ETC

I DID A QUICK ANALYSIS USING JPEG IMAGES OF QUASARS STACKED THEM TOGETHER AND LOW AND BEHOLD I GET A STAR WITH BRANCHES THAT WAS ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING THING I'VE SEEN IT COULD HAVE BEEN THE PROOF OF THE TOPOLOGY OF SPACE BECAUSE JPEG IMAGES ARE NOT TOP NOTCH I NEEDED TO CONFIRM THIS USING THE ASTRONOMY STANDARD FORMAT AND WHEN I STACKED THE QUASAR IMAGES THE STAR SHAPE DIDN'T SHOW UP I DON'T KNOW THE REASON TO THIS DAY I'M GUESSING SOME JPEG COMPRESSION METHOD INTRODUCED THE ARTIFACT
BIOLOGIST HERE I WAS WORKING WITH DOPAMINERGIC NEURONS INVESTIGATING THE ROLE OF ALPHA SYNUCLEIN INCA AFTER SKIMMING SOME LITERATURE I NOTICED THAT INCA IS LINKED TO ATTENUATION OF DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER AND THAT DOPAMINE METABOLISM RESULTS IN REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES I THOUGHT I HAD JUST COME UP WITH THE MECHANISM BY WHICH DOPAMINERGIC NEURONS DIE IN PARKINSON'S DISEASE THEN I FOUND OUT THAT THIS HAD BEEN FIGURED OUT YEARS AGO
I THINK EVERY KID WHO WAS INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT INVENTED A FREE ENERGY DEVICE WITH MAGNETS IT IS THOSE WHO PERSIST INTO ADULTS
MEASURED A MEISSNER EFFECT IN A ROOM TEMPERATURE LUMP OF DOPED SLAG I WAS FANTASIZING ABOUT WHAT KIND OF HOTEL I WOULD STAY AT IN STOCKHOLM WHEN ONE OF THE LAB TECHS POINTED OUT TO ME THAT A PERMANENT MAGNET FROM A PRIOR EXPERIMENT WAS TAPED UNDER THE APPARATUS
DURING A PROJECT ON ANTI NUCLEI PRODUCTION AT THE CDF I THOUGHT I HAD DISCOVERED ANTI TRITIUM

NO SPECIFIC MISTAKE JUST A PILE OF SHIT CODE
THOUGHT I DISCOVERED A TROJAN PLANET WAS JUST AN ECLIPSING BINARY
I WAS HELPING SOMEONE FROM THE OTHER LAB IN OUR BUILDING ONCE WITH SOME TRANSMISSION MEASUREMENTS AND SHE WAS CONSISTENTLY GETTING MEASUREMENTS I KIDDINGLY SAID IT WAS NOBEL MATERIAL IF SHE HAD SOME MAGICAL GAIN MEDIUM BATTERY BUT SHE WAS VERY CONFIDENT IT WAS A FLUKE I DON'T THINK SHE EVER FOLLOWED UP OR SAW THAT PHENOMENON AGAIN FOR THAT MATTER
NOT REALLY ANY PART OF MY PHYSICS BACKGROUND BUT SHORTLY AFTER LEARNING ABOUT LIGHT FIELD CAMERAS I REALIZED THAT IF YOU COULD CREATE LIGHT FIELD PROJECTORS YOU COULD HAVE 3D MOVIES WITHOUT A SINGLE FOCAL DEPTH WHERE YOU COULD FOCUS ANYWHERE IN THE SCENE

I SPENT THE NEXT THREE HOURS DRAWING OUT AN OPTICAL SETUP FOR SOME AR GLASSES FOR JUST THIS THEN I WAS LIKE HMM I WONDER IF ANYONE HAS PATENTED THIS YET SO I WENT OUT AND LOOKED FOR LIGHT FIELD GLASSES IT WAS THEN THAT I LEARNED ABOUT THE MICROSOFT HOLOLENS WHICH M HAD PATENTED NO MORE THAN A WEEK BEFORE I CAME UP WITH THE IDEA THEIR SETUP WAS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DEVELOPED THAN MY OWN THOUGH AND THEY HAD ALREADY PUT TOGETHER A PROCESSING ARCHITECTURE FOR THE DIGITAL PROJECTION SO THERE WAS NO CHANCE I COULD HAVE COMPETED WITH THEIR PATENT HAD I GOTTEN MINE IN FIRST LOL IT PROBABLY WASN'T EVEN THE FIRST ONE EITHER
THE VERY FIRST TIME YOU SEE A SPECTRUM WHICH LOOKS LIKE YOU MIGHT HAVE PARTICLES MOVING FTL FOR THAT FIRST SPLIT SECOND YOU WONDER A LITTLE BIT ONLY TO END UP LAUGHING AT YOURSELF IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS
I WAS WONDERING WHY CAR MANUFACTURER'S DIDN'T ATTACH A DYNAMO TO THE AXEL OF CARS AND USE IT TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY AND THEN CAR'S COULD RUN PARTIALLY ON ELECTRICITY THEY GENERATED I INVENTED THE HYBRID CAR ENGINE AFTER IT HAD BEEN INVENTED
THEORIST HERE

DURING THE SUMMER AFTER MY FRESHMAN YEAR I THOUGHT I DISCOVERED AN ENERGY CONVERSION CONSTANT FOR HIGH VELOCITY SCENARIOS BUT IT TURNED OUT TO SIMPLY BE A STUPID ALTERNATIVE TO USING A GAMMA FACTOR
THE DOVER REPRINT IS AVAILABLE NEW IN PAPERBACK ON AMAZON FOR THAT'S GOT TO BE CHEAPER THAN THE COST OF PRINTING IT OUT WHY NOT GIVE BOOK READING A TRY
DELETED
AT BEST WE MIGHT SAY THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE THE BIG BANG WHICH IS NOT THE SAME THING AS SAYING THAT NOTHING EXISTED AT WORST IT MIGHT NOT EVEN MAKE SENSE TO ASK ABOUT BEFORE THE BIG BANG BECAUSE OUR NOTION OF TIME ITSELF BREAKS DOWN AT THE BIG BANG

BASICALLY WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE THE BIG BANG AND WE'RE NOT EVEN SURE WHETHER THE QUESTION IS WELL-DEFINED
I WOULD ARGUE THAT THIS IS JUST AS UNJUSTIFIED AS SAYING THAT SOMETHING EXISTED BEFORE THE BB WE SIMPLY JUST DON'T KNOW OUR THEORIES BREAK DOWN AT THE PLANCK ERA AND WE ARE NOT ABLE TO MAKE ANY STATEMENTS THAT ARE BACKED BY OUR SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY NOTHING
THERE ARE PROBLEMS THE BIG BANG IS CONSIDERED THE START OF SPACE-TIME SO THERE'S NO BEFORE IF TIME DIDN'T EXIST AND THERE'S NO NOTHING IF SPACE DIDN'T EXIST LITERALLY NOT EVEN NOTHING

MY CONCEPT ENTIRELY BREAKS DOWN ON THAT I CAN'T CONCEIVE OF IT BUT THAT'S WHAT I THINK THE BIG BANG MEANS THE START OF SPACE-TIME THEREFORE NOT EVEN NOTHING NOT EVEN TIME BEFORE THE BIG BANG LIKE DIVIDING BY ZERO IS UNDEFINED
PERSONALLY I THINK IT WOULD BE INCORRECT OR PREMATURE TO DEFINITELY STATE THAT NOTHING EXISTED BEFORE THE BIG BANG WE CAN'T YET SAY THIS



FOR EXAMPLE

THERE ARE SOME WHO BELIEVE THE CURRENT UNIVERSE IS INFINITE IN SIZE AND THAT OUR BIG BANG WAS JUST A LOCAL INFLATION EVENT WITHIN THAT GREATER INFINITE SPANNING UNIVERSE

THAT MEANS A LOT OF STUFF HAS HAPPENED BEFORE OUR LITTLE INFLATION EVENT AN INFINITY OF TIME EVENTS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE US



OR IN ANOTHER EXAMPLE

SOME SAY THAT OUR BIG BANG CREATED OUR ISOLATED LITTLE UNIVERSE BUBBLE WITHIN A VAST SEA KNOWN AS THE THAT IS SEETHING CONSTANTLY WITH OTHER BUBBLE UNIVERSES POPPING IN AND OUT OF EXISTENCE CONSTANTLY

IF SO THEN IT'S POSSIBLE THE FABRIC OF THE GREATER HAS IT'S OWN ISOLATED SPACE-TIME DIMENSIONS THAT ARE SEPARATE FROM OUR OWN SPACE-TIME DIMENSIONS



STILL OTHERS SAY THAT OUR CURRENT OBSERVABLE UNIVERSE IS THE BOTTOM OR THE INTERIOR OF A BLACK HOLE AND THAT THE BIG BANG WAS THE MOMENT THE BLACK HOLE WAS CREATED

THIS MEANS THERE IS NOW A WALL ISOLATING US FROM THE REST OF THE UNIVERSE SINCE WE CAN'T SEE OUTSIDE THE EVENT HORIZON OF THE BLACK HOLE THAT WE ARE STUCK INSIDE OF

IF TRUE THAT THUS MEANS WE HAVE OUR OWN SPACE-TIME AND THE MAIN PART OF THE UNIVERSE HAS IT'S OWN SPACE-TIME UNFOLDING THAT MAKES US A KIND OF BRANCHING SPACE-TIME MOVING IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION FROM THE MAIN SPACE-TIME

YOU ACCEPT THE BIG BANG THEORY

THEN THERE IS NO SUCH MOMENT IF THIS IS THE CASE THEN THE CORRECTNESS OF YOUR SENTENCE DEVOLVES INTO LOGICAL TRICKERY

SKIP TO THE NEXT SECTION IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT LOGICAL TRICKERY

BEFORE THE BIG BANG REFERS TO A MOMENT WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT EXIST BERTRAND RUSSEL DEALS WITH THIS SORT OF THING IN HIS ANALYSIS OF DEFINITE DESCRIPTIONS WHICH GOES MORE OR LESS LIKE THIS

WHAT WOULD YOU SAY ABOUT THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE

THE PRESENT KING OF FRANCE IS BALD

THERE IS NO PRESENT KING OF FRANCE SO EITHER

THE SENTENCE IS CORRECT VACUOUSLY ALL ZERO KINGS OF FRANCE ARE BALD
THE SENTENCE IS INCORRECT BECAUSE THE THE ASSERTS EXISTENCE WHICH DOESN'T HOLD
THE SENTENCE IS NEITHER CORRECT NOR INCORRECT IN WHICH CASE I GUESS IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO WHAT YOU MEAN BY CORRECT IN THE FIRST PLACE

UNDER THE BIG BANG THEORY THE SAME ANALYSIS APPLIES TO YOUR SENTENCE WHICH I THINK MAKES IT IRRELEVANT FOR R PHYSICS AT ANY RATE

IF YOU REJECT THE BIG BANG THEORY

THEN YOU MIGHT ADMIT THAT WAS A BANG BUT WASN'T THE BIG ONE YOU STILL MIGHT USE THE PHRASE THE BIG BANG TO REFER TO THAT EVENT BUT YOU WOULD BE DOING SO IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT ASSERT THE VALIDITY OF THE THEORY IN THIS CASE I SEE TWO WAYS TO GO

WE COULD ADOPT A THEORY OF TIME THAT DOES NOT HAVE A BEGINNING IN WHICH CASE I GUESS THE EXISTENCE OF OBJECTS BEFORE THE BIG BANG REMAINS AN OPEN QUESTION FOR THE ASTRONOMERS TO SETTLE

WE COULD ADOPT A THEORY OF TIME THAT DOES HAVE A BEGINNING BUT FOR WHICH THE BANG IN QUESTION WAS NOT THAT BEGINNING IN THIS CASE I THINK YOUR ASSERTION WOULD BE INCORRECT IF THE BIG BANG HAPPENED IN TIME THEN AT THE VERY LEAST TIME ITSELF EXISTED BEFORE THE BIG BANG
NOTHING EXISTS NOW
TL ROYAL NO INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE THE BIG BANG SURVIVED THE EVENT
IT'S A DIFFICULT TOPIC TO DISCUSS AS IT REALLY DOESN'T MAKE SENSE

TIME IS A DIMENSION OF OUR UNIVERSE BEFORE THE BIG BANG TIME ITSELF DID NOT EXIST THEREFORE THERE NEVER ACTUALLY WAS A BEFORE THE BIG BANG

IF WE WANT TO CONSIDER A SORT OF TRANSUNIVERSAL TIME HONESTLY JUST TALKING OUT OF MY ASS AT THIS POINT AND I WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO THINK OTHERWISE THEN I SUPPOSE WE COULD CONSIDER THERE TO BE A BEFORE THE BIG BANG WHERE GIVEN OUR CURRENT KNOWLEDGE WE WOULD SUSPECT TO OBSERVE A SINGULARITY AGAIN THOUGH THIS IS JUST SPOUTING OUT OF MY ASS AND REALLY DOESN'T EVEN MAKE MUCH SENSE THERE WOULDN'T BE NOTHING EXACTLY AS WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE THINGS NOW SO THERE AT THE VERY LEAST WOULD HAVE TO BE THE POTENTIAL FOR OUR CURRENT REALITY TO EXIST
THE BIG BANG IS A RIDICULOUS THEORY IN MY OPINION WHY BECAUSE AS MY IMAGINATION WORKS BACKWARDS TOWARDS THE BEGINNING EVERYTHING BECOMES DENSER EVENTUALLY THE DENSITY OF THE WHOLE UNIVERSAL SYSTEM APPROACHES THE DENSITY OF A BLACK HOLE BEFORE IT APPROACHES THE DENSITY OF THE SUPPOSED PRE EXPANSION UNIVERSE OF PLANCK SIZED UNITS NO AT THE POINT OF BLACK HOLE DENSITY THERE ARE NO POSITIVE TIME VALUES LEFT IN THE SYSTEM SO TIME CAN NEVER PROGRESS FORWARD SO HOW DOES THE MATH PROGRESS THE SYSTEM PAST THE BLACK HOLE DENSITY INTO THE POSITIVE TIME VALUES WE SEE TODAY
WE DON'T KNOW I'M NOT EVEN SURE THIS IS A VALID QUESTION TIME STARTED WITH THE BIG BANG SO CAN THERE BE A BEFORE
CANT STATE ANYTHING AT ALL MAYBE YOUR RIGHT BUT YOU CAN ALSO BE WRONG
BEFORE IMPLIES THAT TIME CONTINUED TO EXIST BUT THE BIG BANG WAS THE THE BEGINNING OF TIME SO THERE WAS NO BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF TIME
ALL THE MATH
DON'T FORGET ABOUT NUMERICAL METHODS THOUGH
I WOULD SAY A DECENT GROUNDING IN GROUP THEORY IS ESSENTIAL FOR UNDERSTANDING MOST OF PARTICLE PHYSICS
YOU DON'T NEED PHD IN MATH FOR DOING SOME WORK IN PHYSICS BUT IT CERTAINLY HELPS IF YOU WANT TO PUBLISH AND BE A TOP DOG

FOR MORE INFO YOU CAN READ ABOUT PEOPLE WHO HELPED EINSTEIN WITH MATHEMATICS
SO YOU WANT TO HAVE YOUR EIGHTH GRADERS TACKLE ENGINEERING PROBLEMS THAT TOP TIER ROBOTICS COMPANIES ARE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW HOW MUCH DO THEY KNOW ABOUT BATTERY CHEMISTRY HOW MUCH HAVE THEY STUDIED AERODYNAMICS OR CONTROL SYSTEMS

I LIKE THE GENERAL SENTIMENT OF THE PROJECT BUT THESE DAYS YOU CAN MAKE TWO STICKS TIED TOGETHER INTO A DRONE USING MODERN HOBBYIST COMPONENTS I'D SUGGEST RETHINKING THE PROJECT
THERE HAVE BEEN SCATTERING EXPERIMENTS WITH ELECTRONS THAT REVEAL THERE MUST BE SOME KIND OF SUB STRUCTURE IN PROTONS AND NEUTRONS

WIKI


FIRST WE HAVE OBSERVED BARE QUARKS TOP QUARKS ARE SO UNSTABLE THAT AFTER THEY ARE PRODUCED THEY DECAY BEFORE THEY BIND UP WITH OTHER QUARKS SO EVERY TIME WE OBSERVE A TOP QUARK DECAY WE OBSERVE A BARE QUARK

SECOND THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO SEE THAT A PROTON IS A COMPOSITE PARTICLE THAN TO BREAK IT APART INTO QUARKS WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE PROBABLY THE EASIEST ONE TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT THERE ARE PATTERNS IN THE PROPERTIES OF MESONS AND BARYONS MESONS ARE PARTICLES MADE OF A QUARK AND ANTIQUARY PAIR BARYONS ARE PARTICLES MADE OF THREE QUARKS THE PATTERNS ARE ANALOGOUS TO THE PATTERNS OF THE PERIODIC TABLE OF ELEMENTS

IN THE PERIODIC TABLE THESE PATTERNS ARE EXPLAINED BY SAYING THAT ATOMS ARE MADE OF AND THAT PATTERNS IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF MANIFEST AS PATTERNS IN THE PROPERTIES OF ELEMENTS LIKEWISE PATTERNS IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF QUARKS MANIFEST AS PATTERNS IN THE PROPERTIES OF MESONS AND BARYONS
VERY SIMPLY PUT IF A PROTON HAS A SUBSTRUCTURE OF CHARGED PARTICLES CERTAIN COLLISION EXPERIMENTS THAT INVOLVE ELEMENTARY PARTICLE INTERACTIONS PREDICT DIFFERENT OUTCOMES THAN IF IT HAD NO SUBSTRUCTURE THIS HAS BEEN MEASURED
CD THE THEORY THAT DESCRIBES QUARKS AND GLUONS CORRECTLY DESCRIBES THINGS LIKE NUCLEAR DECAYS AND THE STRONG FORCE IN GENERAL SO THE FACT THAT WE CAN MAKE CONCLUSIONS FROM THIS MODEL AND TEST ITS VALIDITY BY OBSERVING ITS CONSEQUENCES IS EVIDENCE THAT THERE'S SOMETHING TO IT WHETHER IT'S REAL OR NOT DOESN'T MATTER FOR PHYSICS FOR PHYSICS IT ONLY MATTERS THAT IT ACCURATELY MODELS REALITY

I HAVEN'T DONE THE MATH BUT I THINK YOUR THEORY THAT THEY ARE JUST INDIVIDABLE PARTICLES DOESN'T MODEL RADIOACTIVE DECAYS WELL
WHAT DOES REAL MEAN UNTIL YOU WORK THAT PART OUT YOU'VE GOT SOME SHIFTING GOALPOSTS IN YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE NATURE OF QUARKS

IT IS PRETTY CONCLUSIVELY DEMONSTRATED THAT PROTONS AND NEUTRONS ARE NOT SIMPLE PARTICLES FOR EXAMPLE THE NEUTRON HAS A MAGNETIC MOMENT AND LOTS OF EXPERIMENTS SMASHING PROTONS AND NEUTRONS TOGETHER HAVE PRODUCED INTERESTING RESULTS
THIS STORY WAS ALL OVER THE NEWS A FEW YEARS AGO WIKIPEDIA MENTIONS IT WITH THESE REFERENCES

PAPER
REFUTATION

THE SOLAR NEUTRINO HYPOTHESIS IS APPARENTLY DEBUNKED INCLUDING BY ANALYSIS OF NUCLEAR DECAY IN THERMOELECTRIC GENERATORS OUTSIDE OF EARTH ORBIT

BUT THERE ARE ACTUALLY NUCLEAR DECAY PROCESSES SUCH AS ELECTRON CAPTURE WHERE THE RATE IS AFFECTED BY ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THIS STANDS HIGH ON MY LIST OF THINGS I DIDN'T LEARN IN SCHOOL WHICH REALLY SHOCKED ME YEARS LATER

IF THIS APPARENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FLARES AND DECAY RATES PROVES TRUE IT COULD LEAD TO A METHOD OF PREDICTING SOLAR FLARES PRIOR TO THEIR OCCURRENCE

NO SUCH PREDICTION HAPPENED OBVIOUS CASE THE SCIENTISTS DON'T UNDERSTAND THEIR EXPERIMENTS

WHILE NEUTRINOS CAN INDUCE BETA DECAYS THE RATE IS USUALLY NEGLIGIBLE AND SOLAR FLARES HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH NEUTRINOS
I GUESS THAT ARE SAYING NEUTRINOS ARE INFLUENCING DECAY RATES IN A MEASURABLE WAY IT ALL DEPENDS HOW MUCH
WELL I'VE HEARD OF SUPERRADIANCE POWER LAW DECAY RATHER THAN EXPONENTIAL NOT SURE IF THAT RELATES TO THIS ARTICLE
EVERY JACKSON PROBLEM
I FORGET WHAT THE QUESTION WAS BUT FOR A TAKE HOME FINAL IN FOURIER ANALYSIS THE PROFESSOR ASSIGNED AN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT PROOF I THOUGHT I HAD THE SOLUTION BUT THEN REALIZED I MADE AN ERROR AND THE SOLUTION WASN'T VALID I KEPT TRYING TO SOLVE IT BUT ATTEMPT AFTER ATTEMPT LED NOWHERE THE OTHER STUDENT FARED SIMILARLY AND NOT EVEN ONE STUDENT IN THE CLASS MANAGED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM

SINCE WE HAD A TAKE HOME FINAL INSTEAD OF AN ACTUAL FINAL WE HAD A FINAL LECTURE ON WHICH WE WOULD TURN IN THE TAKE HOME FINAL AND THE PROFESSOR WOULD GO OVER THE SOLUTIONS WE ALL TURN IT IN AND ASK HIM HOW TO DO THE PROBLEM HE STARTS COPYING HIS SOLUTIONS DOING IT IN THE SAME WAY MOST OF US HAD GETS TO THE POINT WHERE WE HAD MADE THE MISTAKE HE THEN STARTS TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE BUT CATCHES HIMSELF HE THEN STARES AT IT FOR A WHILE LONGER BEFORE APOLOGIZING AND SAYING THAT IT HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IF IT WAS POSSIBLE TO PROVE

TL R PROFESSOR ACCIDENTALLY ASSIGNED A PROBLEM WHICH MIGHT NOT EVEN HAVE HAD A SOLUTION
A SPHERE WITH A HOLLOW CAVITY WHERE THE OUTSIDE SURFACE IS AT ONE TEMPERATURE AND THE INSIDE SURFACE HAS TWO HEMISPHERES EACH AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES FIND THE TEMPERATURE EVERYWHERE IN THE SHELL
A TAYLOR EXPANSION NOT SURE WHAT FUNCTION IT WAS I SPEND DAYS ON IT USING EVERY MATHEMATICAL TOOL I HAD LEARNT AFTER A WEEK OF DAILY STRUGGLE I MANAGE TO SOLVE IT JUST IN TIME FOR THE HOMEWORK DEADLINE

I HAND IN AROUND TEN PAGES OF HOMEWORK FIVE BEING A DERIVATION OF THE COEFFICIENTS IN CLOSED FORM I ASK MY TUTOR WHETHER I MISSED SOMETHING OBVIOUS THIS PROBLEM WAS SO MUCH HARDER THAN ALL THE OTHER ONES IN THE PROBLEM SET

YOU KNOW YOU ONLY NEEDED TO CALCULATE THE FIRST TWO COEFFICIENTS RIGHT
WELL I'D SUGGEST TO LOOK AT THE FARADAY EFFECT FARADAY ROTATION BUT IT IS A KNOWN PHENOMENON AND APPARENTLY THEY ARE WANTING NEW RESEARCH WHAT DO THEY EXPECT YOU TO GET A NOBEL PRIZE TOO I ASSUME YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT ALL THIS WITH YOUR PHYSICS TEACHER AS WELL THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO POINT YOU IN SOME INTERESTING DIRECTIONS OR CONNECT YOU WITH PROFESSORS AT A LOCAL UNIVERSITY
HOW DOES TEMPERATURE AFFECT THE CURVE OF A DIODE
YOUR FIRST COUPLE YEARS WILL BE MOSTLY GENERAL ED COURSES MATH SEQUENCES CALCULUS AND INTRO PHYSICS TAKE THIS TIME TO GET INTO GOOD STUDY HABITS AND BUILD A NICE GA READ YOUR PHYSICS PROFESSORS WEBPAGES AND FIND THINGS THAT INTEREST YOU REACH OUT TO THEM TO SEE IF THERE IS ANYTHING YOU CAN DO AS AN UNDERGRAD RESEARCHER THIS FACETIAE IS IMPORTANT WHEN THE TIME COMES FOR LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION

I'D ALSO CONSIDER TAKING SOME COURSES IN PROGRAMMING THAT IS FROM THE COMPUTER SCIENCE DEPT ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING ETC TO HELP GET SOME SKILLS THAT CAN HELP YOU LAND A FIRST JOB AND HELP IN THE LAB ALSO IF YOU CAN INVOLVED IN ENGINEERING PROJECTS SOLAR CAR ETC THAT WILL GET YOU SOME PROJECT EXPERIENCE CAREERS WITH JUST A BS IN PHYSICS ARE CHALLENGING TO FIND BECAUSE THEY WILL OFTEN BE COMPETING WITH ENGINEERS

IF YOU WANT TO WORK IN PHYSICS A PHD IS BASICALLY A REQUIREMENT BUT YOU CAN BE IN ACADEMIA OPEN POSITIONS ARE SPARSE OR INDUSTRY
DO YOU WISH TO GO INTO PHYSICS FOR THE PURE JOY AND LOVE OF PHYSICS ITSELF IN WHICH YOU FIND YOURSELF OFTEN OBSESSIVELY THINKING ABOUT PHYSICS PROBLEMS IN YOUR HEAD

IF SO THEN CERTAINLY MAJORING IN PHYSICS IS PROBABLY FOR YOU

BUT YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO REACH THE PHD LEVEL TO MAKE A GOOD CAREER OF IT

AND IN REACHING THE PHD LEVEL IDEALLY AND REALISTICALLY YOUR MEASURED IQ WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO BE WELL ABOVE AVERAGE BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SKY-HIGH AND SUPER GENIUS LEVEL IQ ISN'T NECESSARY TO SUCCEED IN PHYSICS



THERE ARE HOWEVER SOME OCCUPATIONS RELATED TO PHYSICS IN WHICH YOU DON'T HAVE TO REACH THE PHD LEVEL

SUCH AS SCIENCE JOURNALIST I ALSO KNOW SOMEONE WHO HELPS DESIGN RELATED DEVICES AND IMPLANTS AND HE DID HIS BACHELOR'S IN PHYSICS

SO I'M SURE THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE MAKING A LIVING WITH ONLY A BACHELOR'S MASTER'S IN PHYSICS IN A FIELD THAT IS RELATED TO PHYSICS

IF YOU DO SOME GOOGLING YOU'LL PROBABLY BE ABLE TO FIND THEM TO GET IDEAS



FINALLY IF YOU WANT TO MAJOR IN PHYSICS SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU WANT TO WORK IN FIELDS RELATED TO THE SCIENCES THEN ANOTHER OPTION IS A DEGREE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE

I'VE HEARD THAT MANY TEAMS ARE DESPERATE FOR COMPUTER EXPERTS TO HELP THEM PROGRAM DESIGN SIMULATIONS OR ADVANCED DATABASE ANALYSIS OF EXTENSIVE AMOUNTS OF EXPERIMENTAL DATA ETC

JUST A BACHELOR'S IN COMPUTER SCIENCE IS OFTEN ENOUGH TO GET YOU WORKING WITH THOSE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH TEAMS

AND IF YOU WANT TO MAJOR IN PHYSICS BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE AN ASTRONAUT THEN THERE ARE ALSO OTHER ALTERNATIVE PATHWAYS TO THAT CAREER TO EXPLORE AS WELL RELATED TO ENGINEERING AND MEDICINE IF THOSE FIELDS INTEREST YOU MORE



BUT YES IF IT'S JUST THE PURE JOY OF PHYSICS YOU LOVE AND OBSESS ABOUT THEN YOU'LL LIKELY HAVE THE MOTIVATION TO GO ALL THE WAY TO THE PHD LEVEL AND DO WELL

EUROPEAN HERE SO IT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT IN THE US BUT
EXPECT IT TO BE A LOT MORE MATHEMATICAL THAN IN HIGH SCHOOL WE BARELY TOUCHED INTEGRALS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND SUDDENLY DIFFERENTIATION AND INTEGRATION IS EVERYWHERE EVEN IN THE SIMPLEST DYNAMICS PROBLEMS BUT ONCE YOU GET USED TO USING CALCULUS YOU WILL BE AMAZED HOW SIMPLE STUFF GETS I REMEMBER IN HIGH SCHOOL WE HAD ALL THOSE EQUATIONS FOR SPEED ACCELERATION THAT YOU HAD TO KNOW BY HEART AND LIKE TWO MONTHS INTO UNIVERSITY IT WAS LIKE WAIT I CAN JUST DERIVE ALL THAT STUFF USING CALCULUS AND F MA SWEET

ALL TOGETHER FOR ME A BIG PART OF TRANSITION FROM HIGH SCHOOL TO UNI WAS CHANGING THE WAY YOU APPROACH A PROBLEM FROM HERE IS A PROBLEM WHAT EQUATION CAN I USE AND PLUG IN THE NUMBERS TO MOSTLY FIRST YEAR MECHANICS DYNAMICS WHAT IS THE SIMPLEST WAY TO TAKE A PROBLEM APART TO SMALLEST POSSIBLE PIECES AND SOLVE IT GENERAL
MATHEMATICS LOTS OF MATHEMATICS YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL LIKE YOU'RE IN A MATH COURSE THAT JUST HAS A PHYSICS THEME TO IT ONCE YOU HAVE FINISHED YOUR DEGREE YOU WILL BE BETTER AT MATH THAN MOST OF THE MATH MAJORS

IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE DIFFICULT PARTLY BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING FROM HIGH SCHOOL TO COLLEGE WHICH IS ALREADY A ROUGH TRANSITION FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE AND PARTLY BECAUSE PHYSICS IS DIFFERENT FROM MOST OTHER SUBJECTS WHICH CREATES A STEEP LEARNING CURVE EARLY ON AND PARTLY BECAUSE INTRO PHYSICS COVERS A LOT OF DIFFERENT TOPICS FROM MOTION TO CIRCUITS TO HEAT TRANSFER TO MOMENTS OF INERTIA IN THAT WAY INTRO PHYSICS IS ACTUALLY MORE DIFFICULT THAN HIGHER LEVEL CLASSES WHERE YOU GET TO FOCUS ON ONE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPT THE ENTIRE SEMESTER
USE THE FIRST FEW YEARS TO GET REALLY GOOD AT PHYSICS AND MATH UNTIL SOLVING NOVEL PROBLEMS COMES EASILY TO YOU SIT IN THE FRONT OF CLASS AND MAKE EYE CONTACT WITH THE PROFESSOR AND USE THEIR OFFICE HOURS JOIN CLUBS BUILD THINGS WITH THE CLUBS WORK ON PROJECTS ON YOUR OWN TIME USE YOUR PROJECTS AND YOUR LETTERS OF ECC TO GET INTO INTERNSHIPS OR LABS GET REALLY GOOD GRADES IF YOU DO THESE THINGS YOU CAN GET A CAREER IN PHYSICS HOPEFULLY BUT IT LIKELY WON'T BE SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU EXPECT RIGHT NOW JUST DON'T EXPECT TO GET A DEGREE AND INSTANTLY HAVE GOOD PROSPECTS
JUST ABOUT TO FINISH MY FIRST SEMESTER ONLY THE EXAMS TO GO PHYSICS CLASS IS MAINLY SOLVING PROBLEMS MAKE SURE YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH YOUR ALGEBRA AND WORK ON YOUR CALCULUS AND YOU SHOULD BE COVERED BEST ADVICE I CAN GIVE FROM MY CURRENT STAGE ALBEIT NOT A DEEP ONE IS TO SOLVE PROBLEMS AND LOTS OF THEM GRAB A TEXTBOOK AND DIVE IN HOPE THIS HELPS

IT IS A MIXTURE OF STATISTICS AND PHYSICS
I USED TO READ THIS ONE A LOT HAVEN'T IN A WHILE HETP

ALSO THIS ONE BUT SHE HASN'T POSTED IN A WHILE

THE IDEA BEHIND PULSAR NAVIGATION HAS BEEN AROUND FOR QUITE A WHILE AND IS SUPPOSEDLY VERY ACCURATE WITHIN KM ANYWHERE IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND HYPOTHETICALLY JUST AS ACCURATE BEYOND THAT

THE ACTUAL CONCEPT IS FUNDAMENTALLY IDENTICAL TO LIGHTHOUSES YOU SEE A REFERENCE PULSAR FLASHING AT A CERTAIN RATE CHECK YOUR DATABASE TO IDENTIFY WHICH ONE IT IS REPEAT AND BASED ON THE ANGLES TO MULTIPLE REFERENCE STARS YOU CAN NAIL DOWN YOUR APPROXIMATE LOCATION PULSARS ARE GREAT FOR THIS BECAUSE WHILE NORMAL STARS CAN BE EXTREMELY SIMILAR THE CHANCE OF TWO PULSARS HAVING IDENTICAL SPIN RATES IS EFFECTIVELY AND COUNTING HOW FAST SOMETHING FLASHES IS WAY EASIER THAN DOING A THOROUGH MEASUREMENT ON THINGS LIKE MAGNITUDE OR METALLICITY

SIGNIFICANT VICTORY PROBABLY NOT CHINA HASN'T PUT ANYTHING UP THAT HAS REQUIRED THAT KIND OF DEEP SPACE LOCATION ACCURACY YET ACCURACY FROM POSITIONING IS WITHIN ABOUT PER AU DISTANT AND NASA IS PLANNING ON DOING A SIMILAR EXPERIMENT USING THE NICER INSTRUMENT THEY ARE LAUNCHING TO THE ISS IN THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO CRS RESUPPLY MISSION WHENEVER THAT COMES AROUND

EDIT CLARIFICATION ON THE PULSAR TIMING THEY MEASURE THE PULSE RATE OF A KNOWN PULSAR COMPARE TO A FIXED DATABASE EARTH AND CAN THEN CALCULATE POSITION FROM MULTIPLE REFERENCE STARS BASED ON THE SLIGHT CHANGE IN TIMING LIKE GPS OR EARTHQUAKES
IF YOU'D LIKE TO READ AN IN DEPTH PAPER ON HOW NAVIGATING WITH PULSARS IS DONE HERE IS ONE

I DON'T SEE TOO MANY OF THESE POSTS AND NOTICE THEM MAYBE DAY OR SO I AGREE IT DISTRACTS FROM SERIOUS CONVERSATIONS ABOUT CUTTING EDGE WORK BUT SOMETIMES I PICK UP GOOD INFORMATION ABOUT FIELDS I AM NOT CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN ADDITIONALLY NEW PEDAGOGICAL LITERATURE MAY BE WORTH NOTING AND SO IT MIGHT BE GOOD TO HAVE THE REFERENCE IN THIS SUB I'M NO MOD HERE BUT IT'S JUST MY
BANNING THOSE QUESTIONS WON'T MAKE MORE PHYSICS DISCUSSION APPEAR
WE'RE REALLY NOT AT THE POINT WHERE THERE ARE SO MANY POSTS THAT WE NEED TO CURTAIL THE SLIGHTLY REPETITIVE ONES BUT I ENCOURAGE YOU TO POST LINKS THAT YOU FIND INTERESTING SO THAT THE QUESTION THREADS WON'T SEEM AS PROMINENT
MAYBE WE SHOULD CATEGORIZE THEM INSTEAD I DONT SEE A PROBLEM
WEEKLY THREAD

WEEKLY WHAT TO READ THREAD
I AGREE THESE CAN BE ANNOYING ESPECIALLY AS WE MOSTLY GET THE SAME QUESTIONS OVER AND OVER AGAIN BUT I THINK AS LONG AS THEY'RE THE MINORITY WE SHOULD LET SOME OF THEM SLIDE ITS AN INVALUABLE RESOURCE FOR LAYMEN PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS TRY AND IMAGINE YOURSELF IN THEIR POSITIONS
YEAH I DON'T SEE IT AS A PROBLEM ESPECIALLY BECAUSE LIKE ME MANY PEOPLE FEEL LOST AND OVERWHELMED BY THE ENORMOUS SCOPE OF PHYSICS CAREERS AS LONG AS IT'S NOT TOO MANY I DON'T SEE IT AS AN ISSUE CONSIDERING HOW HELPFUL IT IS TO PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO NEED TO REACH OUT TO PROFESSIONALS
THAT'S AMAZING I ALWAYS ASSUMED THE CILIA WAS USED FOR MOVEMENT ONLY
YES A HOLE CAN BE TREATED LIKE A PARTICLE JUST WITH POSITIVE IS SIMILAR TO POSITRONS IN PARTICLE PHYSICS WHICH CAN BE INTERPRETED AS HOLES IN THE DIRAC SEA THE MASS WILL BE THE NEGATIVE OF THE BAND MASS OF THE VALENCE BAND SO IT'S POSITIVE
CAN YOU CLARIFY WHAT YOU MEAN BY HOLE
I'VE BEEN QUANTUM MECHANICS AT THE GRADUATE LEVEL USING PRINCIPLES OF QUANTUM MECHANICS AND IT'S SIMPLY THE PERFECT BOOK FOR SELF STUDY HAVING ONLY UNDERGRAD QM BACKGROUND WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND
I JUST FINISHED SCHOOL AND I HAVE YEAR OF FREE TIME BEFORE GOING TO UNIVERSITY STUDYING PHYSICS WHAT BOOKS WOULD YOU RECOMMEND TO PREPARE FOR UNIVERSITY
AS AN UNDERGRAD WHO HAS TAKEN PHYSICS AND 2 TYPE CLASSES WHAT RESOURCES DO YOU RECOMMEND FOR RELEARNING EVERYTHING IN THOSE TWO CLASSES I HAD A REALLY BAD START IN BOTH OF THEM ESPECIALLY WITH VECTORS AND SECOND LAW I AM MOVING ONTO INTERMEDIATE PHYSICS NEXT SEMESTER AND ALTHOUGH IT USES CALCULUS I WANT TO BE ABLE TO GO INTO THE CLASS WITH CONFIDENCE AND NOT BE AFRAID OF NEEDING TO GO BACK TO PRIOR KNOWLEDGE ANY TEXT BOOKS OR WEBSITES THAT COULD MAINLY TEACH ME SECONDS LAW VECTORS FORCES ELECTRIC CURRENTS AND MAGNETISM THAT YOU GUYS RECOMMEND
BEST GR TEXTBOOK FOR THE ADVANCED UNDERGRAD LEVEL I HAVE TAKEN PDES AND LINEAR AS WELL AS ALL THE CORE PHYSICS CLASSES I'VE LOOKED INTO SEAN BOOK AND BERNARD TEXT BUT DON'T KNOW WHICH IS BEST FOR ME

EDIT I'M DOING THIS AS AN INDUSTRY STUDY SINCE THE ONLY ASTRONOMY PROFESSOR AT MY SCHOOL IS ON SABBATICAL
I'M CURRENTLY WORKING TOWARDS MY DOCTORATE IN MATHEMATICS KNOWING VERY LITTLE ABOUT PHYSICS ONLY BASIC NEWTONIAN AND ELECTRODYNAMICS I'M LOOKING FOR SOME TEXTBOOKS GEARED TOWARDS MATHEMATICIANS TO STUDY IN MY FREE TIME THAT BEING SAID PHYSICS FOR MATHEMATICIANS SEEMS ENTICING CAN ANYONE GIVE ME ANY INSIGHTS INTO THE BOOK OR RECOMMEND SOME OTHERS
DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS ON WHAT WOULD BE A LOGICAL SEQUENCE OF TOPICS AND BOOKS TO STUDY TO GET FROM UNDERGRADUATE QUANTUM MECHANICS TO ADVANCED TOPICS IN QUANTUM MECHANICS LIKE QED AND AFT I'M ALSO DOING A MATH DEGREE AND HAVE A LOT OF EXPOSURE TO LINEAR ALGEBRA AND GEOMETRY

THE CLASS I TOOK COVERED THE FIRST FIVE CHAPTERS OF GRIFFITHS QM SHOULD I JUST PROGRESS FROM THERE INTO PERTURBATION THEORY THE FOLLOWING CHAPTER IS THAT NECESSARY FOR RELATIVISTIC QM
SO YOU'RE A HIGHSCHOOL STUDENT RIGHT NOW IF YOU ARE WONDERING IF YOU'RE LACKING THE MATH KNOWLEDGE FOR PHYSICS THEN PICK A STANDARD PHYSICS TEXTBOOK ANYTHING WITH INTRODUCTION TO SHOULD DO AND GO THROUGH THE FIRST COUPLE CHAPTERS ARE YOU FINDING THE DERIVATIONS CONFUSING AND THE APPLIED MATH MAKES NO SENSE THEN YOU PROBABLY NEED TO KEEP ON WORKING ON YOUR MATHEMATICS

IT'S SOMETHING I DO WHENEVER I'M WONDERING IF I'M READY TO TACKLE SOMETHING NEW I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY BUT WORKS FOR ME
I WOULD TRY AND LEARN CALCULUS THROUGH KHAN ACADEMY VIDEOS AND FREE TEXTBOOKS USE CALCULUS IN DOING BASIC MECHANICS PROBLEMS CAN YOU INTEGRATE ANY ACCELERATION FUNCTION TO GET A VELOCITY FUNCTION CAN YOU INTEGRATE TO FIND THE ROTATIONAL INERTIA OF WEIRD OBJECTS CAN YOU INTEGRATE LAW OF COOLING TO GET TEMPERATURE AS FUNCTION OF TIME IF YOU CAN DO MECHANICS ELECTROMAGNETISM AND THERMO PROBLEMS WITH CALCULUS AS A HIGHSCHOOLER WITHOUT PROPER SCHOOLING THEN THAT IS IMPRESSIVE I HAVE A LOT MORE SCHOOLING THAN YOU I'M A SOPHOMORE IN COLLEGE AND I CAN'T DO THE MATH IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS BOOKS
IS IS THIS REAL DID SOMEONE DO THIS TO SOLVE AN ACTUAL PROBLEM
I'M AMAZED BY THE KIND OF STUFF THAT GETS IMPLEMENTED SINCERELY IN EXCEL

I I HOW THE FUCK DO I ONLY HAVE ONE PAPER PUBLISHED I COULD EASILY PUBLISH ONE PAPER EVERY TWO DAYS IF THIS COUNTS AS SOMETHING WORTH PUBLISHING
RELEVANT XKCD
MY HIGH SCHOOL PHYSICS TEACHER HAD US NAIVELY SOLVE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS USING EXCEL

WHEN I SAY NAIVELY I MEAN NOT REALLY SOLVING BUT KIND OF SIMULATING SOMETHING ALMOST SIMILAR

WE'D CREATE A ROOM WITH COOLING ELEMENTS ON THE SIDES AT FIXED TEMPERATURES THE CELLS INSIDE THE ROOM WOULD HAVE THEIR TEMPERATURE DETERMINED BY THE CELLS AROUND IT THEN YOU COULD USE THE TIME STEP FUNCTION IN EXCEL TO LET IT EVOLVE

THEN WE ADDED DOORS AND SAW HOW THAT WOULD HEAT UP THE ROOM ETC

NOT ACTUALLY SOLVING THE EQUATIONS BUT STILL KIND OF COOL
I JUST WANT TO SEE SOME FIGURES AND THE SPREADSHEET
WHAT INTERESTS ME ABOUT THIS IS WHAT SPECIFIC USE HE MADE OF SBA VISUAL BASIC FOR APPLICATIONS CODE AND WHETHER OR NOT HE NEEDED TO USE CALLS TO EXTERNAL ALLS WRITTEN FOR EXAMPLE IN C OR C THIS APP IS UNDOUBTEDLY NOT JUST USING THE BUILT-IN EXCEL FUNCTIONS OR SOLVER FEATURE I COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING ABOUT THAT AT THE IEEE LINK THOUGH AND NOT ABOUT TO PAY UP FOR A CURIOSITY QUESTION

THOUGH EXCEL IS APPARENTLY A BIG DOWNSIDE IS IT'S IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO CUSTOM PROGRAMMING WHY NOT DO IT USING A MORE TOOL

I'M A PROGRAMMER AND EVEN I SOMETIMES DO DATA MANIPULATION IN ENCELL JUST BECAUSE OF HOW EASY IT IS TO REARRANGE COLUMNS
WHILE EARNING MY EE DEGREE AT ARIZONA STATE IN MY ELECTROMAGNETICS PROFESSOR MR DIAS ACCOMPLISHED THIS IT THEN BECAME A HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT FOR US TO GENERATE PLOTS IN EXCEL FOR DIFFERENT PHYSICAL CONFIGURATIONS ALL SATISFYING EQUATIONS
HARD TO SAY BECAUSE IT'S NOT CLEAR EXACTLY WHAT YOUR BACKGROUND IS STUDYING SPECIAL RELATIVITY IMPLIES YOU'VE ALREADY LEARNED THE BASICS OF CLASSICAL MECHANICS KINEMATICS LAWS MOMENTUM CONSERVATION TYPE STUFF IF THAT'S TRUE THE NEXT STEP TRADITIONALLY IS TO LEARN SOME ELECTROMAGNETISM AND THE PHYSICS OF WAVES

IN GENERAL YOU CAN LOOK UP YOUR LOCAL UNIVERSITY'S ASTROPHYSICS PROGRAM AND FOLLOW THEIR TRACK
CAN I GUESS WHO YOUR FAVORITE MUSICIAN IS IS IT BRIAN MAY

ANYWAYS ASTROPHYSICS IS A PRETTY HIGH-LEVEL FIELD IF NOTHING ELSE YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO KNOW A LOT OF MATH IF YOU WANT TO STUDY IT BEYOND WHAT THE LAYMAN CAN UNDERSTAND

BUT STARTING OUT I'D RECOMMEND STEPHEN SERIES SUCH AS A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO A UNIVERSITY AND JUST WANT TO DO IT ON YOUR OWN YOU COULD ALWAYS GO FOR MIT OPEN COURSEWARE ALL OF THEIR CLASSES THAT ARE OFFERED AT THE SCHOOL ARE ONLINE THERE LECTURES INCLUDED AFTER JUST CHECKING THEY HAVE GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE COURSES CHECK ON THEIR WEBSITE AND FIND OUT WHAT YOU ARE REQUIRED TO TAKE AT MIT FOR THE ASTROPHYSICS MAJOR THEN GO THROUGH ALL OF IT ON THEIR WEBSITE

IS THE WEBSITE I BELIEVE LOTS OF FREE RESOURCES TOO
YOU COULD TRY THIS

IT DOESN'T USE MUCH MATHEMATICS

I DIDN'T STUDY ASTROPHYSICS MYSELF BUT IN GENERAL IN PHYSICS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO DO PROBLEMS YALE ALSO HAS A BASIC PHYSICS COURSE WITH PROBLEM SETS SAME WEBSITE AS THE ONE I LINKED TO HOWEVER IT'S MUCH MORE MATHEMATICALLY INVOLVED IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GO DEEP YOU NEED COLLEGE LEVEL CALCULUS AND LINEAR ALGEBRA MIT OPEN COURSEWARE HAS COURSES FOR BOTH

YOU CAN CHECK OUT COSMIC PERSPECTIVE AS TEXT BOOK I STUMBLED UPON IT LAST YEAR WHEN I WAS SEARCHING FOR FUNDAMENTALS OF PHYSICS AY MY UNIVERSITY LIBRARY BOTH TEXT BOOKS COVER BASICS AND THEY DO VERY GOOD JOB BOOKS ARE VERY THICK BUT MOST OF IT IS TEXT BASED AND YOU CAN ALMOST READ THROUGH THEM LIKE NOVELS THEY ARE ARE THAT WELL WRITTEN
HEY IT'S REALLY GREAT TO SEE YOUR INTEREST AND PASSION FOR

I'VE HAD A STRONG INTEREST IN SCIENCE ASTRONOMY AND ALL THINGS SPACE RELATED SINCE I WAS A KID ESPECIALLY AFTER MY DAD HAD TAKEN ME TO SEE THE FIRST LAUNCH OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE IN



BUT YA ONE SOURCE YOU MAY GREATLY ENJOY TO GET UP TO SPEED ON MANY ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS RELATED TOPICS IS THE PODCAST CALLED

ASTRONOMYCAST

IT'S HOSTED BY DR PAMELA SHE HAS A PHD IN ASTRONOMY AND HAS DONE EXTENSIVE RESEARCH WITH MANY OF THE WORLD'S GREAT TELESCOPES AND SHE'S ALSO AWESOME AT EXPLAINING COMPLEX FUNDAMENTAL TOPICS IN AN EASY TO UNDERSTAND WAY

THE EARLIER SHOWS DISCUSS THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL TOPICS SO YOU CAN ALWAYS DO A MIX OF WATCHING THE MOST RECENT SHOW WHILE ALSO WORKING YOUR WAY FROM THE FIRST SHOW FORWARD GRADUALLY



ASTRONOMY CAST IS ALSO BY FRASER CAIN AND HE HAS ANOTHER AMAZING SHOW CALLED THE WEEKLY SPACE HANGOUT THAT YOU CAN WATCH ON HIS CHANNEL

THE WEEKLY SPACE HANGOUT WILL OFTEN INTERVIEW NASA ASTRONOMERS AND THEN AFTER THE INTERVIEW HIM AND THE OTHER COHOSTS WHO INCLUDE PHD LEVEL STUDENTS IN ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS WILL OFTEN DISCUSS THE MOST EXCITING ASTRONOMY NEWS ETC

SOMETIMES THE INTERVIEWS CAN GET A LITTLE BIT BORING SO SOMETIMES I SKIP AHEAD THROUGH THE INTERVIEW TO THE DISCUSSION PART OF THE SHOW WHICH IS MY FAVORITE PART

I FOUND THIS ONE AND I HAVEN'T STARTED IT YET BUT I'VE HEARD ITS A GOOD ONE AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO START IT AS SOON AS I GET TIME TO DO SO SOMEONE GAVE ME THIS FOR MATH SUPPORT ALSO HOPE I HELPED
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN COSMOLOGY I WOULD CHECK OUT BARBARA INTRODUCTION TO COSMOLOGY IT'S WRITTEN AT A VERY ACCESSIBLE LEVEL AND DOESN'T ASSUME ANY MORE BACKGROUND THAN FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS INCLUDES SOME VERY NICE AND INTUITIVE DESCRIPTIONS OF PHYSICAL PHENOMENA AND EXPLAINS THE BACKGROUND BEHIND EVERY DISCOVERY
RECOMMENDATION DON'T THINK ABOUT WHO READS IT IF YOU DO YOU'LL NEVER GET ANYWHERE WITH THE PROJECT ACTUALLY ONE OF THE VERY GOOD USES OF A BLOG IS RECORDING THINGS THAT FIND USEFUL FOR FUTURE REFERENCE

RECOMMENDATION 2 MAKE SURE YOU CAN INCLUDE MATH PROBABLY BY INCORPORATING MATHJAX INTO THE SITE THERE ARE MATHJAX PLUGGING FOR SOME OF THE BIG BLOGGING SERVICES INCLUDING WORDPRESS

AFTER CONSIDERING THAT JUST SIGN UP SOMEWHERE AND START WRITING
IT'S UP TO YOU TO DECIDE WHO YOU INTEND YOUR AUDIENCE TO BE AND YOUR AUDIENCE COULD EVEN BE JUST YOURSELF WHY DO YOU WANT TO DO IT

FOR WHERE A NUMBER OF PLACES OFFER IT BUT GOOGLE BLOGS SEEMS PRETTY EASY
JUST DO IT IF YOU GIVE UP HALFWAY YOU LOSE NOTHING IF YOU WANT READERS PM ME AND YOU'LL GET ONE
I MYSELF AM ALSO IN MY FOURTH YEAR AND HAVE STARTED TO TOY WITH THE SAME IDEA A MOTIVATION FROM MY SIDE WAS TO USE IT AS A TOOL IN MY CAREER SO WHEN I GO LOOKING FOR MY PHD I COULD SUPPLY THE LINK AS A PART OF MY CV

WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY PROFESSORS IN THIS FORUM SELECTING AMONG PHD CANDIDATES IS WETHER YOU WOULD EVEN LOOK AT A POTENTIAL WEBSITE OR WOULD I JUST BE WASTING MY TIME WRITING AND BLOGGING ABOUT WHAT I HAPPEN TO FIND INTERESTING
DON'T HAVE ANY ADVICE FOR YOU BUT I WOULD DEFINITELY BE INTERESTED IN READING SOMETHING LIKE THIS
ONCE I GET MY SERVER HOSTED ONTO THE INTERNET YOU CAN PM ME

I FUCKING LOVE PHYSICS
THE PHYSICS CLASSROOM IS SPECIFICALLY AIMED AT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS

OPENSTAX IN ASSOCIATION WITH RICE UNIVERSITY HAS A FREE COLLEGE PHYSICS FOR AP COURSES ONLINE TEXTBOOK WITH PDF DOWNLOAD AVAILABLE

AND OF COURSE THERE'S THE FEYNMAN LECTURES ONLINE
THE FEYNMAN LECTURES ARE A PERFECT INTRODUCTION TO PHYSICS FROM HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL ALL THE WAY UP TO DEGREE LEVEL

A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF MATHS IS ESSENTIAL TO MORE ADVANCED PHYSICS AND THERE IS AN EXCELLENT TEXTBOOK WRITTEN BY TWO EXTREMELY QUALIFIED CALLED THE LANGUAGE OF PHYSICS A FOUNDATION FOR UNIVERSITY STUDY WHICH IS WHAT'S RECOMMENDED TO FIRST YEAR UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AND POSES QUESTIONS AT THE END OF EACH CHAPTER

IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING A LITTLE LESS INTIMIDATING THEN THE A VERY SHORT INTRODUCTION SERIES HAVE A PERFECT RANGE OF SHORT AND CHEAP BOOKS ON PHYSICS QUANTUM THEORY
RELATIVITY PARTICLE PHYSICS COSMOLOGY NUCLEAR PHYSICS BLACK HOLES THERMODYNAMICS ASTROPHYSICS LIGHT AND MAGNETISM THESE ARE GREAT LITTLE BOOKS THAT DON'T BLOW YOUR HEAD OFF

PHYSICS IS AN EXTREMELY INTERESTING SUBJECT TO READ AROUND AND I WISH YOU THE BEST WITH IT
THIS IS A LOT LIKE COMPLAINTS ABOUT DEMOCRACY AS A GOVERNMENTAL SYSTEM AS CHURCHILL SAID

INDEED IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT DEMOCRACY IS THE WORST FORM OF GOVERNMENT EXCEPT FOR ALL THOSE OTHER FORMS THAT HAVE BEEN TRIED FROM TIME TO TIME

POINTING OUT THE FACT THAT A SYSTEM HAS FLAWS IS NOT THE SAME AS PROVIDING A BETTER SOLUTION BEFORE THE DAYS OF METRICS I'D IMAGINE SCIENCE FUNDING WAS LARGELY DETERMINED BY WHO YOU KNEW WHO YOUR FRIENDS WERE AFTER ALL IF YOU READ THE BIOS OF ANY BIG PHYSICIST FEYNMAN ANDERSON WEINBERG WHOEVER IT'S ALWAYS LIKE I CALLED THIS BUDDY OF MINE AND HE GOT ME A POSITION AT BLAH BLAH BLAH THAT'S A PRETTY TERRIBLE WAY TO DISTRIBUTE FINITE RESOURCES

AS LONG AS HIRING AND TENURE ARE TIED TO FAME AND METRICS RESEARCHERS WILL LIKELY ADJUST THEIR BEHAVIOR TO MEET THESE STANDARDS WHICH BRAVE UNIVERSITY WILL START HIRING AND PROMOTING BLINDLY ANY TAKERS

EDIT DAMN YOU
IF RESEARCH IS PUBLICLY FUNDED THEN PUBLICATION BLACKOUTS SHOULD BE CANCELLED AND PUBLICLY AVAILABLE FREE PUBLICATION SHOULD BE MANDATED ALONGSIDE ANY COMMERCIAL PUBLICATION
YOU NEED TO TAKE SO MUCH PHYSICS AND MATH TO TAKE A LEGITIMATE QUANTUM MECHANICS COURSE THAT YOU BASICALLY NEED TO BE A PHYSICS MAJOR AT LEAST CLASSICAL MECHANICS AND WAVES IN PHYSICS AND AT LEAST CALCULUS LINEAR ALGEBRA AND DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS IN MATH MOST PROGRAMS WILL REQUIRE YOU TO TAKE ELECTROMAGNETISM AS WELL

I AM CONVINCED THAT ANYONE SMART ENOUGH TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE REDDIN INDEPENDENTLY IS SMART ENOUGH TO MANAGE AN UNDERGRADUATE MAJOR IN PHYSICS IF THEY'RE WILLING TO BLEED AND CRY FOR IT THE MOST IMPORTANT REQUIREMENT IS THE DESIRE TO LEARN IT BECAUSE IT'S HARD PHYSICS DESERVES ITS REPUTATION AS ONE OF THE MOST LIFE-CONSUMING MAJORS SO YOU NEED TO ENJOY THE PHYSICS OR YOU'LL HATE YOUR LIFE EDIT INTRO PHYSICS CAN BE KINDA BORING AND IT ISN'T VERY REPRESENTATIVE OF WHAT HIGHER LEVEL PHYSICS IS LIKE DON'T GIVE UP ON PHYSICS JUST BECAUSE CALCULATING THE ACCELERATION OF BLOCKS ON WEDGES IS DULL IT IS WE KNOW BUT YOU NEED TO DO IT TO GET AN INTUITIVE SENSE OF BASIC PHYSICS IT BUILDS YOUR BASIC PHYSICS MUSCLES

IF YOU ARE SATISFIED WITH A QUALITATIVE COURSE MOST LARGER UNIVERSITIES WILL OFFER A PHYSICS FOR POLITICIANS OR SURVEY OF PHYSICS CONCEPTS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT YOU WON'T REALLY LEARN THE MEAT OF QUANTUM MECHANICS IN THOSE COURSES

SOMETIMES THE CHEMISTRY DEPARTMENT WILL OFFER AN IN-BETWEEN COURSE THAT AORTA KINDA HAS SOME OF THE MATH INVOLVED BUT ISN'T NEARLY AS RIGOROUS OR DEEP AS AN ACTUAL PHYSICS COURSE THAT STILL WOULD REQUIRE YOU TO BE A CHEM MAJOR MINOR THOUGH

OH RIGHT AND HOW DO YOU START

TAKE CALCULUS IF YOUR HIGH SCHOOL OFFERS IT GO AS DEEP IN MATH AS YOU CAN

2 TAKE AP PHYSICS IF YOUR HIGH SCHOOL OFFERS IT GO AS DEEP IN PHYSICS AS YOU CAN

ENROLL IN LINEAR ALGEBRA ASAP IN UNIVERSITY AND GET STARTED ON THE INTRO PHYSICS FOR MAJORS TRACK

AT THIS POINT YOU'RE ON THE TRACK TO QM AND IT WILL HAPPEN EVENTUALLY
IF YOU GOOGLE GRIFFITHS QUANTUM MECHANICS YOU'LL QUICKLY FIND A PDF OF THE MOST COMMONLY USED TEXTBOOK FOR COLLEGE QM CLASSES HOWEVER YOU'LL QUICKLY FIND THAT YOU CAN'T JUST READ THROUGH IT AND UNDERSTAND ANYTHING WITHOUT TAKING A FEW MORE YEARS OF MATHEMATICS

SO THE QUESTION IS ARE YOU LOOKING FOR A QUICK WAY TO JUST LEARN SOME QM FOR THE LAYMAN OR ARE YOU THINKING OF ACTUALLY STUDYING PHYSICS IN COLLEGE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT BACKGROUND IS BUT YOU'LL NEED TO KNOW A FAIR AMOUNT OF MATHEMATICS TO REALLY LEARN ABOUT QUANTUM MECHANICS PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS LINEAR ALGEBRA CALCULUS THERE'S INFINITE DIMENSIONAL MATRICES AND ALL SORTS OF WEIRD STUFF THAT BEING SAID I LOVE QUANTUM IT'S REALLY QUITE AMAZING THE MORE YOU LEARN YOU SEE HOW THE WHOLE STRUCTURE FITS TOGETHER WONDERFULLY IF YOU'RE AN ENGINEER YOU'LL PROBABLY BE TAKING A LOT OF THESE MATH COURSES ANYWAY

ON THE OTHER HAND IF THAT DOESN'T SOUND TOO APPEALING TO YOU YOUR COLLEGE MAY OFFER LOWER LEVER INTRODUCTIONS TO THE SUBJECT A COURSE IN QUANTUM MECHANICS ISN'T AUTOMATICALLY HARD JUST BE CAREFUL BECAUSE IT MAY BE A LOT OF MATH EITHER WAY
AS OTHERS HAVE SAID YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO LEARN QM UNLESS YOU ACTUALLY INTEND TO BE A PHYSICIST A COURSE IN QM IS NOT ABOUT DISCUSSING THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS OF CATS AND ENTANGLEMENT IT IS A DENSE MATH HEAVY SLOG WHERE YOU CALCULATE ENERGY LEVELS OF HYDROGEN ATOMS AND ENERGY LEVEL SPLITTING DUE TO WEAK MAGNETIC FIELDS ETC QM CLASSES ARE ABOUT USING THE MATHEMATICAL MACHINERY OF QM TO CALCULATE EXPERIMENTALLY DETECTABLE QUANTITIES THEY'RE NOTHING LIKE A POPULAR SCIENCE TREATMENT ON THE SUBJECT
IM A PHYSICS STUDENT IN MY SECOND YEAR AND I HAVEN'T HAD A COURSE ABOUT IT YET BUT I HAVE HEARD FROM A FRIEND THAT AT UNIVERSITY LEVEL YOU WON'T UNDERSTAND A LOT YOU JUST GET USED TO IT APPARENTLY YOU ALSO NEED A PRETTY GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF LINEAR ALGEBRA

THEREFORE I WOULD NOT DO IT WITHOUT ANY PRIOR EDUCATION IN PHYSICS
YOU'LL NEED A BIT OF BACKGROUND AND WORK YOUR WAY UP SLOWLY IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN ATTEND ANY LECTURE AND IMMEDIATELY UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING TO BE HONEST THE STUFF THAT YOU DO IN A QUANTUM MECHANICS LECTURE IS NOT IMMEDIATELY CLEAR EVEN FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN STUDYING FOR ABOUT YEARS AT THAT POINT EVEN STUDENTS ARE CONSTANTLY STRUGGLING WITH IT
YOU COULD FIND A MODERN PHYSICS TEXTBOOK OFTEN THEY COVER RELATIVITY FIRST BUT THEY SHOULD COVER BASIC QUANTUM MECHANIC PRINCIPLES AS WELL AS THE BACKGROUND THAT FOUNDED QUANTUM MECHANICS PERSONALLY I WOULD SUGGEST THIS ROUTE BEFORE PICKING UP A QUANTUM MECHANICS DO IT FORMALLY DOES REQUIRE A GOOD RANGE OF MATHEMATICS THAT YOU SHOULD BE EXPOSED FIRST
GRAB A GRIFFITHS INTRODUCTION TO QUANTUM MECHANICS BOOK OPEN IT UP AND START READING AND DON'T STOP READING FOR HOURS STRAIGHT

IF YOU'RE STILL ENJOYING YOURSELF IMAGINE DOING THAT EVERY SINGLE NIGHT FOR A YEAR THAT SHOULD GIVE YOU A GOOD IDEA OF WHAT YOU'RE IN FOR
THERE ARE SOME GOOD LECTURES AVAILABLE ON YOUTUBE SUSSKIND IS POPULAR

FROM WHAT I RECALL YOU REALLY ONLY NEED TO KNOW MULTIVARIABLE CALCULUS PARTICULARLY PARTIAL DIFFERENTIATION BESIDES THAT GOOD PHYSICAL INTUITION AND LOTS OF ALGEBRA
THE CALCULUS SERIES AND A TEENSY TOUCH OF ODE EXPERIENCE WOULD BE USEFUL PROBABLY THE BIGGER THING WITH THERMODYNAMICS IS HAVING INTUITION ABOUT PHYSICAL SYSTEMS CONCEPTS DOMINATE THE SUBJECT
EVEN THE THIRD DERIVATIVE JERK DOESN'T GET MUCH ATTENTION IF YOU'VE TRIED TO LOOK IT UP I ASSUME YOU SAW PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT HOW IT'S RELEVANT TO THINGS LIKE ROLLER COASTER AND VEHICLE SAFETY BUT I THINK EVEN THAT IS ONLY TRUE IN A SORT OF SILLY WAY

THE HUMAN BODY CAN WITHSTAND A FAIR AMOUNT OF FORCE IF IT'S PROPERLY PREPARED YOU GET INTO A SAFE POSITION TENSE YOUR MUSCLES AND SO FORTH SOME OF THAT PROCESS IS CONSCIOUS BUT EVEN THE MOST ABSENT-MINDED PERSON WILL INSTINCTIVELY ADJUST A BIT TO PROTECT AGAINST A FORCE IF THEY FEEL THE FORCE STARTING BUT IF THE FORCE STARTS UP VERY SUDDENLY AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY PRIOR WARNING YOU MIGHT GET WHIPLASH FROM A FAIRLY WEAK FORCE

SO WHAT YOU WANT IS A WAY TO MEASURE HOW FAST A FORCE STARTS UP ACCELERATION IS PROPORTIONAL TO NET FORCE SO THE RATE OF CHANGE OF ACCELERATION JERK IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE RATE OF CHANGE OF FORCE AND MAKES A DECENT METRIC FOR THIS SORT OF THING BUT NONE OF THIS IS REALLY COMING FROM DEEP PHYSICAL PRINCIPLES IN FACT IT'S PRETTY SPECIFIC TO SYSTEMS THAT NEED TO REACT TO A FORCE IN A TIMELY FASHION LIVING THINGS AND MAYBE SOME UNUSUALLY SOPHISTICATED ROBOTS
IN A COLLEGE PHYSICS CLASSROOM SETTING NUMBER

SOURCE I'M A PHYSICS GRAD
NOT REALLY DERIVATIVES HIGHER THAN 2 AREN'T VERY MEANINGFUL IN PHYSICS IN GENERAL

FOR POSITION VELOCITY ACCELERATION SPECIFICALLY I THINK THIS CAN BE TRACED TO KINETIC ENERGY GOING LIKE VELOCITY SQUARED WHILE POTENTIAL ENERGY USUALLY DEPENDS ONLY ON POSITION AS YOU GO HIGHER IN PHYSICS YOU WILL LEARN THAT THE EQUATIONS OF MOTION CAN BE EXTRACTED FROM DERIVATIVES OF ENERGY SO ONLY SECOND DERIVATIVES AND LOWER TEND TO SHOW UP
I'VE STUDIED PHYSICS FOR QUITE A WHILE I HAVE A MASTERS IN PHYSICS AND I HADN'T EVEN HEARD OF JERK JOUNCE POP LOCK DROP UNTIL A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WHEN I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT IT

SO I'D SAY NO YOU'RE LIKELY TO NEVER SEE IT UNLESS YOU HAVE A PARTICULARLY QUIRKY PROFESSOR
I KNOW IN EITHER STRINGS OR TEMPERATURE WAVE FORMS YOU USE THE FIRST POSITION DERIVATIVE TO GRAPH THEM BUT WITH SOLID STRUCTURES SUCH AS STEEL BEAMS YOU USE THE FOURTH DERIVATIVE OF POSITION THIS IS ESSENTIALLY BECAUSE THE BEAM IS TOO RIGID TO HAVE MUCH OF A CHANGE IN POSITION OR VELOCITY SO YOU HAVE TO LOOK DEEP INTO ITS DERIVATIVES TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH IT

ANOTHER THING IN MANY MATHEMATICS THE INTEGRAL OF AN EQUATION IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND THUS TO APPROXIMATE ITS INTEGRAL YOU END UP USING AS MANY DERIVATIVES OF THE FUNCTION AS YOU CAN TO MAKE THE APPROXIMATED GRAPH AS CLOSE TO THE REAL GRAPH AS POSSIBLE THIS IS SEEN IN ANY INFINITE SUM CALCULUS II OR BC STUFF
JUST A QUICK OFF-THE-CUFF RESPONSE FROM MY PHONE WITHOUT TAKING A DETAILED LOOK AT YOUR CODE THE MOST COMMON CAUSE OF INSTABILITY IN LEAP FROG METHODS IS USING TOO LARGE OF A TIME STEP HIGHER ORDER METHODS COMPENSATE FOR THIS BY ESTIMATING THE ERROR AT EACH TIME STEP
SOMETIMES YES TAKE A LOOK AT THE EFFECT FOR EXAMPLE SOMETIMES YOU HAVE A DEGENERACY IN ONE OF THE STATES THAT ARISES BECAUSE OF THE SYMMETRY EAST G PAIRING OF THE D Z 2 AND D X 2 Y 2 ORBITALS OF A TRANSITION METAL COMPLEX WITH OCTAHEDRAL SYMMETRY IN AN IRREDUCIBLE REPRESENTATION IF THERE ARE MULTIPLE WAYS TO ARRANGE THE ELECTRONS IN THESE STATES LIKE IF YOU HAD ONE ELECTRON IN A PAIR OF ORBITALS THEN IT'S OFTEN POSSIBLE TO LOWER THE ENERGY OF THE STRUCTURE BY BREAKING THE SYMMETRY TO A SUBGROUP OF THE POINT SPACE GROUP THEN THE ENERGY LEVEL OF THE DEGENERATE ELECTRON IS LOWERED AS THE STATES SPLIT APART AND THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE IS STABILIZED

TL R YES SOMETIMES IF THE STRUCTURES ARE RELATED AND YOU CONSIDER NOT JUST THE SYMMETRY BUT ALSO THE EFFECTS OF SYMMETRY BREAKING
WITH SCANNING TUNNELLING MICROSCOPY YOU HAVE A RESOLUTION OF SCALES WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO DIRECTLY MEASURE IT

HISTORICALLY PEOPLE USED THE FACT THAT WAVES IN THE LATTICE NEED TO FIT BETWEEN THE ATOMS SO MEASURING THEIR WAVELENGTH OR ENERGY ALLOWS YOU TO CALCULATE THE LATTICE DISTANCE
AS U VERMEER SAID WITH MODERN TECHNIQUES LIKE ATOMIC FORCE MICROSCOPY AFM

BMG

AND SCANNING TUNNELLING MICROSCOPY STM

UPLOADS

YOU CAN NOW IMAGE AND EVEN PLACE INDIVIDUAL ATOMS

HOWEVER BEFORE THAT AND TO THIS DAY THE MAIN TECHNIQUE TO DETERMINE THE GENERAL PERIODIC ARRANGEMENT OF ATOMS AND THEIR SPACING IS X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHY ARD WHICH WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO FOR OVER A CENTURY HOWEVER IT DOESN'T GIVE IT IN SUCH A DIRECT WAY HERE'S AN X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHY IMAGE

SITES DEFAULT FILES RESOURCES ARTICLES

IT ACTUALLY GIVES THE INFORMATION IN WHAT IS CALLED RECIPRICOL SPACE THIS MEANS IT TAKES A BIT OF REVERSE ENGINEERING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE ACTUAL SPATIAL STRUCTURE IS THAT'S WHAT FOR EXAMPLE WATSON AND CRICK ARE SO FAMOUS FOR DETERMINING THAT DNA HAS A DOUBLE HELIX STRUCTURE PEOPLE HAD X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHY DATA OF DNA BUT IT WASN'T OBVIOUS WHAT THE BASE STRUCTURE WAS SUCH THAT IT WOULD PRODUCE SUCH DATA
JUST WONDERING IF ANYONE HERE WORKS OR HAS WORKED FOR THE CANADIAN SPACE AGENCY CURRENTLY IN MY UNDERGRAD AND PLANNING ON AT LEAST A MASTERS IN ASTROPHYSICS ASTRONOMY I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT ITS LIKE TO WORK THERE AND HOW HARD IT WOULD BE TO GET A JOB THERE
HOW MUCH WOULD MY RESUME FOR GRAD SCHOOL BE BOOSTED BY GRADUATING WITH A MA IN MATHEMATICS IN ADDITION TO A BS IN PHYSICS
Q PHYSICS GRADUATES WITH ONLY BACHELOR'S DEGREES WHAT DO YOU DO NOW
REASON FOR Q AM PHYSICS GRAD WORKING AT A CALL CENTER
UNDERGRAD HERE WHEN SHOULD I START SERIOUSLY THINKING ABOUT WHAT TO SPECIALIZE IN OR IF I EVEN WANT TO CONTINUE ON TO GRAD SCHOOL WHEN DID YOU DECIDE AND WHAT INSPIRED THE DECISION
ALREADY HAVE PHYSICS DECLARED AS A MAJOR AND I KNOW I WANT TO DOUBLE IT WITH SOMETHING BUT I'M NOT SURE WITH WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY GOING TO GO FOR ASTRONOMY BUT I DON'T WANT TO FORCE MYSELF IN A CORNER OF DOING THAT FOREVER KINDA WANNA KEEP MY OPTIONS MORE OPEN ALSO CONSIDERING COMPUTER SCIENCE OR MATHEMATICS THOUGHTS ON THE CHOICE SHOULD I TRY FOR A MINOR IN ONE OF THE ONES I DON'T GO WITH
LIKE SHARELATEX
OTERO IS PRETTY COOL
DROPBOX IS WIDELY USED IN THE PHYSICS COMMUNITY POINT DROPBOX TOWARDS YOUR PROJECT FILES AND VIOLA THEY ARE SYNCED ON ALL PARTITIONS COMPUTERS ETC
NOT NECESSARILY AN ENDORSEMENT BUT ALMOST ALL FACULTY I KNOW USES DROPBOX FOR THIS
IF YOU CONTINUE TO DO PHYSICS IN THE FUTURE DISCRETE INTEGRATION WILL SERVE YOU A LOT PROF BARBA MADE A COOL COURSE ON THE SUBJECT USING THE EX OF HAVIER STOKES EQUATIONS BUT YOU COULD ALSO TRY TO IMPLEMENT A STRENG OF MATERIALS SOLVER AND USE IT TO SOLVE A PROBLEM YOU CAN COMPARE WITH AN EXPERIMENT LIKE THE BENDING OF A PENCIL AS AN EX THIS WILL MAKE YOU FAMILIAR WITH INERTIA MATRIXES AND ALL YOU CAN DO WITH THEM ASWELL ONE OF THE THINGS I LIKED THE MOST TO DO WAS IMPLEMENTING RAYTRACING CODE IT'S NOT AHT SIMPLE BUT HAS A VERY SATISFYING RESULT AND FEELS LIKE PROFESSIONAL CODE TO WRITE AND RUN HELLO ENDLESS RUNTIME YOU MAY FINALLY WANT TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE PYTHON CODE POSTED IN R PHYSICS THAT IMPLEMENTS GRAVITY

ANOTHER IDEA IS TO HELP DEV CODE FOR VIDEOGAME MODS YOU LIKE THERE'S ALWAYS TONS OF WORK YOU CAN DO EVEN AT A MORE BASIC LEVEL
IF YOU HAVE DONE A BOX WITH PARTICLES THEN I WOULD ACTUALLY CONTINUE ON WITH THAT TO INTRODUCE YOURSELF TO ANALYSIS

CAN YOU GET THE MEAN SQUARED DISPLACEMENT OF THE PARTICLES CAN YOU PUT THEM IN A BOX WITH A EXIT HOLE SOMETIMES JUST PLAYING WITH YOUR OWN SYSTEMS IS THE BEST WAY TO LEARN THE NEXT EXTENSION OF YOUR CODE
TWO PROJECTS COME TO MIND

SIMULATING AN ISING MODEL SET OF PARAMAGNET THAT ARE POINTING UP OR DOWN USING THE MONTE CARLO METHOD MAY BE A LARGE DBI PROJECT BUT A LOT OF USEFUL THINGS TO LEARN
SIMULATING A HARMONIC OSCILLATOR SYSTEM STARTING FROM A DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION THEN ADD A DRIVING FORCE AND OR DAMPENING FORCE


I WOULD DO SOME QM MODELLING PLOTTING WAVEFUNCTIONS OF DIFFERENT POTENTIALS AND DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF DIMENSIONS IT'LL HELP MASSIVELY WITH YOUR QM INTUITION AND MATHEMATICAL AND PROGRAMMING SKILLS AND IT'LL ALSO BE COOL THERE'S ALSO A LOAD OF SIMILAR STUFF ONLINE YOU CAN USE FOR INSPIRATION CONFIRMATION
A BIT DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER SUGGESTIONS BUT YOU MAY WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT CONTRIBUTING TO SOME OPEN SOURCE SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES SUCH AS SNIPY OR DOING A GENERAL PROGRAMMING PROJECT RATHER THAN WORKING ON SOMETHING AS SOMEONE WHO DOES A GOOD BIT OF PROGRAMMING BOTH IN AND OUT OF PHYSICS THE CODE OF MOST PHYSICISTS AND SCIENTISTS IN GENERAL IS PRETTY AWFUL AS FAR AS STRUCTURE AND ORGANIZATION LEARNING A BIT OF TYPICAL COMP SCI STUFF CAN REALLY HELP OUT WHEN YOU WANT TO WRITE SCIENTIFIC SOFTWARE THAT ISN'T A ONE-OFF SIMULATION OR SOMETHING
THANK YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS OF WHERE TO LOOK

IM THINKING ABOUT TRYING PROJECT EULER IN EITHER C OR PYTHON AND SEEING HOW FAR I CAN GET
DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR HOW I COULD GO ABOUT DOING THIS NOT SOMETHING I HAVE THOUGHT OF DOING BEFORE
YOUR ORBIT FOR MERCURY SEEMS A BIT OFF CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY
YOU HAVE WRITTEN YOUR OWN FORWARD EULER INTEGRATION ROUTINE WHICH IS ALMOST ALWAYS GOING TO END POORLY THE THEORY OF NUMERICALLY APPROXIMATING SOLUTIONS TO DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS IS VERY MATURELY DEVELOPED GET YOURSELF A COPY OF NUMERICAL RECIPES FOR EXAMPLE UNLESS YOUR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION IS FINICKY YOU CAN ALMOST ALWAYS GET AWAY WITH USING A STANDARD CANNED INTEGRATION ROUTINE LIKE SEE EAST G
IF YOU'D LIKE TO SKIP THE WALK-THROUGH HERE'S A LINK TO THE CODE AND AND EXAMPLE VISUALIZATION

I WOULD LOVE TO SEE MORE POSTS LIKE THIS ONE COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS IS FUN TO PLAY WITH YOU CAN DO A LOT OF EXPERIMENTATION WITH LITTLE RESOURCES GREAT FOR LEARNING AND RESEARCH
AS SOMEONE WHO SPENT TODAY CODING PYTHON TUTORIALS FIRST TIME SINCE REQUIRED COLLEGE LEARNING LAST YEAR WITH A BIG DUMB SMILE ON MY FACE THIS EXCITES ME TO NO END
IN YOUR FUTURE POST USING C AND APC METHODS WILL YOU BE WRITING YOUR OWN FM
COOL I LIKE YOUR CODING STYLE VERY EXPLICIT AND ORGANIZED WITH THE CLASS DEFINITIONS YOU MIGHT BE DISAPPOINTED TO LEARN THAT IN PRACTICE ESPECIALLY FOR CALCULATIONS OF THIS NATURE PHYSICISTS SEEM TO HAVE A WAY MORE LAX APPROACH TO PROGRAMMING AND DON'T CARE SO MUCH ABOUT STRUCTURE THIS DEEP I'VE SEEN A LOT OF STUFF JUST THROWN INTO SCRIPTS I THINK SOME PHYSICISTS WOULD PROBABLY CALL YOUR USE OF OO INTERFACES A BIT OVERKILL FOR A PROBLEM OF THIS NATURE BUT I DON'T I WAS A COMPESCE MAJOR BEFORE PHYSICS SO I DIG IT HAHA ARE YOU IN SCHOOL NOW

EDIT COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICISTS DO OF COURSE PROGRAM WITH GREAT FORM ESPECIALLY FOR BIG PROJECTS I JUST MEAN CALCULATIONS LIKE THIS

EDIT 2 OKAY MAYBE EVEN I THINK THIS IS A BIT OVERKILL JUST LOOKED THROUGH YOUR CODE IT'S VERY NICE MAKES ME WANT TO GIVE IT A TRY BUT WHY DO YOU NEED TO USE THE POINT CLASS WHY NOT JUST DECLARE AN ACCELERATION FOR EXAMPLE AS A DICT

A X Y Z

A X 2



SEEMS LIKE PLENTY UNLESS YOUR POINT CLASS HAD SOME OTHER FUNCTIONALITY IT IS ALSO A BUT MISLEADING THAT THE CLASS IS CALLED POINT YET YOU USE IT TO ASSIGN VECTOR COMPONENTS

ALSO YOU DECLARE THE PLANET INFO AS DICTIONARIES BUT THEN YOU UNPACK ALL THAT INFORMATION INTO AN ARRAY OF BODY OBJECTS BUT YOUR BODY CLASS LIKE YOUR POINT CLASS IS PRETTY MUCH NO DIFFERENT THAN A DICT ANYWAY YOU JUST THROWN ALL THE PLANET DCTS INTO THE BODIES ARRAY AS THEY WERE AND NOT NEED THE BODY CLASS AT ALL OR AM I MISSING SOMETHING

SORRY IF THE CODE CRITIQUE ISN'T APPRECIATED I JUST LOVE THIS STUFF
I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE R SIMULATED AND YOU DID SOME FLIPBOOK THING FOR A SIMULATION I'M SLIGHTLY DISAPPOINTED NOW
FIRST DON'T READ NAOMI BOOK IT APPEARS AS A BESTSELLER IN THE CATEGORY BUT IT'S JUST ABOUT HER POLITICAL OPINION

I ALSO DON'T RECOMMEND JAMES STORMS OF MY GRANDCHILDREN IT'S TOO MUCH PERSONAL HISTORY AND HARDLY ANY GOOD EXPLANATION OF THE SCIENCE

MANN AND DIRE PREDICTIONS MIGHT BE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BUT I HAVEN'T HAD THE CHANCE TO READ IT YET
YOU MIGHT ALSO ASK R METEOROLOGY FOR HELP
IT'S NOT ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE PER SAY BUT I FOUND ENERGY FOR FUTURE PRESIDENTS BY RICHARD A MULLER TO BE A NICE INFORMATIVE BREEZY READ BEFORE BED IT'S BASICALLY ABOUT ENERGY POLICY CLIMATE AND DEBUNKING A LOT OF MISINFORMATION AROUND THE TOPIC HE ALSO HAS ONE CALLED PHYSICS FOR FUTURE PRESIDENTS WHICH COVERS A LOT OF THE SAME CONTENT NUCLEAR POWER WASTE SOLAR ENERGY COAL AND NATURAL GAS ETC
I DOUBT YOU'RE GOING TO FIND MUCH IN THE WAY OF BOOKS BEST BET IS TO HEAD OVER TO THE SITE AND START READING THROUGH THEIR REPORTS
REPORT
PRINCIPLES OF PLANETARY CLIMATE

EXCELLENT BOOK VERY READABLE ALSO GIVES YOU OPPORTUNITIES TO MODEL SIMPLE CLIMATE SYSTEMS IN PYTHON
JUST TO CLARIFY ARE YOU LOOKING FOR RESOURCES DESCRIBING CLIMATE CHANGE OR AN INTRODUCTION TO CLIMATE SCIENCE
WRONG SUB CONSCIOUSNESS ISN'T REALLY A QUESTION OF PHYSICS AND IN GENERAL THE QUESTIONS YOU ASK ARE NOT ANSWERED YET BY ANY SCIENCE OR BY PHILOSOPHY CERTAIN RELIGIONS WOULD POSSIBLY HOLD SOME OPINIONS ON THIS BUT FROM A SCIENTIFIC VIEW THOSE ARE MOSTLY WORTHLESS

IF YOU WANT SOME INFO ON THE CURRENT STATE ON THIS QUESTION THEN MAYBE HOFSTADTER THE I WOULD BE AN EASY TO READ INTRODUCTION IT'S FROM BUT THERE DIDN'T HAPPEN THAT MUCH ON THIS QUESTION RECENTLY

I THINK THERE ARE SOME BETTER REDDIN SUBS THAT ALLOW RATHER OPEN DISCUSSIONS ON THE SUBJECT

PS R COGSCI IS ONE SUBREDDIT DEDICATED TO THIS QUESTION HAVE A LOOK AT THEIR READING LIST
YOU MIGHT FIND THIS RATHER LONG POST INTERESTING

FIRST OF ALL I DON'T THINK PHYSICS CAN REALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION FULLY AND NEITHER COULD ANY SCIENCE WE DON'T KNOW THE PRECISE MECHANISM WHICH CAUSES CONSCIOUSNESS THE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE OF HAVING EXPERIENCE A LOT OF THAT IS IN THE TERRITORY OF PHILOSOPHY
THAT SAID I THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS ENTIRELY A MATERIAL PHENOMENON THAT THERE'S NO NEED FOR A SOUL I WAS ORIGINALLY GOING TO MAKE THE CLAIM THAT EVERY ATOM IN YOUR BODY IS REPLACED EVERY YEARS BUT APPARENTLY MANY NEURONS ARE PERMANENT SO THIS DOESN'T HOLD UP HOWEVER THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK THAT REPLICATING YOUR BRAIN WOULDN'T PRESERVE THE FUNCTION JUST LIKE REPLACING THE GEARS IN A CAR DOESN'T CHANGE THE CAR BASICALLY YOU CAN BE SURE THAT AN EXACT REPLICA OF YOUR BRAIN USING NEW ATOMS WOULD BE A FUNCTIONING BRAIN THE TWIN ANALOGY DOESN'T HOLD UP BECAUSE IF CONSCIOUSNESS IS A PHYSICAL PHENOMENON AND THE ORIGINAL BRAIN DIDN'T HAVE A MECHANISM FOR FUSING CONSCIOUSNESS THEN NEITHER WOULD THE NEW ONE TWO IDENTICAL COMPUTERS RUNNING THE SAME PROGRAM WOULD GIVE THE SAME OUTPUT BUT THEY'D JUST BE RUNNING SEPARATELY
PAST THIS POINT YOU MAY BE BETTER OFF ASKING NEUROSCIENCIENTISTS AND PHILOSOPHERS I DON'T KNOW HOW MEMORY IS STORED AND IF PRESERVING YOUR 3D STRUCTURE WOULD PRESERVE YOUR PERSONALITY AND MEMORIES THEN IT BECOMES A PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSION OF WHAT COUNTS AS YOU
YOU MIGHT ENJOY READING WHAT IS LIFE BY ERWIN SCHRODINGER
SO FAR WE KNOW OF NOTHING THAT CONTRADICTS THE RAZOR STATEMENT THAT CONSCIOUSNESS AND SELF-AWARENESS ARE EMERGENT PROPERTIES OF MATTER THIS MAY OR MAY NOT CHANGE IN THE FUTURE
THAT'S CORRECT IS CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE SPEED OF LIGHT FOR US TO MEASURE RED AND BLUESHIFT IN THE CB PHOTONS DUE TO THE DOPPLER EFFECT THE FREQUENCIES OF ALL CB PHOTONS ARE SLIGHTLY SHIFTED DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU'RE MEASURING THEM IN THE SKY

OF COURSE A STANDARD PROCEDURE OF COSMOLOGICAL DATA ANALYSIS IS TO REMOVE THE RED AND BLUESHIFT BY GOING TO THE REST FRAME OF THE CB
I JUST FOUND THIS SUB AFTER CURRENTLY READING THE BIG PICTURE BY SEAN CARROLL

THIS IS THE FIRST POST I'VE READ SO FAR AND MY MIND IS SUFFICIENTLY FUCKED
THANK YOU
NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY I'M JUST TOO STUPID TO UNDERSTAND WHY YOU CANT MEASURE ABSOLUTE SPEED RELATIVE TO THE UNIVERSE CB BY MEASURING LIGHT IN ALL DIRECTIONS

I KNOW ITS RELATIVE BUT ITS HARD TO GET HOW THE SPEED OF LIGHT EARTHS SPEED DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE LIGHT IS GOING FASTER THAN C

ONE TEST QUESTION I HAD WENT PARAPHRASING FROM MEMORY

A PHYSICS STUDENT WAS APPEARING IN TRAFFIC COURT FOR RUNNING A RED LIGHT THE STUDENT ARGUES THE TICKET SHOULD BE WAIVED SINCE AT THE SPEED HE WAS GOING THE RED LIGHT APPEARED GREEN THE JUDGE AGREES WITH THAT ASSESSMENT BUT THEN FINES THE STUDENT ONE DOLLAR FOR EVERY KM HR OVER THE POSTED SPEED LIMIT OF HR WHAT IS THE FINE

I REMEMBER IT BEING AROUND 2 BILLION

IT'S SIMPLE TO SHOW THAT
THERMAL PHYSICS BY SCHROEDER HAS A PROBLEM WHERE YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT IF YOU CAN THROW A DEAD DOG OUT OF A SPACESHIP WINDOW AND SURVIVE

IT WAS TAKEN FROM A JULES VERNE NOVEL

YOU CAN'T BTW
WE HAD ONE ABOUT A MAN WHO WAS ANNOYED WITH HIS OPERA SINGER WIFE SO HE STRAPPED HER TO A CAR AND DROVE AT A BRICK WALL WE HAD TO CALCULATE THE FREQUENCY SHE'D HAVE TO SING TO SHATTER THE WALL AND SURVIVE
ONE OF MY FAVORITES IS DOING A STABILITY ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF ROMEO AND JULIETTE WHEN LEARNING FLOWS
ONE OF MY FAVORITES CAME FROM THE GRIFFITHS QUANTUM MECHANICS BOOK IN A PROBLEM ASKING FOR YOU TO CALCULATE THE EXPECTATION VALUE OF MOMENTUM HE ADDS ON AS PETER LOIRE WOULD SAY DO IT ZE KEEK VA JOHNNY A REFERENCE FROM ARSENIC AND OLD LACE I LAUGHED MY ASS OFF WHEN I SAW THAT

I THINK I HAVE THE SAME TEXTBOOK MAYBE A DIFFERENT EDITION UNIVERSITY PHYSICS BY YOUNG FREEDMAN
THE TEXTBOOK I TEACH OUT OF HAS SOME GREAT ONES I PARTICULARLY LOVE THE HUGE SETUP ABOUT A GUY SWINGING ON A ROPE CRASHING INTO HIS CLONE WHICH THEN FLIES OFF OF A CLIFF CURSING ALL TO MAKE A PUN ABOUT AN OBSCENE CLONE FALL KILLS ME EVERY YEAR

PROJECTILES ARE ANOTHER GREAT MINEFIELD OF AWESOME PROBLEMS LIKE COYOTE'S AND ROADRUNNERS TRUCKS FULL OF WATERMELONS OR THE NAMES INGE AND OLAF WUT
THAT LOOKS LIKE THE BOOK I USED IN HIGH SCHOOL I CAN'T REMEMBER THE EXACT PHRASE BUT THERE WAS A PROBLEM WHERE PHYSICS MAJORS KIDNAPPED A POLITICAL SCIENCE MAJOR FOR CLAIMING THEIR FIELD WAS A REAL SCIENCE I WANT TO SAY IT WAS SOMETHING ABOUT CALCULATING THE VELOCITY OF THE CAR
THIS PROBLEM HETP FROM BOOK IT HAS BLACK HOLES HAPPY MONKEYS AND EVIL BABOONS
MY PHYSICS TEACHER LIKED INSERTING THE NAMES OF STUDENTS INTO ALL HIS TEST QUESTIONS

SO ONE TIME WE HAD TO CALCULATE IF CORY PUSHED JUSTIN BIEBER OFF OF A CLIFF HOW FAR AWAY WOULD HE LAND FROM THE EDGE GIVEN CLIFF HEIGHT AND HOW HARD CORY PUSHED HIM IGNORING AIR RESISTANCE
TO WALK OR TO RUN IN THE RAIN

I RECOGNIZE THAT TEXTBOOK AND THERE'S ONE IN THERE ABOUT A MINIVAN STOPPING ON A LITERAL DIME LIKE HERE'S THE DIAMETER OF A DIME AND THE MASS OF THE MINIVAN WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO STOP THE MINIVAN OVER THAT SMALL OF A DISTANCE

I REMEMBER CALCULATING THE ACCELERATION AND FORCE SO YOU'LL HAVE TO FLIP BACK A FEW CHAPTERS
WELL THIS PROBLEM ACTUALLY EXISTS ANYTHING THAT OPENS WITH YOU ARE A WORLD-FAMOUS MUST BE GOOD
THIS IS MY FAVORITE PROBLEM FROM MY HIGH SCHOOL STATS BOOK THIS WAS YEARS AGO SO ALL I HAVE IS A BLURRY PIC BUT IT STILL CRACKS ME UP TO THIS DAY THE FUNNIEST PART IS BASICALLY THAT THE CONTEXT IS ULTIMATELY IRRELEVANT TO THE ACTUAL PROBLEM WHICH JUST ASKS YOU TO OUTLINE A STATISTICAL STUDY AND CONDUCT RANDOMIZATION THE AUTHORS DIDN'T NEED TO WRITE A PROBLEM ABOUT SMOKING POT AND WEAVING BELTS BUT THEY JUST THOUGHT IT WAS FITTING FOR A HIGH SCHOOL TEXTBOOK GO FIGURE
THE TRANSPORT PHENOMENA BOOK I'M USING IN A CLASS RIGHT NOW DESCRIBED RANDOM WALK AS A DRUNKEN SAILOR TRYING TO FIND HIS WAY BACK TO HIS SHIP
THERE'S A PROBLEM IN THE GENERAL RELATIVITY SYLLABUS OF SEAN CAROL BASICALLY ABOUT AN ANGRY SPACE MONKEY WITH MURDEROUS INTENT THROWING A COCONUT ANOTHER SPACE MONKEY IN ORBIT AROUND A BLACK HOLE

YOU NEED TO CALCULATE THE CORRECT MOMENTUM OF THE COCONUT IN ORDER TO PUSH THE MONKEY OUT OF ORBIT INTO THE BLACK HOLE
I HAD ONE QUESTION ON AN EXAM ABOUT TWO WITCHES TRAVELLING TO A COVEN USING BROOMSTICKS THAT WERE CAPABLE OF RELATIVISTIC VELOCITIES I THINK ONE PART WAS CALCULATING THE ACTUAL LENGTH OF ONE OF THE NOSES AND ANOTHER WAS CALCULATING WHETHER THEY WOULD SURVIVE IF THEY GOT HIT IN THE HEAD BY A BUMBLEBEE WHILE FLYING HAHA
JOKE NOT A QUESTION CLASSICAL MECHANICS IS DISCUSSING TRANSFORMATION OF HAMILTONIAN H INTO ALTERNATE FORMS DENOTED KING HE REMARKS IF H STANDS FOR HAMILTONIAN K MUST STAND FOR HAMILTONIAN

I CAN'T FIND IT OR REMEMBER WHICH TEXTBOOK IT WAS IN BUT ONE BOOK I RECALL HAVING A LARGE DIAGRAM OF A CAT IN A POSSIBLY RADIOACTIVE BOX ANYONE ELSE REMEMBER SEEING THIS

WAY TOO MUCH OF THIS PAGE WAS DEDICATED TO THIS DIAGRAM
MINE DOESN'T BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY TEACHES INSTEAD OF TELLING LE FUNNY SCIENCE JOKES DDD
CLASSICAL MECHANICS BY TAYLOR IS A GO TO IN MY LIBRARY
WAS A BIG FAN OF KLEPPNER OF KOLENKOW FOR MY INTRO MECHANICS CLASSICAL NOT SURE WHAT LEVEL AP PHYSICS CALC IS BUT FOR REFERENCE WE USED IT FOR A FIRST YEAR UNDERGRAD CLASSICAL MECHANICS CLASSICAL HAVE HEARD GOOD THINGS ABOUT BOOK TOO BUT HAVEN'T EVER LOOKED THROUGH IT
I'VE NEVER USED THE KLEPPNER IT DOESN'T SEEM TO COVER LAGRANGIAN MECHANICS THOUGH BUT THE TAYLOR BOOK IS PRETTY GOOD HOWEVER THIS MIGHT NOT BE WHAT YOU WANT

IF YOU ARE TAKING INTRODUCTORY PHYSICS YOU PROBABLY DON'T WANT A MECHANICS BOOK BUT RATHER A PLAIN INTRO PHYSICS BOOK FOR THIS MANY OF THEM ARE JUST FINE AND ALL ABOUT THE SAME THEY AREN'T CHEAP THOUGH BUT IF YOU FIND AN OLDER EDITION YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO SCORE A DEAL AND THE PHYSICS IS ALL THE SAME

IF YOU WANT OTHER RESOURCES TO HELP PREPARE FOR INTRO PHYSICS I'M ASSUMING THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT BUT I COULD BE WRONG THEN I WOULD SUGGEST FINDING SOME GOOD STUFF ON YOUTUBE OR ONLINE SINCE THAT'S CHEAPER
LANDAU AND LIFSHITZ VOLUME TAYLOR IS PERFECTLY FINE
MORIN IS A WONDERFUL BOOK
PHYSICS FOR SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS WITH MODERN PHYSICS BY SEAWAY AND JEWETT REALLY GOOD BOOK AND HAS A TON OF CONTENTION
I AM BY NO MEANS AN EXPERT ON THIS SUBJECT BUT I'M GUESSING YES AND NUMBER THE CORE TEMPERATURE WOULD STAY THE SAME BUT AS THE STAR ROTATES IT WILL BULGE AROUND ITS EQUATOR AND THUS HAVE TO TRAVEL FURTHER OUT TO ITS SURFACE THIS COULD ULTIMATELY CHANGE ITS THERMAL EQUILIBRIUM AND A DECREASE IN LUMINOUS FLUX OR MAYBE NOT BUT LIKE I SAID I AM NO EXPERT SO MY WHOLE POST COULD BE IRRELEVANT
THERE IS APPARENTLY A NORMAL STAR WHICH IS SPINNING SO FAST THAT A PART OF ITS SURFACE IS MOVING AT OF THE SPEED OF LIGHT THAT SHOULD CAUSE APPROXIMATELY DUE TO THE DOPPLER EFFECT AT ONE EDGE OF THE STAR AND A ON THE OTHER SIDE SO THE COLOUR DIFFERENCE WOULD BE ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE

HOWEVER THERE IS A NEUTRON STAR WHICH IS ROTATING AT OF THE SPEED OF LIGHT I IMAGINE THAT THAT SHOULD CAUSE A MAJOR COLOUR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ADVANCING AND RECEDING SIDES

HOWEVER I AM NOT A PHYSICIST AND KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT STARS THIS IS BASED ON STRAIGHTFORWARD CALCULATIONS BASED THINGS FOUND ON WIKIPEDIA
TO BUILD ON THE OTHER RESPONSE ENERGY AND MOMENTUM CONSERVATION FOLLOW FROM INVARIANCE UNDER TIME AND SPATIAL TRANSLATIONS
THEY DROP OUT OF NORTHERS THEOREM AS DESCRIBED IN GENERAL IF YOU WRITE DOWN A QUANTUM FIELD THEORY SUCH AS THE STANDARD MODEL FOR EACH OF ITS SYMMETRIES YOU WILL OBTAIN A CONSERVED CURRENT ASSOCIATED WITH IT
SINCE THOSE EQUATIONS DON'T CARE ABOUT SUCH SHIFTS THE CONSERVED CURRENT IS THE TENSOR FROM THE ZERO COMPONENTS OF THIS CURRENT ONE CAN THEN CONSTRUCT A CONSERVED CHARGE WHICH IN THE CASE OF SPACETIME TRANSLATIONS ARE MOMENTUM AND ENERGY WHOSE TIME DERIVATIVES VANISH
IS IT AN EMPIRICAL STATEMENT THAT THEY ARE CONSERVED OR IS THERE SOME DEEPER MATHEMATICS TO IT

YES THERE ABSOLUTELY IS A DEEPER EXPLANATION THEOREM STATES A CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN CONSERVATION LAWS AND SYMMETRIES OF A SYSTEM

FOR EXAMPLE ENERGY CONSERVATION CORRESPONDS TO TIME SYMMETRY YOU CAN SHOW QUITE DIRECTLY USING RELATIVELY SIMPLE MATHEMATICS THAT IF THE LAGRANGIAN FOR A CERTAIN SYSTEM ARE THE SAME AT EVERY MOMENT IN TIME THEN ENERGY IS CONSERVED IN THAT SYSTEM SIMILARLY MOMENTUM CONSERVATION CORRESPONDS TO SYMMETRY IN SPACE

YOU CAN READ SEVERAL PROOFS OF THEOREM ON THE WIKIPEDIA PAGE OR CONSULT ANY ADVANCED MECHANICS TEXTBOOK BEWARE THAT THIS SUBJECT IS ON THE BORDER BETWEEN PHYSICS AND SOME QUITE ADVANCED DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY AND IF YOU ARE NOT EDUCATED IN THAT SUBJECT THEN SOME OF THE MATHEMATICS MIGHT BE FEARSOME NONETHELESS NAIVE DERIVATIONS THAT DON'T REQUIRE SERIOUS DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY ARE CERTAINLY AVAILABLE

TO SUMMARIZE ENERGY IS CONSERVED BECAUSE THE LAWS OF PHYSICS ARE THE SAME AT EVERY MOMENT IN TIME MOMENTUM IS CONSERVED BECAUSE THE LAWS OF PHYSICS ARE THE SAME AT EVERY POINT IN SPACE
IF YOU ACCEPT LAWS AS AXIOMS CONSERVATION OF MOMENTUM AND ENERGY FOLLOW AS EXACT MATHEMATICAL RESULTS THEN IT'S NOT EMPIRICAL

SYMMETRY IS A MUCH DEEPER ANSWER BUT THIS IS A SIMPLER ONE FOR CLASSICAL PARTICLES
READ UP ON HAMILTONIAN MECHANICS

IT IS NOT A FACT THAT ENERGY AND MOMENTUM ARE CONSERVED AND IT IS INDEED EMPIRICAL THAT OUR UNIVERSE HAS CONSERVATION OF ENERGY AND MOMENTUM

IF THE PARTIAL DERIVATIVE OF THE HAMILTONIAN H WITH RESPECT TO IS EQUAL TO ZERO THEN D DT FOLLOWING EQUATIONS AND THE MOMENTUM IS CONSERVED

IF THE HAMILTONIAN IS THINK THE OVERALL ENERGY OF THE SYSTEM DOES NOT CHANGE IN TIME THEN D DT H YOU CAN GO THROUGH AND DO THE CALCULATION YOURSELF

YOU CAN CREATE AN INFINITE NUMBER OF HAMILTONIAN SYSTEMS WHERE THE ENERGY IS NOT CONSERVED OR THE ENERGY IS CONSERVED AND OR THE MOMENTUM MAY OR MAY NOT BE CONSERVED IF YOU TELL ME SOME CONSERVATION LAWS I CAN CONSTRUCT YOUR OWN HAMILTONIAN SYSTEM WHERE THEY ARE TRUE

AS FOR OUR OWN UNIVERSE YES WE THINK THAT OUR UNIVERSE IS A HAMILTONIAN SYSTEM AND WE THINK THAT ENERGY AND MOMENTUM ARE CONSERVED BUT WE AREN'T SURE
IT IS SYMMETRY BUT TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOU WOULD FIRST NEED TO LEARN HOW MECHANICS CAN BE DERIVED FROM A LAGRANGIAN THIS PRINCIPLE APPLIES EVEN FURTHER TO CHARGE CONSERVATION BUT THAT IS A BIT MORE DIFFICULT

HOWEVER IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU SHOULD REVIEW A BIT CONSERVATION IS ONLY APPLIED IN SOME SYSTEMS AS YOU SHOULD KNOW WITHOUT EXTERNAL FORCES ON A SYSTEM OF PARTICLES F P DT EASILY IMPLIES CONSERVATION OF MOMENTUM

THE STRANGE NUMBERS ARE NOT FOUND IN COLLISIONS THEY ARE FOUND IN THEORETICAL CALCULATIONS

WHAT S NOT KNOWN IS HOW TO ESTIMATE AT WHAT POINT ONE SHOULD STOP CALCULATING DIAGRAMS

AT LEAST NOT AT THE CURRENT PRECISION SO FAR ADDING AN ORDER MORE ALWAYS HELPED

THIS IS THE BEST TL R I COULD MAKE ORIGINAL REDUCED BY I'M A BOT

FOR MATHEMATICIANS PHYSICS HAS CALLED TO THEIR ATTENTION A SPECIAL CLASS OF NUMBERS THAT THEY'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND IS THERE A HIDDEN STRUCTURE TO THESE PERIODS THAT OCCUR IN PHYSICS WHAT SPECIAL PROPERTIES MIGHT THIS CLASS OF NUMBERS HAVE FOR PHYSICISTS THE REWARD OF THAT KIND OF MATHEMATICAL UNDERSTANDING WOULD BE A NEW DEGREE OF FORESIGHT WHEN IT COMES TO ANTICIPATING HOW EVENTS WILL PLAY OUT IN THE MESSY QUANTUM WORLD

ONCE YOU KNOW THE PERIODS WHICH ARE SPECIFIC NUMBERS THAT'S ALMOST THE SAME AS KNOWING THE MOTIVE ITSELF SAID MINHYONG KIM A MATHEMATICIAN AT OXFORD

WEIGHT CAN ALSO BE USED TO SORT PERIODS INTO DIFFERENT TYPES ALL PERIODS OF WEIGHT ARE CONJECTURED TO BE ALGEBRAIC NUMBERS WHICH CAN BE THE SOLUTIONS TO POLYNOMIAL EQUATIONS THE PERIOD OF A PENDULUM ALWAYS HAS A WEIGHT OF PI IS A PERIOD OF WEIGHT 2 AND THE WEIGHTS OF VALUES OF THE RIEMANN ZETA FUNCTION ARE ALWAYS TWICE THE INPUT

FIRST YEAR WILL BE LARGELY A RE-TREAD OF HIGH-SCHOOL JUST TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE'S ON THE SAME PAGE IF YOU DIDN'T GET A FULL HIGH SCHOOL PHYSICS BACKGROUND I WOULDN'T WORRY TOO MUCH OTHER STUDENTS MIGHT BE MORE FAMILIAR BUT THAT'S WHY THE FIRST YEAR IS STRUCTURED THAT WAY TO MAKE SURE IF HIGH SCHOOL COULDN'T PROVIDE IT THAT YOU KNOW THE CONTENT YOU NEED TO MOVE FORWARD
MATHEMATICS LOTS OF MATHEMATICS IT'S GOING TO FEEL LIKE YOU SIGNED UP FOR A MATH CLASS THAT JUST HAS A PHYSICS THEME TO IT AND THE EQUATIONS YOU NEED TO USE WILL OFTEN SEEM VERY SIMPLE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD UNTIL YOU NEED TO APPLY THEM IN HOMEWORK PROBLEMS AT WHICH POINT YOU REALIZE YOU MAY NOT UNDERSTAND THINGS AS WELL AS YOU THOUGHT

YOU SEE PHYSICS IS A BIT DIFFERENT FROM OTHER COURSES IT'S NOT NECESSARILY HARDER BUT DIFFERENT ENOUGH THAT IT CREATES A STEEP LEARNING CURVE EARLY ON THAT INTIMIDATES MOST STUDENTS
I FOUND THERE TO BE A FEW JUMPS IN DIFFICULTY ALONG THE WAY SOME WERE DUE TO THE MATH AND SOME WERE DUE TO THE CONCEPTS

AT MY UNIVERSITY YOU LEARN INTRO MECHANICS MOST OF WHAT YOU LEARN IN HIGH SCHOOL THEN INTRO ELECTROMAGNETISM ALSO TOUCHED ON IN HIGH SCHOOL AND THEN AN INTRO CLASS FOR SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND QUANTUM MECHANICS AFTER TAKING ALL THE INTRO CLASSES YOU REVISIT EACH TOPIC IN DETAIL TAKING A YEAR OF ADVANCED MECHANICS THEN A YEAR OF REAL ELECTROMAGNETISM A YEAR OF QUANTUM THEN ELECTIVES

THE FIRST BIG JUMP IN DIFFICULTY FOR ME WAS LEARNING ELECTROMAGNETISM THIS WAS DIFFICULT BECAUSE I SLACKED WHEN LEARNING CALC VECTOR CALCULUS USED HEAVILY IN E M IT WAS ALSO THE BEGINNING OF THINGS GETTING PRETTY ABSTRACT OUTSIDE OF WHAT HUMANS TYPICALLY EXPERIENCE WITH MECHANICS MOST OF THE TIME IF YOU APPLY COMMON SENSE AND MATH YOU CAN WORK MOST THINGS OUT FROM SCRATCH OBVIOUSLY IT GETS DIFFICULT BUT IT ALWAYS SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE TO PREPARE FOR E M I WOULD MAKE SURE TO BE READY FOR LOTS AND LOTS OF MATH PARTICULARLY SOME THOSE LATER CALC CLASSES

QUANTUM MECHANICS TRIPS A LOT OF PEOPLE UP ITS QUANTUM AND ITS CONFUSING AND THERE'S REALLY NO WAY AROUND IT FROM MY EXPERIENCE THE DIFFICULTY IN QUANTUM WAS UNDERSTANDING THE CONCEPTS AND WHAT WAS GOING ON THE MATH WASN'T AS BAD AS OTHERS I'M NOT SURE WHAT SOMEONE COULD TO DO PREPARE FOR QUANTUM ITS SOMETHING THAT YOU NEED TO GET YOUR HANDS ON AND WORK WITH TO UNDERSTAND THE BEST APPROACH TO QUANTUM WOULD PROBABLY BE TO WORK WITH OTHERS AND TALK IT OUT AND ASK THE INSTRUCTOR QUESTIONS IT PROBABLY WON'T MAKE SENSE THE FIRST TIME YOU HEAR IT AT LEAST IT DIDN'T FOR ME SO IT WAS NICE TO BE ABLE TO GO OVER THINGS MULTIPLE TIMES WITH CLASSMATES AND THE PROFESSOR

OTHER THAN THAT ALWAYS TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE PHYSICS AND THE MATHEMATICS DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF PHYSICS USE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MATH AND UNDERSTANDING HOW THAT ALL WORKS WAS DEFINITELY VALUABLE FOR ME YOU CAN DROWN IN THE MATH AND A LOT OF PEOPLE SEEM TO BUT IF YOU KEEP AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE MATH TRANSLATES TO THE PHYSICS YOU CAN AVOID A LOT OF UGLY MATH USING TRICKS RELATED TO THE PHYSICS OF THE PROBLEM FOR EXAMPLE EXPLOITING SYMMETRY IN A PROBLEM CAN MAKE NASTY MATH VIRTUALLY DISAPPEAR ITS A PHYSICS MAJOR NOT MATHEMATICS SO DESPITE THE CRAZY AMOUNT OF MATH INVOLVED YOU'RE DOING PHYSICS AND PEOPLE LOSE SIGHT OF THAT AND TRY TO BRUTE FORCE THE MATH WHEN IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY

I'M FINISHING UP MY DOUBLE MAJOR THIS YEAR AND I'VE LOVED IT SO IF ANY OF THAT RAMBLING WALL OF TEXT SOUNDS NEGATIVE IT WASN'T MEANT TO ITS BEEN VERY CHALLENGING AND VERY REWARDING WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR

BLDR ITS GREAT BE READY FOR JUMPS IN DIFFICULTY WHEN LEARNING A NEW TOPIC E M INTRODUCES SCARY MATH BUT IT'S DOABLE QUANTUM IS CONFUSING FOR EVERYONE SO DISCUSSION IS USEFUL THERE IS A METRIC SHIT LOAD OF MATH BUT KEEP AN EYE ON THE PHYSICS
I REMEMBER IT BEING A LARGE STEP UP IN DIFFICULTY DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU GO THERE WILL BE LOTS OF PEOPLE TO WORK WITH WHICH PERSONALLY HELPED ME A LOT PLUS IT'S ALWAYS AWESOME HAVING A BUNCH OF PEOPLE THAT YOU CAN NERD OUT WITH ABOUT MATH OR PHYSICS
DEPENDS ON THE INSTITUTION MY EXPERIENCE WAS THAT THE FIRST TWO OR THREE SEMESTERS WERE PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD BY THE END OF SOPHOMORE YEAR YOU'LL START GETTING TRUSTED WITH SOME TOUGHER CONCEPTS JUNIOR YEAR IS TYPICALLY WHERE THE BIGGEST JUMP IN DIFFICULTY OCCURS

ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON HOW EASY DIFFICULT YOUR FIRST YEAR WILL BE IS WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAD ANY EXPOSURE TO CALCULUS IN HIGH SCHOOL I CAME IN HAVING ALREADY DONE THE BC CALCULUS AP AND IT GAVE ME A PRETTY BIG LEG UP TO HAVE ALREADY HAD A CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF DIFFERENTIATION AND INTEGRATION
DIDN'T TAKE A SINGLE PHYSICS COURSE IN HS AND ONLY CALC AB BUT ENJOYED IT CAME IN AS AN ENGINEER TO A HIGHLY ACCREDITED UNI HATED EE AND SWITCHED TO ENGINEERING PHYSICS AT THAT TIME I HAD TAKEN NEWTONIAN MECHANICS E M AND A WAVES AND OPTICS COURSE UNI PHYS I DIDN'T DO TOO WELL CAUSE I DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THOSE BECAUSE NOTHING NEW HAS COME ABOUT IN THOSE FIELDS IN OVER YEARS BUT JUNIOR YEAR I GOT HIT WITH THE BIG GUNS AND TOOK ATOMIC AND NUCLEAR PHYSICS IN THE NUCLEAR ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT HAVE TO SAY THE LEARNING CURVE TO MODERN PHYSICS IS STEEP BUT IT IS WORTH IT I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT I'M NOW STUDYING PLASMA PHYSICS AND NUCLEAR FUSION ENGINEERING HAVE TO SAY I CAN'T IMAGINE MYSELF DOING ANYTHING ELSE REALIZE UNI ISN'T HIGH SCHOOL COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR YOUR REGULAR STATE COLLEGE THE SHIT IS HARD AND IT DESERVES YOUR TIME ESPECIALLY PHYSICS READ YOUR TEXT BOOKS BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE YOU GET YOUR DEEP THEORETICAL UNDERSTANDING PROFS ARE THERE TO HELP YOU GET THROUGH LEARNING IT AND NOT HOLD YOUR HAND AND ASK IF YOU'RE OK YOU GET OUT OF IT WHAT YOU PUT IN GO TO OFFICE HOURS ASK QUESTIONS AND READ YOUR TEXT BOOK JUNIOR YEAR IS HARD CAUSE YOU'RE STARTING TAKING HARD MATHEMATICAL CLASSES THAT AREN'T OVERVIEWS BUT BY SENIOR YEAR YOU GET USE TO IT AND START TAKING PHYSICS ELECTIVES THAT ARE A LOT OF FUN
FOR PARTICLE PHYSICS REPAIRING AND TESTING CIRCUITS AND HARDWARE IS PROBABLY AT THE TOP FOR EXAMPLE CHECKING THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL SENSOR ON AN AREA DETECTOR WORKS IS SOMETHING I CAN SEE AN UNDERGRADUATE WORKING ON
IN MY EXPERIENCE LOTS OF REPEATING THE SAME PROCEDURE OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN SEE AS AN UNDERGRAD YOU WOULDN'T TYPICALLY BE IN CHARGE OF ANY EXPERIMENTS YOURSELF YOU'RE THERE AS AN ASSISTANT TO THE GRAD STUDENTS TAKING CARE OF THE MENIAL WORK SO THEY CAN FOCUS ON MORE IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE WRITING GRANT PROPOSALS AND PREPARING FOR CONFERENCES AND ACTUALLY ANALYZING THE DATA YOU COLLECTIVE

SO IN MY CASE THE WORK WAS USUALLY SOMETHING LIKE HERE ARE THE SAMPLES WE WANT TO ANALYZE PUT THEM IN THE MACHINE AND COLLECT REFLECTION AND ABSORPTION MEASUREMENTS BETWEEN AND NM WAVELENGTH IN NM INCREMENTS
CALIBRATING DETECTORS
DATA ANALYSIS
INTERESTING I BELIEVE THAT'S WHY DATA SCIENCE IS BECOMING ALWAYS MORE NEEDED AND DATA SCIENTIST ARE PAID INCREDIBLY WELL IS NOT ONLY ABOUT STORING THEM BUT HOW TO DISPLAY LARGE AMOUNT OF DATA
PILOT G 2 I BUY THEM IN HUGE PACKS AT COSTCO IT'S THE ONLY PEN I USE
YOUR BASIC BIC MECHANICAL PENCIL IS THE PREFERRED FOR ALL MY MATHEMATICS DOING MATH IN PEN IS A SPECIAL HORROR I SHOULD NEVER WISH INFLICTED ON EVEN MY GREATEST ENEMY IF I HAD ONE

I'VE TRIED SO MANY DIFFERENT ULTRA FINE POINT PENS TO MAKE SCRATCH WORK NEATER AND THEY ALL HAVE ISSUES LIKE RUNNY INK ROUGH LINES ETC

I'M A LEFTIES SO I SMUDGE ALL OVER WHAT I WRITE ANYWAYS PLUS MY WRITING IS SO HORRENDOUS I CAN'T EVEN READ IT MYSELF THE NEXT DAY I MOSTLY DO MATH TO GET IDEAS STRAIGHT IN MY HEAD FOR THE HERE AND NOW OR TO GET SOME EXPRESSION THAT I THEN COPY INTO MY LATEX RESEARCH NOTES
I USE A DENTEL GRAPHGEAR AS MY MECHANICAL PENCIL BUT I MOSTLY USE A VARIETY OF FOUNTAIN PENS CHECK OUT R FOUNTAINPENS
I ONLY EVER USE PENCILS

TICONDEROGA 2 BLACK WOOD

THEY HAVE THE BEST GRAPHITE AND ERASERS I'VE YET TO FIND ON ANY PENCILS THEY ALSO SHARPEN BEAUTIFULLY NONE OF THAT CRAP THAT CHEAP PENCILS DO WHEN YOU TRY TO SHARPEN THEM
MM PEN
NICE MEDIUM BETWEEN TOO FINE AND TOO THICK THEY ARE WRITE A LOT BETTER THAN PEN YOU BUY IN LIKE PACKS OF AND INKS ARE CHEAP ON AMAZON
I USE A PARKER URBAN PREMIUM BLUE FOUNTAIN PEN WITH QUINK IT GLIDES LIKE NOTHING ELSE DRAWING ORBITALS AND MOLECULAR BOUNDS IS A JOY IN THE PAST I HAD TIMES WHEN I ONLY USED MM RED ROARING PENCILS OR BLACK PILOT FRIXION PEN MM
I HAVENT DONE ANYTHING IN PENCIL SINCE FIRST YEAR UNDERGRAD WHEN I GOT PAPERS BACK ALL SMEARED

I AM PICKY ABOUT BUYING PRETTY STATIONERY SO I MOSTLY BUY FROM THEY HAVE REFILLABLE PENS TOO SO I END UP WITH THE SAME PENS EVERY TIME I'VE FOUND SOME VERY SMOOTH ONES SMOOTHNESS IS PRETTY MUCH MY MAIN VARIABLE WHEN LOOKING AT PENS I GO FOR BLACK OVER BLUE TOO
I SPECIALIZE IN THAT FIELD

THERE'S NO BETTER PEN THAN THE

UNIBASAL EYE MICRO MM UB

THERE'S A SLIGHTLY THICKER EVERSON UNIBASAL EYE FINE MM WHICH I DON'T LIKE

THEY ARE EXTREMELY ACCURATE NEVER SMEAR I SWEAR THESE ARE THE BEST TRY THEM I PREFER BLACK OR BLUE

S REF NRL PRODUCTS UNIBASAL EYE MICRO RH N EYE MICRO

DP REF S IE DTF QID SR KEYWORDS UNIBASAL EYE FINE

I'VE TRIED JETSTREAM ONCE FRANKLY IT'S SHIT COMPARED TO THIS

WHEN I USE PENCILS I USE MECHANICAL ONES HB WITH MM THICKNESS
MOSTLY I USE MY PILOT CUSTOM FOUNTAIN PEN WITH FINE NIB

HERE ARE SOME STOCK PICTURES OF THIS BEAUTIFUL WRITING INSTRUMENT






I'VE ALWAYS USED PENCIL FOR ANY SCRATCH WORK AND NOTES MY PENCIL OF CHOICE HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE DENTEL QUICKER CLICKER THAT YOU CLICK WITH YOUR INDEX FINGER I FIND IT INTERRUPTS MY FLOW LESS WHEN ADVANCING THE PENCIL LEAD

FOR PENS UNIBASAL ROLLER MICRO OR PILOT PRECISE EXTRA FINE ARE MY PREFERRED PENS
UNIBASAL JETSTREAM IS MY FAVORITE OR MM THE INK DRIES INSTANTLY AND IT'S VERY SMOOTH PENCIL SMEARS TOO MUCH IMO
I'M NOT A FAN OF MOND BUT I'M ALSO NOT A FAN OF THE KLUDGE THAT IS DARK MATTER

STILL DARK MATTER FITS THE EVIDENCE AVAILABLE THUS FAR SO IT WINS AT LEAST UNTIL WE HAVE MORE DATA
DID WOLFIE JUST CASUALLY SLIP IN HIS CELLULAR AUTOMATA THEORY OF EVERYTHING AGAIN IS HE PHYSICALLY CAPABLE OF SHUTTING UP ABOUT IT
TL DR CELLULAR AUTOMATA THE ANSWER IS ALWAYS CELLULAR AUTOMATA
YOU SAY SPOILERS BUT THE ARTICLE SAYS

THIS POST IS ABOUT THE MOVIE ARRIVAL THERE ARE NO MOVIE SPOILERS HERE

NOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
I MUST LIVE UNDER A ROCK BECAUSE I'VE NEVER HEARD OF WOLFRAM LANGUAGE ALTHOUGH I DID USE WOLFRAM ALPHA FOR CALC WHAT'S THE DEAL DO PEOPLE USE IT

I TRIED TO COPY THE CODE AND TRY IT OUT ON MY LAPTOP WHEN I REALIZED IT WAS JUST AN IMAGE
WAIT THE WOLFRAM WAS NAMED AFTER A GUY PHYSICS TURNS INTO TIL SOMETIMES
I IMAGINE IT WOULD BE SIMILAR STRUCTURE TO THE STATEMENT OF PURPOSE SOP THAT GRAD SCHOOL PROGRAMS ASK FOR SO IF YOU LOOK UP GRAD SCHOOL APPLICATION ESSAYS YOU'LL FIND TONS OF TIPS AND SAMPLES ONLINE OBVIOUSLY YOUR RESEARCH EXPERIENCE WON'T BE AS EXTENSIVE IF YOU HAVE ANY AT ALL SO YOUR ESSAY WOULD FOCUS MORE ON WHY YOU'RE INTERESTED IN A RESEARCH TOPIC RATHER THAN YOUR PAST EXPERIENCES
WHAT ARE YOU INTERESTED IN WHAT ARE YOU GOOD AT WHY DO YOU WANT TO DO IT WHY WOULD YOU BE GOOD FOR IT GIVE THE SUPERVISOR A REASON TO PICK YOU DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT FITTING SOME GENERAL IN MY OPINION IF YOU REALLY WANT TO DO A AEU JUST WRITE AN HONEST PARAGRAPH OR TWO WHY
AS THE PHYSICS SUBREDDIT NOW BECOMES A GIANT ONE

REALLY THIS IS ALREADY I THINK THE SLOWEST MOVING SUB I VISIT WITH A HANDFUL OF TOP-LEVEL POSTS AND MAYBE OF NEW COMMENTS EACH DAY WITH RARE SPIKES THAT LOCALIZE IN A SINGLE THREAD LIKE JOB ANGST POSTS OR FUNNY TEXTBOOK QUESTIONS THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE SUBSCRIBED I GUESS BUT VERY FEW REGULARS

I FEEL LIKE IN THE BEST CASE THIS SORT OF WILL BE REDUNDANT ANY USEFUL CONTENT ON YOUR SUB WILL EITHER ORIGINATE OR END UP CROSSPOSTED HERE BUT IN THE WORST CASE IT JUST CANNIBALIZES POTENTIALLY GOOD CONTENT FROM THIS ALREADY SMALL SLOWLY PACED SUB

SO NO OFFENSE BUT I HOPE YOU FAIL MISERABLY NOT BECAUSE OF ANY TOWARDS YOU BUT SO THAT YOU'LL COME BACK AND MAKE R PHYSICS A BETTER PLACE FOR QI NEWS AND DISCUSSION
THERE'S ALREADY A R QUANTUMCOMPUTING SUBREDDIT HOW DOES YOURS DIFFER
MEASURE IT PUT A LITTLE TAB OF TAPE ON IT THAT MAKES A LITTLE AS IT GOES AROUND RECORD IT WITH A HIGH SAMPLE RATE AND EITHER MEASURE THE TIME BETWEEN TICKS OR FFT THE AUDIO AND SEE IF YOU CAN PICK IT OUT FROM AMONG THE BIGGEST SPIKES OR HOOK THE AUDIO UP TO AN OSCILLOSCOPE IF YOU HAVE THE EQUIPMENT OR ASSIGN IT AS AN EXTRA CREDIT PROBLEM FOR YOUR STUDENTS
I MEAN YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE THEORETICAL RPM THROUGH EASY ENOUGH CALCULATIONS BUT COUNTING IT IS MORE ACCURATE
CONGRATS AND STAY SOBER YOUR GA IS JUST START APPLYING EVERYPLACE WHERE YOU DON'T MIND MOVING TO YOU MIGHT START AS A TECH AND MOVE UP FROM THERE DON'T RULE OUT TECHNICIAN FROM YOUR CL SEARCH TO GET YOUR FOOT IN THE DOOR AND BUILD SOME EXPERIENCE SILICON COMPANIES HIRE BA PHYSICS TO RUN THE DOLLAR VACUUM AND VAPOR DEPOSITION TOOLS YOU MIGHT HAVE TO APPLY TO A LOT OF PLACES TO GET A HIT GOOD LUCK TO YOU
ENGINEERING GRAD SCHOOL YOU'LL GET A MORE FOCUSED DEGREE THAT WILL HELP YOU GET A JOB AND ENGINEERING IS A CAKE WALK AFTER COMPLETING A DEGREE IN PHYSICS
GRAD SCHOOL
ALSO IN LONG TERM RECOVERY

ALSO GRADUATING IN A MONTH WITH A BS IN PHYSICS

MY SUGGESTION IS GRAD SCHOOL BUT WITH NO RESEARCH EXPERIENCE IT WILL BE HARD VERY HARD



EMAIL LOCAL COLLEGE PROFESSORS ASK IF YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE HELP WITH ANY PROJECTS THEY ARE WORKING ON THIS IS AN EASY WAY TO START BUILDING YOUR EXPERIENCE THOSE PROFESSORS WILL ALSO BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL IN ASSISTING YOU ASSUMING YOU FORM GOOD RELATIONSHIPS GRAD SCHOOL IS SOMETHING YOU SHOULD BE CONSIDERING IF YOU WANT TO WORK IN PHYSICS ALSO JUST APPLY AND APPLY FOR THE POSITIONS YOU WANT DON'T BE DISCOURAGED IF YOU DON'T RECEIVE POSITIVE RESULTS IMMEDIATELY A PHYSICS DEGREE WILL TURN HEADS CONGRATS ON YOUR SOBRIETY THAT IS A TRUE TESTAMENT TO YOUR CHARACTER AND WILLIAM
CAME BACK TO SAY YOU COULD PROBABLY GET INTO A LOWER TIER UNIVERSITY THAT IS TRYING TO BUILD ITS NAME AND EXPAND IT'S PROGRAM

GET A MASTER'S THERE PROVE YOURSELF THEN GO GET A PHD SOMEWHERE BETTER
WAS IN YOUR SAME POSITION INSTEAD OF GOING TO GRAD SCHOOL I HIGHLY RECOMMEND FINDING EITHER STARTUPS OR SMALL COMPANIES TO WORK FOR THE REASON ESPECIALLY FOR STARTUPS IS THAT THESE 2 TYPES OF COMPANIES ARE LOOKING FOR MORE ROUNDED PEOPLE THAT CAN DO A LOT OF DIFFERENT TASKS

I STARTED AT A SMALL COMPANY WHERE I LEVERAGED MY LAKEVIEW EXPERIENCE ALL I KNEW WAS HOW TO PRESS THE BUTTON RIGHT AND THEN ON MY JOB I LEARNED HOW TO PROGRAM IN PYTHON AND LAKEVIEW AND IN ALDUINO AS WELL AS GET EXPERIENCE AS A TEST ENGINEER

IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS GIVE ME A PM I'LL BE MORE THAN WILLING TO HELP
I HAD A SIMILAR GA FOR A B SOUTH AND SOME RESEARCH BUT NOT MUCH AND NO PUBLICATIONS I WAS ACCEPTED TO A FEW PHD PROGRAMS FUNDED I THINK IF YOU WANT TO DO GRAD SCHOOL YOU CAN APPLY TO STATE SCHOOLS

I HAD A FRIEND WITH A SIMILAR GA GET A POSITION AS A LAB TECH FOR A REPUTABLE LABORATORY HE WAS BIOCHEM BUT I AM SURE YOU COULD DO THAT AS WELL

EDIT I APPLIED FOR JOBS OUT OF UNDERGRAD AS A BACKUP TO GRAD SCHOOL I IMMEDIATELY GOT AN ENGINEERING POSITION OFFERING NEARLY FIGURES SO I AM NOT SURE WHY EVERYONE IS POSTING SUCH NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES MAYBE THEY INTERVIEW POORLY

I GRADUATED WITH A B A PHYSICS IN SHIT IS ROUGH MANUAL GOOD LUCK

FIRST JOB OUT OF COLLEGE I MADE HR AS AN EE OF SORTS A LOT OF HARDWARE PROGRAMMING I WAS LUCKY TO HAVE A MANAGER WHO WAS VERY PATIENT AND TAUGHT ME EVERYTHING HE COULD I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET MY CURRENT JOB WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE I GAINED FROM HIM

NOW MAKE HR DOING SIMILAR EE EE TECH STUFF

YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BUST YOUR BALLS JUST TO MAKE A FRACTION OF WHAT YOU'RE PROBABLY WORTH UNLESS YOU GET A PHD PHYSICS OR A MASTER'S IN SOME OTHER FIELD
CONGRATULATIONS ON GETTING CLEAN MANUAL DO YOU HAVE ANY PROGRAMMING EXPERIENCE I GRADUATED WITH A BA BACK IN MAY AND NOW WORK AS A SOFTWARE ENGINEER IN THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY

IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT A POOR GA AND LACK OF EXPERIENCE WORKING PROFESSIONALLY CAN PROBABLY HELP MAKE UP FOR THAT
MY ADVICE IS AS FOLLOWS

ON YOUR RESUME WRITE BACHELORS INSTEAD OF BA OR BS

LOOK FOR WORK AS A ENGINEER OR ACCOUNTANT OR ANYTHING ELSE TECHNICAL OR MATH RELATED YOU MIGHT ENJOY

PHYSICS POSITIONS ARE FEW AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE
IF YOU ARE WILLING TO MOVE IN A MORE COMPUTATIONAL DIRECTION YOU SHOULD CHECK OUT COMPUTER SCIENCE MASTERS PROGRAMS

ONE THAT'S GENERATED A LOT OF BUZZ IS GEORGIA ONLINE MASTERS OMS CS WHICH IS A TOTALLY ONLINE PROGRAM COSTS LIKE IN TUITION TOTAL AND IS AN ACCREDITED MASTERS FROM A TOP CS UNIVERSITY NOT SURE EXACTLY HOW SELECTIVE THEY ARE BUT AVERAGE INCOMING GA IS AROUND A LOT OF PHYSICS JOBS INVOLVE REQUIRE A LOT OF PROGRAMMING ANYWAY AND THIS WOULD ALSO OPEN THE DOOR TO LESS BUT STILL VERY INTERESTING JOBS
I'M WORKING ON MY B A IN PHYSICS I PLAN TO GO TO THE PEACE CORPS FOR 2 YEARS AND WHEN I GET BACK THE GOVERNMENT WILL PAY FOR YOUR GRADUATE SCHOOL
WITH ALL THAT SAID I REALLY WANT TO PURSUE A CAREER IN PHYSICS

YOU WON'T

DO I HAVE ANY SHOT AT LANDING ANY INTERNSHIPS LAB TECH POSITIONS WITH MY DEGREE

NOPE

DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY ADVICE OR WORDS OF WISDOM OR MAYBE SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR ME TO START MY CAREER IN THE FIELD OF PHYSICS

GIVE UP NOW

LOOK FOR A CAREER IN IT OR IF YOU'RE LUCKY SOME TYPE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING JOB YOU CAN START AT THE GROUND FLOOR MAYBE AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU AN POSITION

I'M SORRY FOR SOUNDING NEGATIVE BUT I AM JUST GIVING YOU THE FACTS FROM MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

I GRADUATED WITH A B SOUTH IN PHYSICS IN I HAD 2 YEARS OF RESEARCH EXPERIENCE AND I'D WORKED A NORMAL SALARIED IT JOB FOR YEARS BEFORE GOING TO SCHOOL

SINCE THAT TIME I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND A SINGLE FULL-TIME JOB ANYWHERE MUCH LESS IN PHYSICS I HAVEN'T HAD A SINGLE INTERVIEW FOR ANY PHYSICS JOB AT ALL

THE JOBS I'VE HELD HAVE BEEN

CONTRACTING DATA ENTRY POSITION

CONTRACTING EXCEL SPREADSHEET MONKEY

PART-TIME MATH TUTOR

CONTRACTING PROGRAMMER

EVEN WITH A PHYSICS DEGREE GETTING JOBS IN FIELDS OF ENGINEER STATISTICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE THEY FRANKLY DON'T THINK YOU'RE QUALIFIED WITH YOUR PHYSICS DEGREE
WHAT ABOUT THE SCHRDINGER EAT FOR A PARTICLE IN WITH POTENTIAL X 2 BASICALLY

2 I X 2 I E I

WHERE I IS A CONSTANT I'VE BEEN TOLD THIS ADMITS BOUND NORMALIZABLE STATES IFF I DOES ANYONE KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS OR HAS A REFERENCE FOR HOW THIS RESULT IS PROVEN
SO I AM IN HIGH SCHOOL AND I'M TAKING A PHYSICS CLASS WHERE I'VE TAKEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO AN EXTRA CREDIT PROJECT I AM ALSO CURRENTLY READING A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME AND SO DECIDED TO USE SOMETHING THAT I HAVE LEARNED FROM THERE FOR MY PROJECT THINKING I KIND OF GRASPED THE CONCEPT AND COULD JUST DO SOME MORE RESEARCH TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT IT I ASKED TO WORK ON STARS BLACK HOLES AND ANTIMATTER FROM MY UNDERSTANDING FROM WHAT I'VE READ IN THE BOOK WHICH NOW I THINK MAY HAVE TOTALLY BEEN OFF TRACK STARS ARE FORMED BY PARTICLES AND ANTIPARTICLES THAT ARE HELD TOGETHER BY GRAVITY RUNNING INTO EACH OTHER BASICALLY EXPLODING AND LETTING OFF HEAT THAT WE CAN SEE WAS I TOTALLY OFF ON THIS UNDERSTANDING I'VE BEEN GOOGLING BUT CAN'T FIND ANY SITES OR RESOURCES I TRUST THAT SEEM TO BE SAYING THIS


ANYWAYS BASICALLY ANY INFORMATION OR RESOURCES THAT WILL HELP ME BETTER UNDERSTAND ANTIMATTER AND STAR AND BLACK HOLE FORMATION WOULD BE SUPER DUPER APPRECIATED

ALSO SORRY IF I SEEM IGNORANT OR DUMB WHILE THIS STUFF ABSOLUTELY FASCINATES ME AND I LOVE LEARNING ABOUT IT IT IS VERY HARD FOR ME TO GRASP AND I DON'T THINK I REALLY HAVE THE BRAIN CAPACITY FOR IT SO REALLY ANY HELP OR INFORMATION WOULD BE AWESOME
WHEN COVERING THE HYDROGEN ATOM IN QUANTUM MECHANICS THE POTENTIAL IS SPHERICALLY SYMMETRIC I EAST IT ONLY DEPENDS ON ROYAL SO WHY IS THAT WE CAN'T JUST TAKE THE WAVE FUNCTION TO ONLY BE A FUNCTION OF R AS WELL WE CAN DO THAT FOR OTHER SPHERICALLY SYMMETRIC PROBLEMS SO WHY NOT HERE
WOULD ENTANGLED RADIOACTIVE ATOMS DECAY AT THE SAME TIME
WHEN A STAR BEGINS TO COLLAPSE ELEMENTS FUSE INTO HIGHER ELEMENTS UNTIL IT REACHES LEAD WHERE IT STALLS WHY WHAT IS IT ABOUT LEAD THAT TEMPORARILY HALTS THIS PROCESS
CAN SOMEONE CONCEPTUALLY EXPLAIN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TANGENTIAL VELOCITY AND CENTRIPETAL ACCELERATION

FOR EXAMPLE UNIFORM CIRCULAR MOTION IS DEFINED AS AN OBJECT MOVING AT A CONSTANT SPEED IN A CIRCULAR PATHOLOGY LET'S SAY V S BUT IS ALWAYS CHANGING DIRECTION WHILE RADIUS IS 2 MASCULINE WHEN WE PLUG IT INTO THE EQUATION FOR CENTRIPETAL ACCELERATION A V 2 R WE GET M S SOUTH WHAT DOES THIS REALLY MEAN THE CENTRIPETAL ACCELERATION HAS NO IMPACT ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE TANGENTIAL VELOCITY BUT WHAT EXACTLY IS INCREASING BY M S PER SECOND
COULD WE EVER OBSERVE OR AT THE VERY LEAST MODEL GRAVITY STRONG ENOUGH TO TEAR APART HADRONS WOULD THIS ONLY BE POSSIBLE INSIDE A BLACK HOLE MEANING OUTSIDE OF WHAT WE CAN ACTUALLY MEANINGFULLY TALK ABOUT

IF IT IS POSSIBLE THEN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE QUARKS WOULD THEIR COLOR CHARGES BE RANDOMLY LOCKED OR WOULD THEY CARRY INDIVIDUAL UNCERTAINTY
CAN A LIQUID SUBSTANCE THAT CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY EXPERIENCE A NET ELECTRIC FIELD INSIDE OF IT WITHOUT A CURRENT PASSING THROUGH SO FAR EVERYWHERE I'VE SEARCHED HAS STATED THAT THE NET ELECTRIC FIELD INSIDE A CONDUCTOR IS ALWAYS ZERO BECAUSE THAT IS WHEN THE CHARGES IN THE CONDUCTOR WILL STOP BEING POLARIZED IS THERE ANY SORT OF LIMIT TO THIS CAN THE STRENGTH OF THE APPLIED FIELD BE RAISED HIGH ENOUGH TO EXCEED A CONDUCTOR'S ABILITY TO COMPLETELY NEGATE IT INTERNALLY
HYPOTHETICALLY HOW WOULD WE GO ABOUT CREATING A MACHINE THAT INSTEAD OF MINIMIZING GRAVITY MAXIMIZES GRAVITATIONAL FORCE WITHOUT USING A CENTRIFUGE AND BASED ON OF THE EFFECT OF GRAVITY ON OUR BODIES HOW WOULD THE ADDITIONAL GRAVITY EFFECT OUR BODIES WOULD OUR MUSCLES CONTINUOUSLY TEAR UP AND HEAL ARTIFICIALLY CREATING NEW MUSCLE GROWTH
I'M WRITING A SCI-FI SCREENPLAY AND AM TRYING TO GET THE PHYSICS RIGHT MY MAIN QUESTIONS EVOLVE AROUND THE TOPIC OF IF X HAPPENS TO EARTH WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS ON GRAVITY ORBIT SEA LEVELS ETC WHERE CAN I FIND THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO ASK WOULD R ASKPHYSICS BE APPROPRIATE
IF YOU ARE IN A ROOM THAT IS TEMPERATURE ABSOLUTE ZERO DOES SOUND STILL EXIST
I APOLOGISE IN ADVANCE FOR MY LANGUAGE BUT WHAT THE FLIP IS MOMENTUM SPACE
HI I JUST WATCHED THE MOVIE ARRIVAL AND THE FRIEND I WATCHED IT WITH CLAIMS THAT IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE THE PRINCIPLE OF LEAST ACTION HE USED THE ANALOGY OF A RAY OF LIGHT BENDING UNDER WATER TO SAY THAT THE LIGHT CHOOSES THE PATH OF LEAST ACTION TO GET FROM POINT A TO POINT B SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS DOES THIS PRINCIPLE OF LEAST ACTION IMPLY ANY VIOLATION OF CAUSALITY DOES THE LIGHT SOMEHOW KNOW AHEAD OF TIME WHICH PATH TO TAKE AND TAKE THAT OR IS THIS JUST ANOTHER WAY OF THINKING OF CLASSICAL MECHANICS
SO I'M IN HIGH SCHOOL PHYSICS AND I CAN'T QUITE FIGURE OUT A CONCEPT SHOULD THE FORCE OF GRAVITY ON EARTH DUE TO THE MOON BE EQUAL TO THE FORCE OF GRAVITY BETWEEN THEM THIS IS THE ONLY WAY I CAN THINK OF CALCULATING IT BUT IT JUST REALLY DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT
WHAT EXACTLY IS NONLINEAR GRAVITATIONAL CLUSTERING
THE ONLY SUGGESTION I CAN MAKE IS TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS LOCATED IN THE SAME CITY

FINDING A POSTDOCTORAL POSITION AT ALL CAN BE FRUSTRATINGLY DIFFICULT WITHOUT PLACING RESTRICTIONS ON YOURSELF
HAPPENED TO SEVERAL OF MY FRIENDS NO PROBLEM YOU JUST HAVE TO SEARCH VERY ACTIVELY I HAD ONE COUPLE OF FRIEND THAT HAD TO WAIT MONTH BEFORE BEING ABLE TO WORK ON THE SAME CITY

I SAW THIS WORKING OUT IN MASSACHUSETTS TEXAS NORWAY AND FRANCE SO IT IS POSSIBLE BASICALLY ANYWHERE

THE PROBLEM IS ALWAYS AT THE CORE OF A PHYSICS CAREER IT'S PRETTY HARD TO GET IT RIGHT I ONLY FINISHED MY PHD A FEW YEARS AGO BUT THE ONLY PEOPLE I KNOW WHO STILL LIVE IN THE SAME PLACE WITH THEIR SAME SO ARE THOSE WHO HAD SOS THAT WERE FLEXIBLE IN THEIR CAREER OR STAY AT HOME THAT BEING SAID THERE WERE SOME WHO WERE BOTH PHYSICISTS AND STILL TOGETHER BUT NONE LIVE IN THE SAME CITY HOUR DRIVE IS THE CLOSEST I'VE SEEN
YOU WOULD BE WISE TO TAKE STEPS TO REDUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS COMING DOWN TO RANDOM CHANCE
I WOULD WANT TO BREAK UP OVER A POST DOC POSITION

ODDS ARE PRACTICALLY NIL YOU CAN ENJOY SINGLE LIFE AGAIN SOON WITHOUT IT BEING YOUR FAULT YOU BROKE UP
EVERY PAPER YOU READ ASSUMES THAT YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE SUCCESSES OF PREVIOUS PAPERS

THERE ARE MANY SUCCESSES HERE

THE OBVIOUS ONE IS LSS STARTING WITH LAMBDACISM PEOPLE THEN DO LARGE COMPUTATIONAL SIMULATIONS OF LSS AND CHECK HOW IT IS SIMILAR TO CATALOGS BUILT UP FROM OBSERVATIONS COMPARING THEM IS TRICKY DUE TO BIASES IN THE CATALOGS DETAILS OF THE SIMULATIONS AND THE PRESENCE OF BARYONIC PHYSICS PEOPLE ARE WORKING TO SORT OUT THESE PROBLEMS BUT IN GENERAL THE DATA AGREE WITH LAMBDACISM A FACT THAT IS ENTIRELY UNCLEAR WITHOUT THE SIMULATIONS

THIS IS JUST ONE OF MANY EXAMPLES

ALSO PREDICTING THE WEATHER TO A RIDICULOUS DEGREE I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE BUT MOST PLACES AREN'T ACCURATE MORE THAN A FEW DAYS TO A WEEK OUT BEYOND THAT THE STEADY STATE SOLUTION IS USUALLY COMPARABLE ON THE OTHER HAND WE RUN UNIVERSE SIMULATIONS SPANNING BILLIONS OF YEARS AND DO PRETTY WELL
THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FIELDS YOU'RE MENTIONING AND COMPUTATIONAL COSMOLOGY THESE OTHER FIELDS ARE FAR LESS RETROSPECTIVE IF YOU'RE SIMULATING THE WEATHER YOU'RE GONNA KNOW PRETTY SOON IF IT YOUR RESTED MODEL WAS WRONG SAME IF YOU'RE BUILDING A BAD AIRPLANE OR MAKING A BAD DRUG COSMOLOGICAL SIMULATIONS FOLLOW ALMOST THE OPPOSITE PATH OF HERE'S AN EFFECT NO MODEL CAN EXPLAIN CAN YOU COME UP WITH ONE WHAT IF XYZ WAS THE EXPLANATION WHICH ARGUABLY IS LESS SCIENTIFIC WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO IT BUT FAR FROM USELESS

AS AN ASIDE A BETTER COMPARISON WOULD BE WITH EG THE FIELD OF LATTICE CD WHERE PARTICLE PHYSICIST START OFF KNOWING THE RULES THEY WANT TO INCLUDE THE MASSES OF FUNDAMENTAL PARTICLES AND ATTEMPT TO REPRODUCE THEIR ALREADY MEASURED INTERACTION RATES YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO TELL IF THE MODEL YOU ASSUMED FLIES BUT ONLY DOWN TO STATEMENTS LIKE SO WE REALLY NEED X Y DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND Z AND T ARE DEGENERATE

THAT BEING SAID THERE ARE CERTAINLY CASES WHERE COSMOLOGICAL SIMULATIONS HAVE PREDICTED VALUES FOR CONSTANTS WE HAVE NO WAY OF MEASURING DIRECTLY

ALBERTO SIMULATIONS OF THE FOREST
PDF
PDF

THE PHYSICS OF GAS IN THE INTERGALACTIC MEDIUM ARE WELL UNDERSTOOD ENOUGH TO ALLOW VERY FINE COMPARISON TO DATA AND MEASURE THINGS LIKE THE JEANS SCALE SCALE WHICH IS NOT SOMETHING WE COULD MEASURE DIRECTLY SIMULATIONS TELL US THAT A SMALLER SCALE WOULD RESULT IN SHARPER FEATURES WHICH ARE NOT SEEN

SAME GOES FOR THE TEMPERATURE OF GAS IN THE IGM NOT ONLY DO COMPARISONS OF DATA TO SIMULATED LINES OF SIGHT WORK IT HAS EVEN EXCLUDED MODELS OF WARM DARK MATER

JULIEN HYDRODYNAMICAL SIMS COMPARED TO DSS III DATA
ABS

THIS IS AGAIN BECAUSE THE PHYSICS OF INTERGALACTIC GAS AT THOSE EPOCHS IN THE UNIVERSE HAVE BECOME VERY WELL UNDERSTOOD

AND WHILE WE'RE AT IT LET'S MENTION

ALL OF THE PLANCK DATA
PDF LARGE

WHERE THEY HAVE MEASURED THINGS LIKE THE TOTAL MATTER CONTENT OF THE UNIVERSE ITS AGE CONSTRAINTS ON THE MASS OF DARK MATTER PARTICLES CURVATURE OF THE UNIVERSE ETC BY PRODUCING SIMULATED CB MAPS THEN COMPARING TO THE REAL ONE SIMS ARE A NECESSARY PART OF CB COSMOLOGY BECAUSE THE EQUATIONS INVOLVED ARE
AND BEFORE YOU SAY THAT THESE VALUES ARE ALL A SOME ARE CONSISTENT ACROSS MANY MODELS AND B THAT'S HOW SCIENCE GOES LCD HAS ESTABLISHED ITSELF AS THE BEST MODEL WE HAVE BY FAR IN TERMS OF HOW MANY PHENOMENA IT EXPLAINS AND THE ACCURACY TO WHICH IT DOES SO DETAILS OF LCD WILL DEFINITELY BE REFINED WITH TIME BUT THOSE PARAMETER MEASURES ARE ROBUST TO THOSE SMALL ADDITIONS

BUT MAYBE YOU MEANT A DIFFERENT KIND OF COSMOLOGICAL SIMULATION AS NONE OF THE ONE I'VE MENTIONED SO FAR USE PHYSICS TO ANY NOTICEABLE EXTENT

SIMULATIONS OF REIONISATION DO PRODUCE VERIFIABLE AND DISPROVABLE PREDICTIONS

SIMULATIONS WHICH PREDICT THE CM BACKGROUND WILL BE TESTED ONCE WE MEASURE IT WITHIN THE NEXT YEARS NO LINK HERE BECAUSE OF THEM COME OUT PER WEEK

SIMULATIONS OF REIONISATION THE SOURCES RESPONSIBLE FOR IT AND RADIATIVE TRANSFER ARE TESTABLE AND ALREADY BEING TESTED TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE COMPETING MODELS OF

CHARDIN

DAVIES FURLANETTO



THESE THREE MODELS WERE ALL MOTIVATED BY OBSERVATION THE FACT THAT THE FOREST IS CORRELATED ON ENORMOUS SCALES EVEN AFTER REIONISATION HAS ENDED THIS WAS EXTREMELY UNEXPECTED SO THESE GROUPS ALL THEORISED PROCESSES WITH WHICH IT COULD HAPPEN RAN SIMULATIONS AND CONCLUDED THEIR MODELS WERE VIABLE

NOW THESE MODELS USE VERY DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS TO MAKE IT WORK RARE QUASARS MEAN FREE PATH EFFECTS ARISING NATURALLY FROM A LARGE ENOUGH BOX SIZE AND TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATIONS THESE ARE ALL INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE QUASARS SHOULD DEFINITELY BE OBSERVABLE THE OTHER 2 MODELS MAKE OPPOSITE PREDICTION ON WHERE EARLY GALAXIES ARE LOCATED WITH RESPECT TO THE MOST REGIONS IN A DRIVEN MODEL GALAXIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOW OPACITY SO SHOULD BE FOUND TO CORRELATE WITH THOSE REGIONS IN A MODEL THE PARTS RECOGNISED EARLY AND THE LOW OPACITY IS WHERE THE GAS IS STILL HOT SO THE GALAXIES ARE LOCATED IN THE HIGH OPACITY REGIONS

THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE I'M FAMILIAR WITH AND THIS POST IS GETTING LONG THERE ARE TONS OF SIMILAR EXAMPLES WHERE DIFFERENT SIMULATED MODELS EXPLAIN X PHENOMENON BUT DIFFER IN TESTABLE RESPECTS FROM BARYONIC FEEDBACK TO BLACK HOLE GROWTH FEEL FREE TO ASK ME ABOUT IT IF YOU WANT

BLDR WHAT HAVE WE LEARNT THE UNIVERSE IS BY OLD DARK MATTER IS NOT WARM THE JEANS SCALE OF IGM HYDROGEN AT Z IS ABOUT KPC AND TO EXPLAIN X WE NEED EITHER Y OR G NOT Z AND B DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE WE'LL KNOW BETTER WHEN THE OBSERVATIONS ARE MADE
YES IT HAS SIMULATIONS ARE THE BEST WAY WE KNOW TO TEST OUR THEORIES AGAINST OBSERVATION I'M WORKING ON A MODIFIED HYDRODYNAMIC SIMULATION OF DARK MATTER THAT MATCHES CLOSELY TO OBSERVED LARGE SCALE BEHAVIOR SIMULATIONS ARE ALSO ESSENTIAL IN GALAXY FORMATION RESEARCH SIMULATED COSMIC RAY FEEDBACK AND OTHER FEEDBACK MECHANISMS HAVE GIVEN US A CLEARER PICTURE OF THE MECHANISMS OF GALAXY FORMATION
THERE SEEMS TO BE HARDLY ANY WAY TO REALISTICALLY VALIDATE THE SIMULATION RESULTS

THAT'S NOT TRUE TAKE RADIATIVE TRANSFER FOR EXAMPLE WHICH IS REALLY THEORY NOT SOMETHING STUDIED BY THESE SIMULATIONS BUT ANYWAY WITH A LARGE COSMOLOGICAL HYDRODYNAMICAL SIMULATION THAT HAS BEEN SET UP FOR RADIATIVE TRANSFER WE CAN COMPARE IT TO THE LYMAN ALPHA FOREST IN THE REAL UNIVERSE BY MAKING MOCK OBSERVATIONS WE CAN STUDY THE COLUMN DENSITY DISTRIBUTION THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE DOPPLER PARAMETER DISTRIBUTION THE CLUSTERING WITH OTHER TRACERS THE POWERSPECTRUM THE METALLICITY OF THE LINES TRENDS WITH COLUMN DENSITY CLUSTERING THE LYMAN ALPHA FOREST IS ONE OF THE MOST INFORMATION RICH EXAMPLES BUT IT'S NOT LIKE THERE IS A LACK OF TESTS FOR THESE SIMULATIONS IN ALL FIELDS EVEN SOMETHING WITH LIKE REIONISATION WHICH IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD YOU STILL HAVE CONSTRAINTS TO MATCH LIKE THE CB CONSTRAINTS AND THE TROUGH AND OTHER DATA ON THE THERMAL HISTORY OF THE IGM UNLIKE SOME OF THE OTHER FIELDS YOU MENTIONED REIONISATION IS AT A POINT WHERE THE GOOD DATA DOESN'T EXIST YET THERE ARE MANY MODELS AND THE DATA WILL DISCRIMINATE WITH FUTURE TESTS LIKE LYMAN ALPHA EMITTERS EXPERIMENTS HIGH REDSHIFT QSO AND ARBS AND HOPEFULLY REIONISATION BUBBLES

SO THESE SIMULATIONS ARE DEFINITELY TESTABLE WHAT ABOUT SUCCESSES WELL THE STANDARD COSMOLOGICAL MODEL TODAY LCD WOULD NOT EXIST WITHOUT SIMULATIONS IT WAS SIMULATIONS WHICH SHOWED HOW STRUCTURE FORMATION WAS POSSIBLE IN A CD UNIVERSE THESE SIMULATIONS WERE MUCH MORE PRIMITIVE THAN THE ONES TODAY BUT EVEN STILL THEY HAD A HUGE IMPACT THE LARGEST COSMOLOGICAL SIMULATIONS TODAY ARE TO TEST LCD TO SEE HOW CLOSELY WE CAN MEASURE PARAMETERS IN THE MODEL HOW TO LOOK FOR DEVIATIONS AWAY FROM STANDARD COSMOLOGY WE CAN MAKE SIMULATIONS WITH A HUNDRED DIFFERENT COSMOLOGIES WE ONLY HAVE ONE UNIVERSE
MODELLING IS NOT AS SKETCHY AS YOU THINK ALTHOUGH THERE EXIST SOME POOR SUBARID MODELS OUT THERE LET'S START WITH AN EXAMPLE OF THE SUBARID MODEL FOR TURBULENCE IN COSMOLOGICAL SIMULATIONS YOU EXCITE TURBULENCE DURING STRUCTURE FORMATION WHICH CASCADES KINETIC ENERGY TO SMALLER AND SMALLER SCALES WE CANNOT RESOLVE THE MICROSCOPIC DISSIPATION SCALE IN THE SIMULATION INSTEAD THE KINETIC ENERGY ARTIFICIALLY BUILDS UP ON THE GRID SCALE HOWEVER THIS CAN BE FIXED BY A SUBARID MODEL THAT REMOVES KINETIC ENERGY ON THE SMALLEST SCALE AND CONVERTS IT TO HEAT ON THE RIGHT TIMESCALE THEN THE SOLUTION GIVES PHYSICALLY THE RIGHT ANSWER AND THERE IS NO FREE PARAMETER IN THIS SUBARID MODEL IT IS CLEAR YOU WANT THIS SUBARID MODEL IN THE SIMULATION TO GET ACCURATE RESULTS

THE GOAL OF SUBARID MODELS IN GENERAL IS TO CREATE OTHER DESCRIPTIONS OF SMALL-SCALE PHYSICS WHICH YOU KNOW IS PRESENT EAST G TURBULENCE SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS BLACK HOLE JETS THIS IS USUALLY DONE BY ACTUALLY RUNNING DETAILED SIMULATIONS OF THE SMALL-SCALE PHYSICS AND THEN BUILDING THE SUBARID MODEL FOR IT THERE IS A LOT OF SUCCESS AS WE MAKE MORE AND MORE OF OUR SUBARID MODELS

EVENTUALLY ALL SUBARID MODELS WILL BE AS WE INFORM THE SUBARID MODELS BY SIMULATIONS OF SMALL PATCHES OF THE SUBARID PHYSICS HOWEVER IT CAN STILL BE VALUABLE TO STUDY AD HOC SUBARID MODELS AS WELL IN ORDER TO RULE OUT CERTAIN CLASSES OF EFFECTIVE SUBARID MODELS FOR EXAMPLE MOMENTUM VS ENERGY DRIVEN GALACTIC FEEDBACK THESE ARE REALLY THE 2 BASIC WAYS YOU CAN IMAGINE GALACTIC FEEDBACK DIFFERENT CLASSES OF FEEDBACK MAY ALWAYS HAVE SPECIFIC EFFECTS ON GALAXIES REGARDLESS OF THE PARAMETERS YOU CHOOSE FOR THEM AND SO IT IS POSSIBLE TO RULE ONE OUT IT IS ALSO NOT TRUE THAT YOU CAN GET ANY ANSWER YOU WANT FROM PHYSICALLY MOTIVATED SUBARID MODELS DESPITE THE PARAMETER SPACE BEING INFINITE FOR EXAMPLE IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CHANGE LARGE-SCALE LYMAN ALPHA FOREST STATISTICS WITH GALAXY FEEDBACK YOU CAN LEARN WHAT ASPECTS OF COSMOLOGY ARE LEAST SUSCEPTIBLE TO ASTROPHYSICAL FEEDBACK AS A RESULT

I ALSO JUST WANT TO SAY AS OTHERS HAVE POINTED OUT THAT COMPUTATIONAL COSMOLOGY HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL AT SHOWING OF WHAT THE REGIME OF STRUCTURE FORMATION LEADS TO VOIDS FILAMENTS COSMIC WEB AND ALSO EXPLAINING THE LYMAN ALPHA FOREST BEFORE SIMULATIONS PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS DUE TO INDIVIDUAL CLOUDS BUT REALLY THE TOPOLOGY IS THE GAS TRACING THE FILAMENTS AND VOIDS EXPLAINING LYMAN ALPHA FOREST OBSERVATIONS IS ONE OF THE ENORMOUS SUCCESSES OF COMPUTATIONAL COSMOLOGY

IN SHORT SUBARID MODELS ARE A VERY REASONABLE THING TO DO TO ACCURATELY CAPTURE SMALL-SCALE PHYSICS IN A SIMULATION AND PEOPLE ARE WORKING ON MAKING THESE SUBARID MODELS
THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS WHERE IF YOU CONSTANTLY MOVE THE GOALPOST OF WHAT COUNTS AS AN ADVANCE IN ORDER TO FIT YOUR NARRATIVE YOUR NARRATIVE WILL ALWAYS BE FIT
ALREADY MENTIONED HERE BUT LET ME ADDENDUM

THE DISTRIBUTION OF GALAXIES ON THE LARGEST SCALE IS A STATISTICAL QUANTITY WHICH DEPENDS ON THE COSMOLOGICAL MODEL IN OTHER WORDS IN A UNIVERSE WHERE DARK MATTER MAKES UP OF THE ENERGY IN THE UNIVERSE THE CLUSTERING OF GALAXIES WILL LOOK DIFFERENT THAN IN A UNIVERSE WHERE DARK MATTER MAKES UP OF THE ENERGY BUDGET SIMULATIONS ALLOW US TO PLAY WITH THINGS LIKE BARYON DARK MATTER OR DARK ENERGY CONTENT AND PIN DOWN WHAT WE EXPECT THESE COMPONENTS TO BE BY COMPARING WITH OBSERVATIONS

THE PROPERTIES OF DARK MATTER CAN ALSO ONLY BE PREDICTED USING SIMULATIONS SINCE THE CLUSTERING ON GALAXY SCALES IS HIGHLY NON LINEAR AND INTRACTABLE ANALYTICALLY THEREFORE WHETHER WE SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR THE LIGHTEST SUPERSYMETRIC PARTICLE OR A STERILE NEUTRINO DEPENDS ON HOW THE DARK MATTER PARTICLE CLUSTERS ITS FREE STREAMING LENGTH OTHER MODIFICATIONS TO CONVENTIONAL PHYSICS LIKE QUINTESSENCE DARK ENERGY OR CHANGING GENERAL RELATIVITY VIA EAST G A FIFTH FORCE HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE CLUSTERING PROPERTIES OF GALAXIES IN THE LARGE SCALE DISTRIBUTION OF MATTER HENCE SIMULATIONS CAN ALSO BE USED TO CONSTRAIN MODIFIED GRAVITY
AS ANOTHER POINT OF INTEREST SIMULATIONS ARE BASICALLY THE ONLY TRUE MEANS TO STUDY COSMOLOGY REHEATING ETC THIS IS BECAUSE PREHEATING AND COSMOLOGY IN GENERAL IS INHERENTLY WHICH PRECLUDES ANY ANALYTIC WORK FROM BEING ABLE TO CAPTURE ALL OF THE RELEVANT OR IMPORTANT PHYSICS THUS SIMULATIONS ARE THE ONLY MEANS TO TRULY STUDY THIS REGIME
YES
GOOGLE SCHOLAR SORTS THINGS BY CITATIONS
YOU SHOULD NOT BE LOOKING FOR PAPERS WHAT YOU WANT IS THE MOST RECENT TOPICAL REVIEW

THERE ARE THINGS LIKE REVIEW OF MODERN PHYSICS AND NATURE REVIEWS AND A DOZEN OTHER SOURCES IT ALL DEPENDS ON FOR CONDENSED MATTER THOUGH IT'S A LITTLE OUT OF DATE I'VE FOUND THIS LIST USEFUL IN THE PAST

READINGTON IWW NETADV
HI THERE HAVE BEEN READING A LITTLE ABOUT COMPLEXITY THEORY HERE AND THERE FOR A WHILE NOW AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUN TO PUT TOGETHER SOME THOUGHTS IN A BLOG POST SHARING HERE IN CASE ANYONE FINDS OF INTEREST
THIS IS COOL TO ME BECAUSE THIS EITHER MEANS THAT THE EARTHQUAKE IN NEW ZEALAND WAS REALLY POWERFUL OR THAT THE INSTRUMENTS IN THE LOC ARE REALLY REALLY SENSITIVE

WHICH IS IT
TRUE STORY BACK IN A COWORKER OF MINE WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO CONNECT SEEMINGLY DISPARATE SEISMIC EVENTS AND AN UNEXPLAINED TEVATRON QUENCH AS FAR AS I KNOW HE WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO CONNECT THESE KINDS OF DOTS EARTH QUAKES AFFECTING HADRON COLLIDES

ARTICLE DECEMBER

ALSO LOOKS LIKE IT DETECTED SOME AFTER SHOCKS TOO HERE IS THE USGS DATA ON IT TOO
I GUESS THE RECENT ITALIAN QUAKES WOULD HAVE BEEN REGISTERED TOO UNLESS THEY HAPPENED DURING A TS
SOURCE WITH THE ACCOMPANYING DESCRIPTION

AN EARTHQUAKE IN NEW ZEALAND M AT UTC ON NOVEMBER LOCAL LOC TIME IS VISIBLE TOGETHER WITH THE EARTH TIDES ON THE MEAN LOC ORBIT HERE EXPRESSED IN RELATIVE ENERGY CHANGE DURING A VERY LONG FILL WITH PROTON AND LEAD ION BEAMS

SOME SLIDES AND A PAPER IN THE SECOND LINK THAT GO INTO MORE DETAIL ABOUT HOW EARTHQUAKES AFFECT THE LOC

EVENT CONTRIBUTIONS
EVENT CONTRIBUTIONS
SO WHAT EXACTLY IS HAPPENING HERE TO DETECT THE EARTHQUAKE AN INCREASE IN COLLISIONS CAUSED BY THE SHAKING OR SOMETHING
I'LL PROBABLY GO GOOGLE IT AFTER THIS BUT IS THERE ANY DATA FROM FIGO
THIS IS PRETTY COOL BUT WHAT I THINK IS COOLER IS THAT THE SINUSOIDAL BACKGROUND FUNCTION IS DUE TO THE TIDES
SO THE LOC CAN BE USED AS AN OVERPOWERED SEISMOGRAPH COOL
CAN ANYBODY EXPLAIN HOW EXACTLY EARTHQUAKES OF VARYING SIZE ARE DISTINGUISHED FROM INTERSTELLAR GRAVITATIONAL WAVES ARE THE EARTHQUAKES SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER THAN THE SAY A BLACK HOLE MERGER EVENT AND IF SO WHAT DISTINGUISHES THOSE FROM OTHER SMALL SEISMIC ACTIVITY ON EARTH
HERE IS PART 2 OF THE VIDEO WHERE A SIMPLE DERIVATION OF THE SCHRODINGER EQUATION IS GIVEN
WELL THE CLIPPING IN AUDIO SIGNALS IS DUE TO YOU SATURATING AN AMPLIFIER AT SOME POINT IN THE SIGNAL CHAIN AT SOME FREQUENCY BAND IF YOU HAD AN OPTICAL AMPLIFIER AND INPUT A SOURCE WITH SOME BAND IN FREQUENCY YOU COULD SEE CLIPPING BY SEEING THE OUTPUT OF THE BEAM HAVING A DIFFERENT COMPOSITION IN TERMS OF THE INTENSITY OF THE VARIOUS FREQUENCIES OF LIGHT IN TERMS OF DOES THE SIGNAL SHAPE GET CHANGED IN THE TIME DOMAIN I SUPPOSE IT SHOULD THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT YOUR AMPLIFYING MEDIUM WOULDN'T OUTPUT A DIFFERENT BEAM PROFILE SAY NON GAUSSIAN COMPARED TO A GAUSSIAN INPUT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE HARD EDGES IN ANY DISTORTED WAVEFORM SINCE LIGHT IS WELL A WAVE AORTA AND DIFFRACTION EFFECTS WILL ALWAYS ROUND OUT ANY INTENSITY PROFILE YOU MAY HAVE
IN CLIPPING DISTORTION IS THE GENERATION OF HARMONICS SOME PROCESS TAKES SOME OF THE ENERGY AWAY FROM THE FUNDAMENTAL FREQUENCY AND PUTS IT INTO HARMONIC FREQUENCIES THAT ARE MULTIPLES OF THE FUNDAMENTAL IN AN AUDIO AMPLIFIER THIS HAPPENS BECAUSE THE AMPLIFIER DOES THINGS WHEN IT IS ASKED TO AMPLIFY TOO MUCH

AN ANALOGOUS EFFECT FOR LIGHT WAVES IS RELATED TO EFFECTS AS WELL YOU'D NEVER BE ABLE TO CLIP A LIGHT WAVE LIKE A SOUND SIGNAL THE FREQUENCY IS FAR TOO HIGH HZ FOR ANY ELECTRONICS TO HANDLE HOWEVER CRYSTALS HAVE A DIELECTRIC RESPONSE TO EM FIELDS AND SO THEY GENERATE LIGHT AT HIGHER HARMONICS SEE THIS ITS THE PRIMARY WAY THAT YOU GET A GREEN BEAM OR A UV BEAM FROM A IR LASER
NOTHING HANDED IN MY THESIS AND GETTING HAMMERED NOW

OH AND TEACHING MATH TO FRESHMEN
I'M CURRENTLY IN SINGAPORE TRYING TO FINISH SOME PAPERS WITH MY SUPERVISOR WHO'S BEEN HERE SINCE JUNE AND SOME OTHER COLLABORATORS HERE NEXT WEEK I'M GIVING A TALK AT THE TOKYO UNIVERSITY OF AGRICULTURE AND TECHNOLOGY
SAME AS ALWAYS PARTICLE PHYSICS IST STILL MY FAVORITE LECTURE OVER SOLID STATE PHYSICS AND THERMODYNAMICS STATISTICAL MECHANICS

WE HAVE TO HAND IN OUR FIRST LAB REPORT THIS FRIDAY JUST HAVE TO ADD A FEW SENTENCES TO THE CONCLUSION WHICH IS BASICALLY THAT WE GOT A BUNCH OF RESULTS SOME ARE CLOSE TO WHAT THEY SHOULD BE SOME ARENT AT ALL WE DONT REALLY KNOW AHOY BUT IT IS MOST LIKELY THE PRETTY OLD EQUIPMENT

WE GOT THE DATA FOR THE SECOND EXPERIMENT AND IT LOOKS MPH WE GET MICRO SECONDS AS THE LIFETIME OF LYONS DEPENDING ON WHICH METHODE WE USE TO CALCULATE IT WITH THE ACTUAL ONE BEING AT MICROSECONDS

THE ONE EXPERIMENT THAT WE DID LAST FRIDA WAS THE LONGEST ONE WE HAD SO FAR BUT ALSO THE ONE WHERE WE LEARNED THE MOST WE CLEANED A TUNGSTEN SAMPLE AND USED LEED TO CHECK IF IT IS CLEAN TO AFTERWARDS EXAMINE USING PES WHICH WE DIDNT WE JUST GOT DATA FOR A CRYSTAL AND ARE SUPPOSED TO SAY A COUPLE WORDS ABOUT IT
HEY

WORKING ON OPTICAL SIMULATIONS FOR NOW OF A TANDEM SOLAR CELL THAT PROMISES EFFICIENCY AT LOW COST GOT SOME NICE RESULTS ALREADY USING AN EVA DIOXIDE STACK IN-BETWEEN THE TOP AND BOTTOM CELLS BUT I AM NOT FULLY HAPPY YET I AM WORKING ON DESIGNING SOME MIE RESONATORS NANOWIRES TO BETTER FILTER AND TRANSMIT LONG WAVELENGTH PHOTONS TO THE SILICON ALSO TRYING TO INCORPORATE SOME PATHLENGTH ENHANCEMENT FACTOR INTO MY SIMULATIONS TO GET RESULTS CLOSER TO REALITY EXCITED ABOUT FINISHING THIS SO I CAN GO AND START BUILDING IT
WORKING ON ANTIPROTON BACKGROUNDS FOR THE EXPERIMENT FERMILAB THE GROUP IS DOING SOME SIMULATIONS
ONE WORD SCIHUB


IF IO IS BLOCKED TRY CC

USE DOI

DON'T ASK QUESTIONS HERE ASK THEM HERE INSTEAD OR ON R QUANTUMJOURNAL ONCE THE AMA IS OVER
SHOULD WE BE CAREFUL ABOUT THE CONCLUSIONS

I AM DOING A PHD IN CFD AND STUDY THE BEHAVIOR OF BLOOD IN THE HUMAN HEART WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT ARE THE PROPER UNDERSTAND MOST ACCURATE MODEL TO USE AND NUMEROUS PAPER INVESTIGATE THE USE OF DIFFERENT MODELS SHOWING ESSENTIALLY NOTHING NOVEL THAT WE UNDERSTAND NOTHING

IN PARTICULAR THE LAST PAPER OF THE KIND I READ WAS INVESTIGATING THE NUMEROUS NON NEWTONIAN MODEL AND SHOWING THAT THE VORTICAL STRUCTURES CHANGED YOU DON'T SAY

WHAT MY POINT IS CFD ALONE IS NOT A GOOD TOOL CFD NEEDS TO BE VALIDATED AGAINST SIMILAR EXPERIMENTS IN MY FIELD WE CALL CFD SIMULATIONS COLORFUL FLUID DYNAMICS

THAT SAID I AM NOT AN EXPERT OF THE SPECIFIC FIELD SO IT COULD BE POSSIBLE THAT THIS VALIDATION HAS BEEN DONE ALREADY
I'M NOT IN THE FIELD OF PLASMA PHYSICS I'M A MATERIALS SCIENTIST SO I'M NOT ALTOGETHER SURE IF ANYONE HAS READ THE LINKED PAPER DO YOU THINK THESE VORTEX STATES COULD HAVE TOPOLOGICAL STABILITY
SEEMS SELF EXPLANATORY
GREAT USE OF RESOURCES LOVE IT
THE OBJECT HEIGHT IS FIXED AT YOU CAN ADJUST THE FOCAL LENGTH F THE OBJECT DISTANCE O AND THE CURVATURE OF THE LENS A
VERY GOOD JOB A COUPLE OF COMMENTS THAT YOU MAY FIND FUN TO IMPLEMENT

DRAWING THE VIRTUAL RAYS TO SEEM THEM CONVERGE AT THE VIRTUAL IMAGE LOCATION DASHED LINES OR SOMETHING

2 ADD A MODE WHERE THE TWO RADII OF CURVATURE AND INDEX OF REFRACTION CAN BE CHANGED SEPARATELY RATHER THAN JUST CHANGING THE OVERALL FOCAL LENGTH

AFTER 2 ADD SUPPORT FOR CHANGING THE INDEX OF REFRACTION OF THE SURROUNDING MEDIUM USE EQUATION THEN ONE COULD SEE HOW THE NORMAL CONVEX CONVERGING RULE GETS FLIPPED WITH A LENS MADE OF AIR THAT IS PUT UNDERWATER

ADD SUPPORT FOR DIFFERENT INDICES OF REFRACTION OF THE MATERIAL OUTSIDE OF THE LENS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE LENS LENSES WITH AIR ON ONE SIDE AND WATER ON THE OTHER SIDE FOR EXAMPLE

DON'T KNOW HOW CAPABLE THE LANGUAGE IS BUT ADD SUPPORT FOR DISPERSION DIFFERENT FOCAL LENGTHS FOR DIFFERENT COLORS OF LIGHT ONE COULD SEE CHROMATIC ABERRATIONS

AGAIN GREAT TOOL THANKS FOR SHARING
CAN I SHARE A PHYSICS BASED DEIMOS THING IT ISN'T COMPLETE BUT THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE I CAN'T DEAL WITH THE HUGE AMOUNT OF NUMBERS INVOLVED
I USE MY NAILS TO SCRATCH SYMBOLS ONTO A ROCK
CHALK ALWAYS
I DON'T FEEL ANY BETTER AT DOING PROBLEMS BUT I ENJOY FINE WRITING UTENSILS AND IT CAN BE A SMALL MOTIVATING FACTOR IN DOING MY WORK I USE THE ROARING

EDIT NOT 3M
I USE A PILOT ROLLER BALL ON UNLINED PAPER TO DO IDEA GENERATION BASE IDEA IN A CENTER CIRCLE WITH GOING OFF IN ALL DIRECTIONS LIKE SPOKES OF A WHEEL
I LIKE TO DO ALL OF MY WORK IN LATEX IN A GOOD EDITOR LIKE WINED ITS A HUGE HELP TO BE ABLE TO COPY PASTE LONG FORMULAS AND THEN JUST CHANGE THE PARTS YOU WANT TO SIMPLIFY ALSO I'D DIE WITHOUT THE FEATURES

PLUS YOU DON'T HAVE TO IT OUT OF A NOTEBOOK TO GET IT LOOKING GREAT
RED PILOT
BLACK BLUE PILOT ALWAYS
PYTHON DOWNLOAD ANACONDA PROFIT
C BECAUSE I USE ROOT AND BEANT A LOT
FORTRAN YES REALLY IF YOU'RE DOING ANY SORT OF BIG MATHS FORTRAN IS COMPLETELY UNBEATABLE

PLUS IT'S COME ON A LONG WAY MODERN FORTRAN EVEN ALLOWS LOWERCASE LETTERS
MY FAVORITE LANGUAGE PROBABLY C CUDA I USE IT ALL THE TIME FOR RESEARCH AND IT'S GROWING ON ME

THE LANGUAGE I WANT TO LIKE THE MOST JULIA IT'S AN UP-AND-COMING JIT COMPILED LANGUAGE THAT HAS THE SIMPLICITY OF PYTHON BUT BOASTS OF SPEEDS CLOSER TO C IF YOU WRITE WELL OPTIMIZED CODE I WOULD DEFINITELY SUGGEST TAKING A LOOK AT IT IF YOU ARE INTERESTED
LISP IS MY FAVORITE BECAUSE I CAN WRITE A SINGLE EXPRESSION AS MY ENTIRE CODE IT FEELS LIKE WHEN YOU WRITE A COMPLEX PHYSICS EQUATION USING ONLY SI BASE UNITS

THOUGH AS FAR AS USEFULNESS IN PHYSICS I USE MATALAN AND FORTRAN THE MOST
I LOVE PYTHON THE WAY IT IS WRITTEN JUST MAKES SENSE TO ME MOST OF THE TIME I AM USING MATALAN HOWEVER FOR IMAGE PROCESSING AND VECTORIZED CODE IS PRETTY NEAT IMO
SURPRISED TO NOT SEE ANY HASKELL PEOPLE HERE YET
PYTHON FOR BASHING THINGS OUT THAT I WANT TO KEEP BUT MODIFY OR UNIX STUFF ANSI C FOR QUICK AND DIRTY OR ALDUINO
PYTHON ABSOLUTELY AND COTHON IF IT EVER GETS TOO SLOW WHICH IS RARE
DON'T KNOW IF IT'S MY FAVORITE LANGUAGE YET BUT RUST HAS A LOT OF PROMISE SPEED OF C TYPE SYSTEM SIMILAR TO HASKELL SAFETY LIKE NOTHING ELSE AND IN MANY CASES THE CONVENIENCE OF PYTHON IT STILL NEEDS SOME WORK THOUGH THE COMPILER IS SLOW AND THERE AREN'T A LOT OF LIBRARIES AVAILABLE THE LANGUAGE ITSELF IS STILL GROWING AND CHANGING FAIRLY RAPIDLY TOO
I LOVE HASKELL MOST FOR PROGRAMMING BY A LONG SHOT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REASONS FROM A CONCEPTUAL STANDPOINT IT MESHES MUCH MORE NICELY WITH OUR MENTAL THEORETICAL MODELS OF OUR PROBLEM DOMAIN YOU PROGRAM BY SAYING WHAT THINGS ARE NOT HOW TO GET THEM THE IN HASKELL IS THE EQUALITY OF MATH NOT ASSIGNMENT OF A MUTABLE VARIABLE LIKE IN ALMOST ALL OTHER LANGUAGES A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF THIS MIGHT BE FACTORIAL N PRODUCT N OR DOTPRODUCT V W SUM SKIPWITH V W SUCH CUTE EXAMPLES ONLY VAGUELY GESTURE AT HOW REAL WORLD PROGRAMMING PROCEEDS BUT THEY ARE ILLUSTRATIVE BESIDES BEING A MUCH NICER CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK PROGRAMMING WITHOUT OR WITH AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE MUTABLE STATE DOES WONDERS FOR ONE'S ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A PROJECT OVER THE LONG TERM AND TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING WHEN THE COMPLEXITY GETS LARGE

HAVING A MUCH MORE POWERFUL TYPE SYSTEM THAN ANY OTHER LANGUAGE IS ANOTHER HUGE BONUS IT'S LIKE PROGRAMMING WITH A VERY INTELLIGENT ASSISTANT A HUGE MAJORITY OF THE MISTAKES YOU CAN MAKE ARE CAUGHT AT COMPILE TIME AND YOU CAN EXTEND THAT POWER TO LEVERAGE IT FOR YOUR PARTICULAR DOMAIN IN A LOT OF WAYS ONE EXAMPLE RELEVANT TO THIS SUBREDDIT IS THE ABILITY TO STATICALLY ENFORCE CORRECT DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS FOR EXAMPLE AS IMPLEMENTED IN THE DIMENSIONAL PACKAGE

LOOKING FORWARD I'M EXCITED BY THE PROSPECT OF DEPENDENTLY TYPED LANGUAGES WHICH GIVES YOU THE POWER TO DO ARBITRARY FORMAL VERIFICATION OF YOUR PROGRAM AT COMPILE TIME THIS IS VERY NICE FOR ONE EXAMPLE TO ENFORCE THINGS LIKE DIMENSIONS OF TENSORS AND MATRICES WHEN DOING ANY KIND OF MATRIX COMPUTATIONS LANGUAGES BUILT FROM THE GROUND UP FOR THIS APPROACH LIKE IDRIS ARE ESPECIALLY NICE BUT A LOT OF THIS IS BEING BROUGHT IN TO HASKELL AS WELL WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE A FAIR NUMBER OF LIBRARIES WRITTEN IN HASKELL

WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE THE KIND OF MINDSHARE DEVOTED TO MAKING AWESOME SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES AS SAY PYTHON BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF BASICS IN PLACE AND I'D LOVE TO HELP TRY TO MOVE THAT NEEDLE AND ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO DO THE SAME
MY FAVORITE LANGUAGE IN GENERAL IS STILL JAVA FOR ITS LOGIC AND ROBUSTNESS IN BIG PROJECTS BUT IT'S NOT VERY SUITABLE FOR SCIENTIFIC APPLICATIONS FOR WHICH I USE PYTHON
FORTRAN

MODERN FORTRAN IS UNBEATABLE FOR MATHS IT'S ALSO GOT EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO MAKE DYNAMIC DATA STRUCTURES FULL OO CAPABILITIES COARRAYS FOR NATIVE PARALLELISATION OPENMPI SUPPORT IN ALL COMPILERS CUDA IN THE CGI COMPILER AND C INTEROPERABILITY FOR CUDA IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE CGI COMPILER AND WANT TO USE CUDA IT'S ALSO SYNTACTICALLY EASY TO GRASP

IT'S ONLY MISSING TEMPLATES FROM C BUT YOU CAN EMULATE THEM
BASH IS MY SHIT PARDON THE LANGUAGE HOWEVER I USE QUANTUM ESPRESSO FOR MY RESEARCH AND BASH IS A VERY SENSIBLE LANGUAGE FOR ME NOT TOO HARD TO FIGURE OUT AND NOTHING SEEMS UNREASONABLE WITH REGARDS TO CALLABLE FUNCTIONS WOULD RECOMMEND
PYTHON FOR SURE EASY TO LEARN NO DECLARATIONS OF VARIABLE TYPE NEEDED VERY USEFUL FOR THE PROTEIN DYNAMICS RESEARCH I'VE DONE IN THE PAST
MAKE ME FEEL OLD I STARTED IN C AND MOVED TO ASM HEX FOR A FEW PROJECTS I ACTUALLY ENJOY ASSEMBLY AND THE SPEED OF IT IS UNMATCHED BY ANY MODERN LANGUAGE

I DO A LOT OF WORK IN C C NOW I LIKE THE MULTITHREADING AND THE CUDA SUPPORT IS PHENOMENAL
THE LACK OF JAVA IS SURPRISING
I USE MATALAN AS I HAVE A SCHOOL LICENSE AND I CAN PRODUCE PLOTS OF COMPLEX EQUATIONS IN LESS THAN SECONDS
I LIKE PYTHON THE MOST BECAUSE IT'S SO EASY TO USE NOT JUST THE PROCESS OF WRITING CODE BUT I LIKE HOW I CAN JUST RUN THE CODE WITHOUT HAVING TO COMPILE IT ITS BIG DRAWBACK IS THAT IT'S SLOW FORTRAN AND C ARE NECESSARY TO DO LOTS OF LOW-LEVEL COMPUTATIONS QUICKLY AND BOTH OF THEM ARE COMMONLY USED BY PHYSICISTS BUT YOU CAN STILL USE PYTHON FOR HIGH-LEVEL STUFF ESPECIALLY FOR MAKING PLOTS MATPLOTLIB IS THE BEST
DIFFERENT LANGUAGES ARE MEANT FOR DIFFERENT THINGS

I NEED PERFORMANCE SO C I'D WHAT I MOSTLY USE
I'D PROBABLY LIKE TO USE SOMETHING SAFER LIKE RUST BUT HAVE NOT SEEN ENOUGH HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING EXAMPLES IT MAY BE GOOD FOR BROWSERS BUT GETTING A PDE VECTORIZED AND RUNNING FAST IS A DIFFERENT PROBLEM
IN AN IDEAL WORLD I MIGHT USE SOMETHING LIKE HASKELL BUT AS IT NOW STANDS IT'S BASICALLY USELESS FOR APC

IF I'M SHUFFLING DATA AROUND USING SOME EXISTING LIBRARY PYTHON IS NICE AND INTERACTIVE WELL NOT EXACTLY NICE AS THE SYNTAX WAS NEVER DESIGNED FOR PHYSICKY OR ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS BUT IT'S THE BEST CURRENTLY AVAILABLE THANKS TO THE BIG COMMUNITY MATALAN HAS A SUPERIOR SYNTAX AND WAS BUILT FOR ENGINEERS AND JULIA BEING ESSENTIALLY AN OPEN SOURCE ALTERNATIVE TO THE LANGUAGE IS QUITE INTERESTING OCTAVE IS NOT REALLY A LANGUAGE OF ITS OWN BUT AN OPEN SOURCE REPLICA OF SORTS BUT DUE TO THE INHERENT RESTRICTIONS IS NEVER QUITE AS GOOD FAST OR POLISHED AS MATALAN
GROOVY JAVA TIDIED UP
PYTHON FOR ANALYSIS AND FORTRAN FOR BIG ASS FUCKING SIMULATIONS
I MOSTLY USE PYTHON BUT I'VE BEEN USING R A LOT LATELY DOING ASTROPHYSICS IN R IT'S NICE SINCE ITS FAST STATISTICS FUNCTIONS ARE VERY USEFUL TO DEAL WITH A LOT OF TABULATED DATA IT'S SLOWER THAN EVEN PYTHON THOUGH
C OR JAVA DEPENDING ON WHAT I'M DOING C GIVES YOU MORE FREEDOM BUT JAVA IS BUILT BETTER
I'M DIVIDED BETWEEN C AND PYTHON

C PARALLELIZES WITHOUT TOO MUCH TROUBLE RUNS ON EVERYTHING NATIVELY AND IS FAST IF YOU KNOW HOW TO WRITE IT FOR SPEED

PYTHON CAN BE WRITTEN IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE HAS SOME REALLY POWERFUL AND ACCESSIBLE LIBRARIES AND GOOD VISUALIZATION TOOLS ALSO IN LIBRARIES IT'S NOT NEARLY AS FAST FOR HEAVY-DUTY COMPUTATION BUT IT'S DEFINITELY USEFUL FOR SMALLER BITS OF CODE OR FOR GLUING TOGETHER A PROGRAM WHERE THE FAST BITS ARE IN C

MATALAN DESERVES AN HONORABLE MENTION EVERY TIME I USE IT I FIND IT EASY TO WRITE AND IT COMPILES TO C SO IT'S REASONABLY FAST
CLOSURE BECAUSE OF NEANDERTHAL AND COMPASSABILITY
COUNTY IT'S FEATURES ARE POWERFUL ENOUGH THAT IT HAS REPLACED PYTHON FOR ALL APPLICATIONS FOR ME
WIKIPEDIA CAN ACTUALLY BE A GOOD STARTING POINT THE WIKIPEDIA PAGE ON A TOPIC WILL OFTEN CITE SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT PAPERS OR BOOKS ON A TOPIC ONCE YOU'VE IDENTIFIED SOME IMPORTANT PAPERS AND BOOKS YOU CAN WORK YOUR WAY BACKWARDS BY USING GOOGLE SCHOLAR TO FIND MORE RECENT PAPERS THAT CITE THOSE PAPERS

OF COURSE THERE'S NO REAL SUBSTITUTE FOR JUST READING LOTS AND LOTS OF STUFF YOU KNOW YOU'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE WHEN THE PAPERS YOU'RE READING SEEM TO CONSISTENTLY CITE OTHER SOURCES THAT YOU'VE ALREADY LOOKED AT

ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING IN THE PAPERS THAT YOU READ A BIG PART OF LITERATURE REVIEW IS BEING ABLE TO PICK OUT WHAT THE IMPORTANT BITS ARE AND SAVE THE REST FOR LATER BEING ABLE TO DO THAT COMES WITH EXPERIENCE
I'D RECOMMEND IEEE SPECTRUM OR PHYSICS TODAY
MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS IS AS RIGOROUS AS ANY OTHER SUBJECT IN MATHEMATICS
HUH
YES PROOFS IN PHYSICS ARE ALSO RIGOROUS TAKE A LOOK AT ELECTRODYNAMICS EVERY STEP MUST BE MATHEMATICALLY JUSTIFIED IN STATISTICAL PHYSICS FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN PROVE THINGS USING APPROXIMATIONS BUT THAT DOES NOT MAKE THEM LESS RIGOROUS WE USUALLY PROVE THINGS IN THE THERMODYNAMIC LIMIT LARGE NUMBER OF PARTICLES THAT CAN SIMPLIFY SOME PROOFS FOR EXAMPLE PROVING THE CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM IN THE THERMODYNAMIC LIMIT IS MUCH EASIER THAN PROVING IT FOR THE GENERAL CASE BUT THEY STILL MUST BE RIGOROUS PROOFS THINK OF THESE APPROXIMATIONS AS ADDITIONAL CONSTRAINTS
IF YOU CALL SOMETHING A PROOF IN PHYSICS IT BETTER BE COMPLETELY RIGOROUS HOWEVER YOU ALSO HAVE DERIVATIONS ARGUMENTS APPROXIMATIONS AND ESTIMATIONS THAT CAN BE A LOT LESS RIGOROUS YOU JUST DON'T CALL THOSE THINGS PROOFS
DO YOU HAVE LINUX BINARIES ALSO SOURCEFORGE IS STILL A THING
I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT YOUR CODE SO I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE BUT DOING A SOLVER MIGHT BE EASIER THAN YOU THINK

DOES YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HAVE A DISCRETIZATION OF THE HAMILTONIAN OPERATOR IN IT EAST G USING EQUATION IN THE PAPER IF SO YOU'VE DONE ALMOST ALL OF THE WORK THAT YOU NEED TO DO TO SOLVE THE TIME INDEPENDENT EQUATION

IF YOUR DISCRETIZATION IS SMALL ENOUGH I EAST YOUR WAVEFUNCTION IS A VECTOR OF LENGTH A FEW THOUSAND AT MOST THEN TO GET THE TIME INDEPENDENT SOLUTIONS ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TAKE YOUR DISCRETIZED HAMILTONIAN OPERATOR AND THROW IT INTO AN EIGENVALUE SOLVER PACKAGE THE EIGENVALUES WILL BE THE PARTICLE ENERGIES AND THE EIGENVECTORS WILL BE THE WAVEFUNCTIONS I SAY A FEW THOUSAND AT MOST BECAUSE IF IT'S BIGGER THAN THAT YOUR COMPUTER WILL TAKE A LONG TIME TO DO THE CALCULATION

I DON'T KNOW WHAT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE YOU'RE USING BUT WHATEVER IT IS THERE'S ALMOST CERTAINLY A GOOD PACKAGE FOR IT C FOR EXAMPLE HAS A PACKAGE CALLED EIGEN THAT'LL DO WHAT YOU NEED

ALSO IF YOU DO THINGS THIS WAY THEN YOU CAN REIMPLEMENT YOUR SIMULATION TO BE HIGHLY ACCURATE RATHER THAN APPROXIMATING THE TIME EVOLUTION OF THE WAVEFUNCTION YOU CAN EVALUATE IT EXACTLY IF YOU KNOW THE EIGENVALUES AND EIGENVECTORS OF A MATRIX THEN YOU CAN EVALUATE ITS MATRIX EXPONENTIAL DIRECTLY

IF YOUR DISCRETIZATION IS MUCH LARGER THAN THAT THEN YOU CAN STILL GET SOME OF THE TIME INDEPENDENT SOLUTIONS BUT IT TAKES MORE EFFORT YOU'LL HAVE TO WRITE YOUR OWN EIGENVALUE SOLVING ALGORITHM THESE ARE NOT TOO HARD TO YOU CAN LOOK UP SUBSPACE ITERATION ALGORITHM WHICH IS A SIMPLE AND EFFECTIVE METHOD OF FINDING THE GROUND STATE EIGENVECTORS

THIS WHOLE APPROACH IS CALLED DIRECT DIAGONALIZATION FYI

EDIT I'M ALSO ON LINUX SO I CAN'T USE YOUR PROGRAM

I HOPE YOU ARE SOMEHOW JOKING AROUND BUT IF NOT THIS IS A HUGE CAUSE FOR ALARM YOU SHOULD TAKE IT TO ONE OF YOUR PROFESSORS AND ASK FOR ADVICE I WOULD ALSO STAND UP TO THE GRAD STUDENT ABOUT HIS UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR NOT ONLY IS THAT BEHAVIOR COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO SCIENCE BUT THERE ARE OTHER SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES THAT COULD PERMANENTLY HARM YOUR CAREER
EDITING DATA TO GIVE THE RIGHT ANSWER IS A NO NO MAYBE RUN IT BY A COUPLE PROFS AND SUPERVISORS AND SEE WHAT THEY SAY
THIS IS NOT AN ETHICALLY OK THING HAVING A PUBLICATION WITH DOCTORED RESULTS WILL HURT YOUR CARRIER A LOT MORE THAN APPLYING FOR MASTERS WITH NO PUBLICATIONS TALK TO YOUR ADVISOR AND THE PHD STUDENT'S ADVISOR IF THEY ARE DIFFERENT PEOPLE IF YOU GET NO TRACTION WITH EITHER OF THEM TALK TO THE DEPARTMENT CHAIR
SOUNDS FISHY I WOULD SAY CONSULT WITH A PROFESSOR OR SOMEONE EXPERIENCED
TL DR IS IT SOMEWHAT NORMAL TO DOCTOR RESEARCH PAPERS TO UNDO EXPERIMENTAL ERRORS IS THIS AN UNSPOKEN BUT ETHICALLY OK THING

YES AND NUMBER WHEN YOU'RE DOING AN ANALYSIS YOU ALWAYS DO THE ANALYSIS ON DATA POINTS YOU NEVER NEVER NEVER CHANGE THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS WHICH IS WHAT SEEMS TO BE HAPPENING HERE

WHAT YOU CAN DO IS EXCLUDE DATA POINTS FROM THE ANALYSIS IF YOU HAVE GOOD REASON TO SUSPECT THAT THOSE DATA POINTS ARE FAULTY IN SOME WAY IN THAT CASE AT THE VERY LEAST YOU HAVE TO MENTION THAT YOU EXCLUDED DATA POINTS AND WHY YOU EXCLUDED THEM GIVING THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS WITHOUT EXCLUDING DATA POINTS IS ALSO HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AND A GOOD THING TO PUT IN THE SUPPORTING INFORMATION FINALLY DOING AN ANALYSIS WITH A CERTAIN EXPECTATION IS ALWAYS DANGEROUS AND YOU HAVE TO BE FAIRLY CAREFUL TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT JUST REPLICATING YOUR EXPECTATIONS

ONE EXAMPLE FROM MY OWN WORK PERTAINS TO A MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE IN WHICH A BEAM IS REFLECTED OFF A CRYSTAL AND PASSES THROUGH AN ADSORBED LAYER ON THE CRYSTAL ON THE WAY IN AND OUT WE'RE ONLY INTERESTED IN THE PROPERTIES OF THE ADSORBATE LAYER SO WE'LL EXCLUDE MEASUREMENTS ON SPOTS WHERE THE REFLECTIVITY IS DISTORTED BECAUSE IN THAT CASE WE WOULD BE MEASURING DEFECTS IN THE CRYSTAL INSTEAD OF PROPERTIES OF THE ADSORBATE LAYER BUT YOU CANNOT DO THAT WITHOUT MENTIONING IT
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND MENDELEEV FOR SORTING PAPERS

LOTS OF GOOD RESOURCES OUT THERE FOR SIFTING THROUGH PAPERS SCIENCE DIRECT RESEARCHGATE WEB OF SCIENCE BUT WHEN IT'S ALL DONE YOU HAVE DFS AND MENDELEEV EATS DFS AND SPITS OUT KNOWLEDGE DATABASES
MAYBE A BROWSER EXTENSION THAT EASILY LETS YOU DATAGRAM FROM GRAPHS IN PAPERS I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF DATAGRABBING LATELY BY TAKING SCREENSHOTS AND UPLOADING THEM TO A WEBSITE
I LIKE USING JABREF AND OVERLEAF
OVERLEAF MAKES IT SO EASY TO WORK ON A PAPER DRAFT WITH OTHER AUTHORS AMAZING AND IF I'M NOT ON MY USUAL LAPTOP OR PC I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT LATEX INSTALLATIONS ETC

ALSO ONENOTE FROM MICROSOFT REALLY HELPS ME ORGANIZE MY STUFF I HAVE MY NOTES RIGHT NEXT TO MY LAWBOOK AND MY RESEARCH RESULTS AS WELL AS MY LITERATURE OVERVIEWS ETC
IT'S BEEN REALLY HELPFUL THROUGHOUT MY STUDIES ACTUALLY IN THE BEGINNING I JUST SCANNED MY LECTURE NOTES AND EXCERCISE AND PUT THEM IN THERE LATER I BOUGHT A TABLET WITH STYLUS DIGITIZER CAPABILITIES TO JUST TAKE NOTES DIRECTLY INTO ONENOTE AND NOWADAYS I'M BASICALLY ORGANIZING EVERYTHING VIA IT
I CAN'T RECOMMEND SOME APP LIKE ONENOTE OR EVERNOTE ENOUGH ONE OF THE MOST HELPFUL COMPUTER APPLICATIONS AROUND IMO
IS A PRETTY HIGH PITCH NOISE THIS IS JUST A CASE OF INDUCTION
FOR SOME REASON HÜFNER IS USING P I BAR INSTEAD OF P I BAR WHICH GIVES YOU P A I BAR A AND THEREFORE I E I BAR A
PLEASE DEFINE YOUR TERMS WHEN ASKING THESE KINDS OF QUESTIONS MORE INFORMATION MAKES IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO RECOGNIZE WHAT'S GOING ON

THE SIMPLEST REASONS I CAN THINK OF TO CAUSE A SIGN DIFFERENCE WOULD BE THAT I I OR P A A P BUT IF YOU'VE RULED THAT OUT IT THEN IT MIGHT BE THAT YOUR BOOK AND THE PAPER IS USING A DIFFERENT METRIC SIGNATURE IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIGURE IT OUT PRETTY QUICKLY BY CHECKING THE FIRST FEW PAGES OF THE BOOK CHAPTER AND PAPER AS THERE SHOULD BE A SHORT SECTION DETAILING WHICH CONVENTIONS THEY ARE ADHERING TO
YOU MAY WANT TO POST ON PHYSICS STACKEXCHANGE THIS SUB IS MAINLY HIGHSCHOOLERS WHO JUST FIGURED OUT HOW TO USE LAWS OF MOTION
SOUNDS LIKE A BASTARDIZATION OF INFORMATION THEORY
DECODING REALITY BY VLATKO VERBAL
SHOULDN'T THIS BE POSTED IN THE TEXTBOOK RESOURCES THREAD
HOURS HAS GREAT INFORMATION ON HOW YOU CAN USE YOUR CAREER TO HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT MY HOPE FOR YOU IS THAT YOU'LL PURSUE YOUR DREAMS WITH ALL OF YOUR TIME AND ENERGY AND BE REWARDED FOR YOUR EFFORTS PHYSICS IS WONDERFUL AND BEAUTIFUL AND ENLIGHTENING AND IT CAN BE A GREAT CAREER I LOVE MY WORK IN PHYSICS BUT IF IT'S NOT YOUR PASSION YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT IT'S ALSO EXTREMELY DIFFICULT PEOPLE WHO ARE SUCCESSFUL AT PHYSICS PUT IN VERY LONG HOURS CAN WORK FOR LONG PERIODS WITHOUT RESULTS SUFFER AT THE MERCY OF FUNDING AGENCIES CHANGING POLITICAL TIDES AND INEFFECTIVE BOSSES AND LEADERS EVEN AS A STUDENT IT CAN BE MUCH MORE DEMANDING THAN OTHER FIELDS DEPENDING ON YOUR PROGRAM SO IT TAKES QUITE A BIT OF SUSTAINED DEDICATION TO GET ANYWHERE WHERE YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IF YOU DON'T LOVE IT IT WILL BE A BURDEN AND CHORE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WITH DEGREES IN PHYSICS GO ON TO DO WORK OUTSIDE OF PHYSICS IT'S A GREAT PLATFORM FOR LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO SOLVE A WIDE VARIETY OF PROBLEMS AND HOW TO WORK HARD TO UNDERSTAND DIFFICULT CONCEPTS I THINK IT ALSO LOOKS GOOD ON A RESUME FOR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO IN THE FUTURE BUT MY ADVICE IS DON'T DO IT UNLESS YOU LOVE IT
JUST AN EXAMPLE OF HOW PHYSICS CAN BE USED TO PROTECT ANIMALS I RECENTLY READ ABOUT A NEW OPTICAL SPECTROSCOPY TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD TELL BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE CHICKEN EGGS WHICH COULD PREVENT THE MASSIVE SLAUGHTER OF MALE CHICKS
THE THING YOU SEEK DOES NOT EXIST

ANIMAL ACTIVISM DOESN'T NEED OR WANT PHYSICISTS ACTIVISM NEEDS WELL ACTIVISTS AND THEN THE SUPPORT STRUCTURE OF ORGANIZERS LOBBYISTS MANAGERS FUNDRAISERS ETC

THE HOURS LINK POSTED ALREADY IS WORTH YOUR TIME I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT IN PARTICULAR THAT ONE OF THEIR FEATURED SUCCESS STORIES IS ABOUT A GUY IN FINANCE WHO DONATES A TON OF MONEY TO CAUSES HE CARES ABOUT THIS MIGHT NOT SEEM AS FULFILLING AS WORKING FOR THE CAUSE DIRECTLY BUT IT'S ACTUALLY INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT IF IN ADDITION TO SUPPORTING YOURSELF YOU CAN COMPLETELY SUPPORT N WORKER IN THE CAUSE YOU CARE ABOUT YOU'VE ACTUALLY DONE MORE FOR THAT CAUSE THAN YOU COULD HAVE WITH YOUR OWN DIRECT LABOR

ALSO THERE'S THIS TENDENCY TO IMAGINE THAT PEOPLE WHO WORK IN FINANCE OR DEFENSE OR CONSUMER TECHNOLOGY ETC ARE SOMEHOW EVIL WHILE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR ACTIVIST CAUSES ARE PURE AND NOBLE STOP IT THE ONLY WAY ACTIVIST CAUSES FUNCTION AT ALL IS THE SUPPORT OF BASICALLY GOOD PEOPLE WHOSE DAILY WORK IS OUTSIDE OF ACTIVISM
WELL IN TERMS OF AREAS OF PHYSICS IN PARTICULAR THERE ARE SOME AREAS OF BIOPHYSICS THAT FOCUS ON STUFF LIKE BEHAVIOUR OF LARGE GROUPS OF ANIMALS AND THEIR INTERACTION WITH ENVIRONMENT STUFF MIGHT BE WORTH LOOKING INTO IF YOU'RE INTO CONSERVATION A SURPRISING NUMBER OF BIOLOGY RESEARCH GROUPS ACTUALLY LOOK FOR PHYSICISTS TOO BECAUSE WE HAVE NUMERICAL SKILLS THAT A LOT OF THEM HAVEN'T TAKEN THE TIME TO LEARN ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS DOES A LOT OF STUFF WITH A FOCUS ON CLIMATE WHICH YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO TIE INTO CONSERVATION AS WELL

THAT'S ABOUT ALL I CAN THINK OF GOOD LUCK FINDING YOUR PASSION
PHYSICS SCIENCE PUBLIC POLICY IS A VERY INTERESTING FIELD THAT NEEDS MORE ACTIVISTS WORKING WITH LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL LEGISLATORS
I WOULDNT MIND SOMEONE THAT DOESNT WANT TO MAKE THE DAM BIGGER BC ANIMALS COULD GET HURT BUT A THE SAME TIME WANTS TO SHUT DOWN ALL NUCLEAR POWERPLANTS AND ARE AGAINST WIND POWER BECAUSE BIRDS SWISS POLITICS

BUT IF YOU WANT TO SAVE THE ANIMALS SHOW THE NON PHYSICS THAT NOT ANYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH ATOMS IS BAD

I SUGGEST YOU TO GO INTO NUCLEAR OR SIMILIAR THINGS IF SOMEONE HAS ONE THAT COULD LEAD TO POWER SUPPLIES

BECAUSE THE BIGGEST CHANGE YOU COULD DO TO SAVE ANIMALS IS PROBABLY MAKE THE POWER SUPPLY MORE EFFICIENT AND LESS DANGEROUS

AND GOOD LUCK
I'M STUDYING IT BECAUSE IT'S THE LESSER EVIL OPTION TO GO WHEN I DECIDED TO GO INTO THE UNIVERSITY

THERE IS ZERO EVIL ABOUT PHYSICS OR THE OTHER TOPICS PHYSICS BEAT OUT YOUR SUGGESTION ANTHROPOMORPHIZE PHYSICS SINCE PHYSICS PURSUES ONLY THE MOST BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF OUR UNIVERSE

THIS IS A MISTAKE

IF THERE'S ANY EVIL IN SCIENCE THEN THE MATTER IS MORE ABOUT SKETCHY PEOPLE WHO BRING THEIR FLAWED MORALITY TO A BEAUTIFUL KNOWLEDGE


I'M STUDYING AT THE UNIVERSITAS AUTÒNOMA DE BARCELONA AND I ALSO KINDA LOST PASSION FOR PHYSICS OVER TIME I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT WORKING IN RENEWABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS NOT QUITE THE SAME AS IGUALDAD ANIMAL BUT WOULD BE MORE CLOSE TO PHYSICS AND A WAY TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE
YOU COULD TRY TO TEACH

JUST TOSSING OUT AN IDEA HERE HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THE MEDICAL PHYSICS CAREER PATH IT'S NOT ANIMALS BUT IT'S STILL MEANINGFUL
YOU CAN JOIN THE PROTESTS TO REPEAL NEWTONS LAWS
GO TO LAW SCHOOL THOUGH I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT THAT TRACT LOOKS LIKE IN SPAIN YOU COULD ALSO GO TO LAW SCHOOL IN THE US BUT LOTS OF PEOPLE WITH SCIENCE BACKGROUND ARE DESIRED IN LAW BECAUSE IT PROVIDES A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE AND THE ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND SCIENCE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS A HUGE ONE FOR THIS BUT REALLY ANY AREA OF LAW COULD USE SOME SCIENCE AND IF YOU WANTED TO JUST GO AND BE AN ADVOCATE FOR SOMETHING YOU BELIEVE IN THEY ARE USUALLY LOOKING FOR LAWYERS TO PURSUE THOSE AGENDAS
DELETED
I KNOW MORE ABOUT INFORMATION THEORY AND LESS ABOUT PHYSICAL ENTROPY HERE'S MY INTUITION

DEFINE A CANONICAL ENSEMBLE FOR DISCRETE SCALAR FIELD IN A BOX ASSUMING YOUR FIELD IS ERGODIC OTHERWISE YOU MAY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH DEFINING ENTROPY ANYWAY YOU CAN JUST LET THE SIMULATION RUN FOR A LONG TIME AND IT WILL REACH A THERMAL DISTRIBUTION YOU ESTIMATE THE DENSITY FUNCTION OF THIS DISTRIBUTION I CAN GIVE TECHNICAL DETAILS ON HOW TO ACHIEVE THIS

2 GIVEN THE CANONICAL ENSEMBLE THAT IS THE THERMAL DISTRIBUTION YOUR FIELD SHOULD FOLLOW YOU CAN CALCULATE THE PROBABILITY DENSITY OF OBSERVING A CERTAIN STATE THIS PROBABILITY HOWEVER IS NOT RELATED TO ENTROPY IT'S RELATED TO ANOTHER IMPORTANT CONCEPT IN INFORMATION THEORY CALLED SURPRISE PLEASE GIVE THIS ANSWER A READ SO IF YOU THINK OF YOUR THERMAL DISTRIBUTION AS A GAUSSIAN IF YOU START ORGANIZED YOU WILL BE NEAR THE TAIL OF THIS GAUSSIAN IN AN IMPROBABLE STATE THE SURPRISE WILL BE HIGH AS YOU EVOLVE THERMALLY I BELIVE THE SURPRISE SHOULD GET LOWER AND LOWER AS YOUR STATE APPROACHES THE CENTER OF THE GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION AND FLUCTUATE RANDOMLY AROUND A MINIMUM

I THINK THE EVOLUTION OF THE SURPRISE OF THE SYSTEM IS VERY USEFUL AND WELL-DEFINED GIVEN THE ASSUMPTIONS ABOVE CALCULATING THE INSTANTANEOUS ENTROPY SEEMS HARD TO DEFINE AND MAY LEAD YOU INTO INCONSISTENCIES I'LL THINK ABOUT IF IT CAN BE WELL-DEFINED

I BELIEVE THIS HAPPENS IF YOUR BOX IS AT LEAST A LITTLE WEIRD FOR EXAMPLE TRAJECTORIES OF BILLIARDS SHOULD BE CHAOTIC ON THIS BOX HERE'S A PICTURE HETP FOR INTUITION OR THE WAVE EQUATION SHOULD BE MOST ELECTROMAGNETIC MEDIA ARE ACTUALLY LINEAR OTHERWISE SAY IF IT'S A PERFECT SQUARE BOX THE FIELDS MIGHT JUST BE PERIODIC SO A HIGHLY PARTICULAR LOW ENTROPY INITIAL CONDITION WILL RECUR AFTER A PERIOD TENSE IN THAT CASE OBVIOUSLY THE STATISTICAL ASSUMPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH ENTROPY ARE INVALID
HARD TO TELL WHAT ARE THE PROPERTIES OF THIS SCALAR CAN YOU PROVE IT IS CONTINUOUS AND DIFFERENTIABLE IF SO MAYBE YOU COULD TRANSFORM TO A COMPLEX FIELD AND CALCULATE FROM AN INTEGRAL OVER DISTRIBUTIONS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF A POINT

IF YOU WANT TO USE STIRLING APPROX MAYBE YOU COULD TRY DDP
WIKI

I'M JUST SWINGING BLINDLY
CAN YOU CALCULATE THE SPECIFIC HEAT
DON'T YOU NEED TO DETERMINE THE PARTITION FUNCTION
YEAH IT'S STUPID THAT SOME PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND DARK MATTER IS NEARLY PROVEN FACT I DON'T SEE WHY FUNDING IS GOING TOWARDS ASTROPHYSICS RESEARCH OUTSIDE OF DARK MATTER THE BIGGEST OFFENDER IS THIS VERLAINE PAPER S

NO I DON'T ACTUALLY BELIEVE THIS AND SURE THIS SENTIMENT MIGHT BE WHEN TARGETED AGAINST WHO SPOUT NONSENSE BUT THAT DOESN'T REALLY ADD ANYTHING BUT A BITTER ATTITUDE BUT ACTUAL PHYSICISTS WITH THIS SENTIMENT TOWARDS OTHER PHYSICISTS JUST PUTS DOWN OPPOSING THEORIES BECAUSE EVERYTHING POINTS TOWARDS DARK MATTER THIS IS A DANGEROUS SENTIMENT AS RESEARCH SHOULD BE OPEN AND NOT DICTATED BY THE POPULAR OPINION
THIS IS REALLY JUST THE NEW I HAVE AN IDEA ABOUT QUANTUM MECHANICS WHAT IF

HOME BAEZ
SERIOUSLY THIS SHOULD BE REQUIRED READING ANYTIME A POST SHOWS UP ON R SCIENCE OR R SPACE OR WHATEVER ABOUT SOME NEW THEORY THAT EXPLAINS GALAXY ROTATION CURVES I SWEAR THE ARROGANCE OF SOME PEOPLE YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT DARK MATTER BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ALL THE ASTROPHYSICISTS FROM THE LAST CENTURY

ON A MORE POSITIVE NOTE CHECK OUT WIKIPEDIA FOR A LIST OF CURRENT EVIDENCE FOR DARK MATTER THIS INCLUDES NOT ONLY GALAXY ROTATION CURVES BUT ALSO SEVERAL MORE OR LESS UNRELATED THINGS LIKE GRAVITATIONAL LENSING ANISOTROPIES IN THE CB STRUCTURE FORMATION AND THE OCDM COSMOLOGICAL MODEL IN GENERAL

THE BULLET CLUSTER IS THE PIECE THAT USUALLY GETS PEOPLE
IN THE PAST TWO MONTHS THERE'S HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE TO THE DARK MATTER PARADIGM IN THE FORM OF THE RADIAL ACCELERATION RELATION ALSO CALLED ACCELERATION RELATION WE DON'T CURRENTLY UNDERSTAND WHY THIS RELATION EXISTS IT HASN'T BEEN PREDICTED WE DON'T KNOW WHY DARK MATTER SHOULD CARE ABOUT AN INTRINSIC ACCELERATION SCALE AND SIMULATIONS HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DECISIVELY DEMONSTRATE THIS SCALE SHOULD ARISE THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY DARK MATTER HAS BEEN FEATURED A LOT ON THE NEWS RECENTLY AND WHY RANDALL MADE A COMIC ABOUT IT

CONSIDERING THAT THE TYPICAL DARK MATTER ALTERNATIVES MOND OBVIOUSLY BUT ALSO RECENT ONES BY SMOLIN AND VERLAINE FEATURE AN INTRINSIC ACCELERATION SCALE AND WE HAVE OBSERVED THAT INDEED SUCH SCALE EXISTS THESE ALTERNATE THEORIES ARE COMPLETELY JUSTIFIED FROM AN EPISTEMOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW IT'S NOT JUST CRACKPOTTERY UNLESS A DETECTOR OBSERVES A DARK MATTER PARTICLE OR SOMEONE CAN EXPLAIN HOW THE INTRINSIC ACCELERATION SCALE SHOWS UP IN THE DARK MATTER PARADIGM ALTERNATE THEORIES ARE MORE THAN WELCOME

NOW OF COURSE SOMETHING THAT'S ANNOYING IS WHEN A PHILOSOPHY MAJOR THAT KNOWS NOTHING OF PHYSICS COMES AND SAY EPICYCLES VULCAN YOU PHYSICISTS ARE DUMB YOU CAN'T JUST POSTULATE MYSTERIOUS MATTER NOBODY CAN SEE JUST TO SAVE YOUR THEORY YES THOSE PEOPLE CAN GTO
I ALWAYS FEEL STUPID WHEN RANDALL CALLS ME OUT FOR MY AMATEUR THEORIES BUT EVEN STUPIDER WHEN I NEVER EVEN COME TO THEM AT ALL

AND I'M ON MOBILE SO NOT SURE IF YOU LINKED XKCD OR THE COMIC DIRECTLY BUT IF IT'S THE FORMER HERE'S THE PERMALINK FOR FUTURE CIVILIZATIONS WHO COME ACROSS THIS POST
I'M ON MOBILE AND CAN'T SEE ALT TEXT CAN SOMEONE POST IT
I DON'T SEE HOW WRITING A DIFFERENT FIELD THEORY BESIDES AND MAKING NEW PARTICLES ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE A MODIFIED CLASSICAL GR WITH THIS EXTRA FIELD WOULD HAVE EXTRA PARTICLES WHEN QUANTIZED IN ONE INTERPRETATION YOU HAVE EXTRA FIELDS WITH SOME NONVANISHING TEXTURE AND THE OTHER THERE ARE LOTS OF PARTICLES TO MAKE SAID FIELD THAT IS YOU EITHER START WITH A SOLUTION THAT IS TRIVIAL FOR THE EXTRA FIELD SO YOU THINK YOU ARE LOTS OF PARTICLES ABOVE THE VACUUM OR YOU START WITH A DIFFERENT CLASSICAL SOLUTION I DON'T SEE A PROBLEM AT THIS PERTURBATIVE QUANTUM GRAVITY LEVEL OF COURSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT MODIFICATION SO NO CALCULATION TRIED
I THOUGHT THAT PHOTO OF COLLIDING GALAXIES WITH GRAVITATIONAL LENSING ON EITHER SIDE OF THE VISIBLE MATTER WAS SOLID PROOF OF DARK MATTER
I HAVE A BS DEGREE IN PHYSICS AND WHEN AM I GOING TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND STUFF LIKE THIS
YES IT'S FUNNY BUT WE ARE NATURAL SCIENTISTS SO PLEASE TRY TO AVOID AUTOMATICALLY DISMISSING A THEORY BECAUSE IT CONTRADICTS CONSENSUS THIS HAS HAPPENED MANY TIMES IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE AND THE MAJORITY LOOK FOOLISH IN RETROSPECT BE HIGHLY SCEPTICAL OF ALL THEORIES THAT DON'T HAVE A COMPLETE FUNDAMENTAL EXPLANATION

OTHERWISE ASTROPHYSICS RISKS ENDING UP AS BURN THE WITCH POLITICISED AS CLIMATE SCIENCE EVEN IF CONSENSUS IS CORRECT DON'T ATTACK THE ODDBALLS EVEN THE EFFORT OF DISPROVING THEIR THEORIES CAN LEAD TO NEW INSIGHTS
HOW ABOUT DIFFERENT PHYSICAL LAWS FOR DIFFERENT REGIONS OF SPACE
AS SOMEONE RELATIVELY NEW TO THIS SUB AND PHYSICS IN GENERAL UNDERGRAD WHO JUST DECLARED A COUPLE MONTHS AGO COULD YOU GUYS POINT ME IN THE DIRECTION OF SOME THINGS TO READ ON DARK ENERGY AND DARK MATTER THAT WOULDN'T BE TOO OVER MY HEAD

I SAW OP IN THE COMMENTS MENTIONED DARK MATTER IS THE NEW AETHER WITH A TONE OF DISLIKE IS THIS A COMMON BELIEF IN THE PHYSICS COMMUNITY I'VE ALWAYS KIND OF THOUGHT THIS WAY ABOUT DARK ENERGY INSTEAD IT SEEMS TO BE KIND OF A COP-OUT AM I IN THE MINORITY ON THIS OR MAYBE MORE LIKELY AM I IN A MAJORITY BUT THAT MAJORITY IS WRONG
MEANWHILE IN THE COGNITIVE SCIENCES BUILDING


OK I AM A COMPLETE LAYMAN AND DON'T KNOW CRAP TO START WITH BUT COULD BOTH THE WEIRD GRAVITY WE SEE EXTRA PULL AND EXPANSION BE EXPLAINED BY GRAVITATIONAL WAVES SORT OF LIKE WHERE YOU HAVE DROPS OF WATER OSCILLATING AND THEY BOUNCE AROUND ON THE WAVE FRONTS
MOTTO TRANSLATED

NOT REALLY INTERESTED IN DOING THE SCIENCE THING WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT'S UP

I LIKE IT DEFINITELY WOULD WATCH SOMETHING LIKE THAT

STREAMING A REVIEW OF ARXIV PAPERS MIGHT WORK YOUR AUDIENCE WOULD PROBABLY BE LIMITED TO GRAD STUDENTS AND MAYBE SOME UNDERGRADS IN THE SAME FIELD THOUGH SO IT WOULD TAKE SOME WORK REACHING OUT TO GET PEOPLE INVOLVED AND WATCHING
INTERESTING SAVING TO READ TOMORROW
GREAT INITIATIVE
THIS IS A REALLY NEAT IDEA I TUNED INTO THE LIVESTREAM YESTERDAY AND WAS QUITE ENTERTAINED
I PROPOSE A LIVE STREAMING OF ATTEMPTS TO READ A PAPER WRITTEN BY WITTEN MAYBE WITH OR OF OUR HEADS PUT TOGETHER WE WILL FORM A SINGLE FUNCTIONING THEORETICAL PHYSICIST
I HAVE A PHYSICS THEORY THAT IS STUCK IN MY HEAD IF I AM CORRECT THEN THE IMPLICATIONS ARE MASSIVE FOR COSMOLOGY AND THEORETICAL PHYSICS I SHARED IT WITH MY PARENTS YESTERDAY AND AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF STRAIN AND EXPLAINING SIMPLE CONCEPTS LIKE PHOTONS THEY STARTED TO GET IT AND I FOUND THE EXPLAINING PROCESS HELPFUL

I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT MY THEORY AND THEN CREATING A VIDEO RATHER THAN TRYING TO GET PUBLISHED HOW WOULD IT BE IF THE NEXT BIG THEORY WAS REVEALED IN A

DO YOU THINK PEOPLE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN LISTENING TO A RANDOM PHYSICS THEORY I WILL GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION BELOW

ONE WAY TO DESIGN A TWITCH CHANNEL MIGHT BE TO HAVE A PANEL OF PHYSICISTS AND LET PEOPLE CALL IN WITH THEIR THEORIES AND HAVE THE PANEL ASSESS THE POTENTIAL OF EACH THEORY

I USED TO WATCH THEODDONE THEN REYNA THEN STRIFECROW WHAT GAMES DO YOU WATCH

THEORY

ACCORDING TO MY INTERNET RESEARCH THE UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING BUT NOT LIKE THE EXPLOSION OF A HAND GRENADE WHERE ALL THE THINGS COME OUT FROM THE CENTRAL POINT RATHER EMPTY SPACE IS CONTINUOUSLY BEING CREATED OR COMING INTO BEING BETWEEN THE THINGS OUR GALAXY APPEARS TO BE AT THE CENTER OF AN EXPLOSION OUTWARD DUE TO THE FACT THAT ALL THINGS ON A COSMOLOGICAL SCALE ARE RED SHIFTED BUT THAT IS AN ILLUSION AND THE REALITY IS THAT EVERYTHING IS SITTING STILL AND SPACE IS APPEARING BETWEEN THE THINGS

OUR GALAXY IS ESSENTIALLY AT REST WITH RESPECT TO THE CBR WE ASSUME OTHER GALAXIES ARE AT REST WITH RESPECT TO THE CBR AND THAT THE LIGHT WE SEE FROM DISTANT GALAXIES AND QUASARS HAS BEEN EXPANDED BY THE UNIVERSE AND NOT A DOPPLER SHIFT

IF I UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION CORRECTLY THERE ARE SOME INTERESTING IMPLICATIONS FOR COSMOLOGY WHICH I WOULD LOVE TO EXPLAIN TO A GROUP AND EXPLORE AS A GROUP

HOW POSSIBLE WOULD THIS BE


ANOTHER IDEA MIGHT BE TO JUST PICK A TOPIC AND DISCUSS IT AS A GROUP SO RANDOM PEOPLE CAN INVITE THEIR FRIENDS AND PARENTS TO GET THEIR MINDS BLOWN FOR EXAMPLE YOU COULD MAKE FRIDAY WAVE MOTION DAY AND TALK ABOUT LIGHT INTERFERENCE HOW A PRISM BREAKS A WHITE BEAM INTO A RAINBOW AND HOW RAINBOWS WORK AND HOW RESONANT FREQUENCY TOOK OUT THE TACOMA NARROWS BRIDGE

NEXT WEEK YOU COULD TALK ABOUT VALENCE ELECTRONS AND HOW THEY INFLUENCE THE PERIODIC TABLE HOW SPECTRAL LINES HELP ASTRONOMERS WITH FIGURING OUT THE ELEMENTS IN A STAR OR ATMOSPHERE AND HOW THAT IMPACTS OUR KNOWLEDGE OF HOW CELESTIAL OBJECTS ARE MOVING

I THINK THAT PEOPLE WHO MIGHT FALL ASLEEP DURING A LECTURE MIGHT GRAVITATE TO A DISCUSSION WHERE INSTEAD OF LEARNING ABOUT THE IDEAL GAS LAW THROUGH EQUATIONS YOU DESCRIBE IT THROUGH THE MECHANICS OF A REFRIGERATOR

POSSIBLE PHYSICS STREAMS

TOPICAL DISCUSSIONS WITH THE WHOLE COMMUNITY LEAD BY ONE TO FIVE LEADERS

2 THEORY STREAMS WHICH EMULATE DRAGON'S DEN WHERE PEOPLE SHARE THEIR THEORIES AND RECEIVE FEEDBACK ABOUT THE VIABILITY OF THE THEORY

TOPICAL HOMEWORK HELP STREAMS WHERE A STUDENT MIGHT DONATE DEPENDING ON THE DEMAND AND GET STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM BENEFITING THE WHOLE STUDENT COMMUNITY

TOPICAL LECTURES BY EXPERTS WHO TAKE QUESTIONS AND WHO HAVE TIME TO RAMBLE ON ABOUT THE TOPIC WITH LESS CONSTRAINT THAN THEY MIGHT EXPERIENCE ADDRESSING STUDENTS OR ON A TED TALK

BOTTOM LINE

WHO IS RUNNING THE STREAM

HOW MANY PEOPLE

WHAT LEVEL OF EXPERTISE

2 WHO IS WATCHING THE STREAM

EXPERTS

STUDENTS

INTERESTED

HIGH MATH OR LOW MATH

THERE ARE LOTS OF INTERESTING COMBINATIONS THAT COULD SERVE A MARKET IF WE COULD GET A MARKET DEVELOPED FRANKLY THIS COULD BE THE FUTURE OF TUTORING LET'S GET A BANK LOAN AND START UP A STREAMING WEBSITE TARGETING STUDENTS AT FIRST BUT BRANCHING OUT INTO ALL FORMS OF KNOWLEDGE CONSUMPTION AS EXPOSURE GROWS

HOW MUCH COULD ASPIRING WRITERS LEARN FROM WATCHING EDITORS EDIT

HOW FAST WOULD A STREAM ABOUT PERSONAL FINANCING GROW

THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS I LOVE IT
ABOUT CLASSICAL PHENOMENA THAT'S TRUE ABOUT QUANTUM MECHANICS IT IS NOT WHICH IS PRESUMABLY WHY THE AUTHOR EXPLICITLY SAYS THAT INTERPRETATIONS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS ARE AN EXCEPTION

THE WAY HE PHRASES IT SEEMS TO IMPLY THAT ONLY CONTROVERSIAL INTERPRETATIONS OF QM ARE THE EXCEPTION BUT I THINK THAT HE PROBABLY MEANT THAT THE INTERPRETATION OF RANDOMNESS IN QUANTUM MECHANICS IS GENERALLY CONTROVERSIAL AS OF RIGHT NOW NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THE ORIGIN OF RANDOMNESS IN QUANTUM MECHANICS IS AND IT'S THE SUBJECT OF MUCH DEBATE

FUN FACT ONE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CLASSICAL PROBABILITY AND QM IS THAT BAYES RULE ISN'T GENERALLY CORRECT FOR OBSERVABLES IN QM QUANTUM RANDOMNESS IS GENERALLY A DIFFERENT KIND OF THING FROM CLASSICAL RANDOMNESS
IS THIS THE GENERAL CONSENSUS ON THIS MATTER

NO THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF THE COPENHAGEN THE MAIN INTERPRETATION
EXCEPT THE WORD CONTROVERSIAL IT'S MORE OR LESS ACCURATE INTERPRETATIONS OF QM WHERE OUTCOMES ARE RANDOM GOING BY THE NAME OF COPENHAGEN INTERPRETATION AND ITS VARIOUS OFFSPRINGS ARE THE MOST POPULAR ONES AMONG PHYSICISTS AND AMONG EXPERTS ON QUANTUM FOUNDATIONS SO CALLING THEM CONTROVERSIAL MIGHT NOT BE TOO ACCURATE


ACTUALLY BY EXTENSION SINCE THE ENTIRE WORLD IS QUANTUM IN SOME SENSE THE ENTIRE WORLD IS ACTUALLY RANDOM GIVEN THAT YOU BELIEVE IN THAT SORT OF INTERPRETATION BUT THAT'S BEING VERY PEDANTIC
NO IT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT THE GENERAL CONSENSUS THERE IS HUGE VARIANCE IN WHETHER THE COPENHAGEN INTERPRETATION IS CORRECT OR THIS STANCE IS CORRECT AND IN ANY EVENT UNTIL THERE IS A THEORY OR TEST DEVISED THAT CAN DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE TWO STANCES A FIRM COMMITMENT TO EITHER MODEL IS UNSCIENTIFIC IT IS MORE RESPONSIBLE TO TAKE A POSITIVIST SCIENTIFIC POSITIVISM AS OPPOSED TO SCIENTIFIC REALISM ATTITUDE AND UNDERSTAND THAT THESE ARE ALL MODELS FOR HUMAN UNDERSTANDING OF QUANTUM PHENOMENA SUBJECT TO FUTURE REFINEMENT AND IMPROVEMENT

OR TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY AS SOMEONE WITH DEGREES IN PHYSICS AND PHILOSOPHY YOU WILL ONLY EVER FIND PHYSICISTS WHO ARE IGNORANT OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE TAKING A FIRM STANCE ON WHICH MODEL IS RIGHT BECAUSE IT IS AN UNSCIENTIFIC POSITION TO TAKE BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE TO UNDERSTAND WHY BASICALLY BECAUSE THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORTS ONE MODEL OVER THE OTHER AND INTUITION IS NOT A SUFFICIENT BASIS FOR PREFERRING ONE TO THE OTHER
I REJECT THE STATEMENT IT IS FOUNDATIONAL TO MODERN PHYSICS THAT VARIABLES ARE IMPLICIT TO THE WAVE NATURE OF MATTER ON A SMALL SCALE ADDITIONALLY CHEMICAL REACTIVITY BONDING SPECTROSCOPY ALL THESE ARE COMPATIBLE WITH THE COPENHAGEN INTERPRETATION THE STAMENS IMPLIES LIMITATIONS IN MEASURING RESULT IN A WAVE PICTURE RANDOM IN FACT THE UNCERTAINTY WAVE VIEW IS AN INHERENT PROPERTY OF MATTER AND ENERGY THE VERACITY OF THE COPENHAGEN VIEW IS THE FACT THAT ALL OD MODERN CHEMISTRY AND CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS HAS BEEN BUILT ON THIS PERSPECTIVE THAT SAID THERE ARE STILL UNRESOLVED ISSUES THAT INTERSECT PHILOSOPHY BUT I SAY SHUT UP AND CALCULATE
THE CONSENSUS IS THAT QUANTUM MECHANICS HAS RANDOMNESS AND THERE'S NOTHING CONTROVERSIAL ABOUT THIS

INTERPRETATIONS THAT CLAIM

PRESUMABLY IF WE HAD MORE INFORMATION WE COULD EXACTLY PREDICT EVERYTHING

ARE THE CONTROVERSIAL ONES

WE JUST USE RANDOMNESS TO DESCRIBE OUR UNCERTAINTY IN THE FACE OF INCOMPLETE KNOWLEDGE

NUMBER IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY RANDOM NOT BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW BETTER AND THAT'S OUR PROBABILISTIC ESTIMATE OF SOMETHING WE DON'T KNOW LIKE A SURVEY POLL

BY TRANSITIVITY YOU MAY WELL CONSIDER MACROSCOPIC BEHAVIOUR TO ALSO BE RANDOM SO I WOULD ALSO DOUBT THAT NOTHING IN THE REAL WORLD IS ACTUALLY RANDOM BUT ONLY IF YOU LOOK CLOSE ENOUGH NOT SUPERFICIALLY

THE OTHERS SEEM TO HAVE FOCUSSED TOO MUCH ON THE PHYSICAL STATEMENT AND TOO LITTLE ON THE IMPLICATION

THAT WELL-KNOWN BOOK YOU ARE QUOTING IS WRONG QUANTUM RANDOMNESS EFFECTS EXPERIENTIAL REALITY QUICKLY CERTAINLY WITHIN MONTHS AND PROBABLY WITHIN MINUTES THE CLASSICAL EXAMPLE OF THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT CAN BE EXTENDED EVEN FURTHER SO THAT A QUANTUM PERTURBATION NOW AFFECTS THE WEATHER ACROSS THE PLANET IN TWO TO SIX MONTHS AND BEFORE YOU UNDERESTIMATE THE WEATHER CONSIDER THAT THAT CAN SAY INFLUENCE WHEN PEOPLE LEAVE THEIR HOMES WHICH CHANGES THE ORDER OF TRAFFIC WHICH CHANGES WHEN CAR ACCIDENTS HAPPEN AND TO WHOM WHICH CHANGES PEOPLE'S ENTIRE LIVES FOREVER

THEREFORE NO MATTER WHAT KNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE OF REALITY YOU CAN'T PREDICT WHO LIVES AND WHO DIES FIVE MONTHS FROM NOW A SINGLE MUTATION IN THE DNA OF A FRUIT FLY IN ZIMBABWE ONE WEEK FROM NOW WOULD CHANGE THE ANSWER

THE BOOK IS CORRECT THAT RANDOMNESS AS DEFINED IN BAYESIAN THEORY INCLUDES UNCERTAINTY OF THE OBSERVER
THE DOUBLE RAINBOW IS CAUSED BY A DOUBLE REFLECTION WITH RAIN DROPS WHICH EXPLAINS THE ROYGBIV REVERSAL

THE VERTICAL RAINBOW IS A REFLECTED RAINBOW NOTE THE COLOR ORDERING MOST LIKELY DUE TO MULTIPATH PROPAGATION OF SUNLIGHT OFF OF A NEARBY REFLECTIVE SURFACE EAST G A CLOUD A CALM BODY OF WATER WET ROAD WET GRASS
HERE IS SOME MORE INFORMATION ON REFLECTION RAINBOWS ALSO LOOK AROUND THE SITE FOR SOME OTHER COOL ATMOSPHERIC OPTICAL PHENOMENA

RAINBOWS
LIKE U KIBOSH SAID THE THIRD RAINBOW IS DUE TO A REFLECTED LIGHT SOURCE
THAT IS WHERE YOU FIND THE POT OF GOLD
THE VIDEO WAS MUCH SHORTER THAN I HOPED
COUPLE THINGS I SPOTTED THAT ARE INCORRECT IN THIS VIDEO FIRST OF ALL ITER IS NO LONGER AN ACRONYM BUT IS A LATIN WORD MEANING THE WAY AS IN THE WAY TO CLEAN ENERGY SECONDLY THE NOTION THAT WE WOULD MINE THE MOON FOR HELIUM IS PRETTY RIDICULOUS IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER TO BUILD A BREEDER REACTOR THAT MAKES TRITIUM ON EARTH

ALSO THE TEMPERATURE REQUIRED FOR FUSION IN A TOKAMAK IS MUCH HIGHER THAN THE TEMPERATURES IN THE CORE FOR THE SUN FOR ONE THE PLASMA AT THE CENTER OF THE SUN IS MUCH MORE DENSE SO THE RATE OF REACTION IS HIGHER AND THE SHEER NUMBER OF NUCLEI ALLOWS FOR QUANTUM TUNNELING THAT IS LESS LIKELY TO OCCUR WITH FEWER IONS

THIS IS THE JUST A COUPLE MISTAKES THIS VIDEO MADE WHICH IS A SHAME SINCE KURZGESAGT USUALLY MAKES GOOD CONTENTION UNFORTUNATELY THE PROSPECTS FOR FUSION AREN'T GREAT THOSE IN THE BUSINESS ANTICIPATE THAT OPTIMISTICALLY ECONOMICALLY COMPETITIVE FUSION POWER WOULD BE ON THE MARKET BY RIGHT NOW ITER SEEMS LIKE A LAST DITCH EFFORT FOR FUSION IT'S SLATED TO GO ONLINE IN THE NEXT DECADE AND IF IT DOESN'T REACH FUEL GAIN IT COULD BE THE END OF THE QUEST FOR FUSION
THERE IS A 3RD METHOD TO COMPRESS NUCLEI FOR FUSION
FOCUS FUSION
IT USES MAGNETIC FIELDS THAT COMPRESSES NUCLEI TOGETHER TOWARDS A SINGLE FOCUS POINT
ACCORDING TO THE SPEAKER IT IS CHEAPER TO DEVELOP BUT THE CURRENT VERSION NEEDS RELATIVELY HEAVY ATOMS LIKE BERYLLIUM ITS EFFECTS HAVE BEEN TESTED WITH CHEAP EQUIPMENT ALREADY I DO NOT KNOW THE CURRENT STATUS OF THIS METHOD

AREN'T ALL OF THE PROMISES OF FUSION ALREADY AVAILABLE THROUGH THORIUM WE KNOW IT WORKS AND WILL BE ECONOMICAL WHY NOT INVEST IN THAT AT LEAST FOR A FEW THOUSAND YEARS
I THINK IT KIND OF UNDERMINES SOME OF THE EFFECTS OF FUSION IN IDEAL FUSION ONE GLASS OF WATER WOULD MOST CERTAINLY NOT CREATE THE SAME AMOUNT OF ENERGY AS ONE BARREL OF OIL IT WOULD CREATE MUCH LARGER AMOUNTS OF ENERGY AND IF NOT EXPLAINED THAT THIS CUP OF SEA WATER WOULD ALREADY CONTAIN THE NECESSARY COMPONENTS TO PRODUCE THIS AMOUNT OF ENERGY WE MIGHT VIEW IT AS THE CUP OF SEE WATER AND THEN SOME

BEYOND THAT THE RESEARCH IN FUSION HAS MANY OTHER VERY VITAL PAY OFFS BE IT MILITARISTIC OR COMMERCIAL OR FUEL FOR OTHER RESEARCH
I CAME TO THIS SUB TO ASK ABOUT THIS SOURCE IS THIS A GOOD SOURCE FOR EXPLAINING SOME OF THE BASICS OF PHYSICS

I'M NOT TRYING TO PASS A CLASS OR ANYTHING I'M JUST CURIOUS AND LOOKING FOR AN ENTERTAINING AND ACCURATE CHANNEL ABOUT THE HARD SCIENCES
ANYONE WHO THINKS IT CAN'T WORK IS CLEARLY RIDICULOUS WE HAVE LITERALLY TRILLIONS OF EXAMPLES
ITER IS A MASSIVE WASTE OF TIME AND RESOURCES IT'S ALREADY OBSOLETE

IT'S ALREADY OLD TECH AT LEAST A GENERATION BEHIND ON SUPERCONDUCTOR TYPES PERFORMANCE AND FIELD STRENGTH WE COULD BUILD A REACTOR TODAY WITH IT'S ONLY LIMIT BEING STRUCTURAL STRENGTH WE CAN BUILD NEW RECCO COILS STRONG ENOUGH TO CONTAIN PLASMA AT PRESSURES THAT BECOME DIFFICULT TO CONTAIN PHYSICALLY MIT HAS THE DESIGN READY BUT WE'RE DUMPING THE COST AND THE TIME INTO A DESIGN FROM LAST CENTURY ITER THAT IS NOTHING MORE THAN AN EXPERIMENT
NICE ANIMATIONS BUT IT'S PRETTY LOW EFFORT AND ONLY REPEATS THE USUAL CLICHES ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY ISN'T ACCURATE AND DOESN'T OFFER ANY REAL INSIGHT I DON'T KNOW WHAT PLACE THIS HAS ON THIS SUBREDDIT OR WHY IT GETS OVER UPVOTES

FOR ACTUAL INSIGHT READ
NO MENTION OF QUANTUM TUNNELING THAT'S A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING

I LOVE KURZGESAGT VIDEOS
THE VIDEO MENTIONS THAT SO FAR IT TAKES MORE ENERGY TO CREATE A FUSION REACTION THAN WHAT IT GIVES WHERE DOES THE DIFFERENCE GO

LOVE THAT BZ REFERENCE BY THE WAY
READING QED BY FEYNMAN AND LOVING IT IVE ONLY TAKEN HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE COURSES BUT THIS BOOK ITS THE PERFECT AMOUNT OF TECHNICAL DOES ANYONE KNOW ANYTHING SIMILAR BESIDES OTHER FEYNMAN STUFF OF COURSE
SINCERELY RECOMMEND AN INTRODUCTION TO RELATIVISTIC QUANTUM FIELD THEORY BY SILVAN SOUTH SCHREIBER IT'S AN OLDER BOOK BUT WRITTEN EXTREMELY WELL
I'M LOOKING TO EXPAND AND SOLIDIFY MY UNDERSTANDING OF LINEAR ALGEBRA CAN ANYONE RECOMMEND A GOOD BOOK AT ABOUT A GRADUATE LEVEL PREFERABLY WITH A FOCUS ON APPLICATIONS IN PHYSICS
I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE SEEN THIS POSTED HERE BEFORE BUT THIS YOUTUBE CHANNEL HAS TONS OF MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS RELATED VISUALIZATIONS I ESPECIALLY LIKE THE ONE ON FOURIER SERIES
I LAST STUDIED PHYSICS IN HIGH SCHOOL RECENTLY STARTED TAKING THE KHAN ACADEMY COURSES ON VECTORS AND SCALARS RIGHT NOW AND IT'S MAKING ME REALISE THE ONLY WAY I PASSED HIGH SCHOOL PHYSICS WAS BY MUGGING UP EQUATIONS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THEM LOGICALLY NOW AS AN ADULT IS PROVING DIFFICULT BUT SUPER INTERESTING AND WAY MORE EXCITING
HI EVERYONE I'M A 6TH FORM STUDENT WHO STUDIES PHYSICS AND INTERESTED IN QUANTUM MECHANICS ALL I'M LOOKING FOR IS A GOOD SOLID RESOURCE TO HELP MY UNDERSTANDING TO BOTH THE MATHEMATICAL SIDE TO THE TOPIC BUT ALSO THE THEORY ASPECT I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW ANY SUGGESTIONS OF BOOKS ONLINE RESOURCES I STUDY THE MIT QUANTUM PHYSICS COURSE AND MIT MATHS OR GENERAL TIPS FOR GOING THROUGH QM
WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS THE LAWS WEREN'T EXPLAINED IT WAS FUN TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHICH ANIMATED TOON SITUATION THEY WERE THINKING OF THIS ONE MADE ME LAUGH THE HARDEST

GRAVITY IS TRANSMITTED BY SLOW-MOVING WAVES OF LARGE WAVELENGTHS

YUP AS IS CLEAR FROM THIS EXPERIMENT
WATCH V T
I WORK AS A RESEARCHER POSTHOC RELIGION PLAYS NO ROLE WHATSOEVER IN MY WORK

I DO DISCUSS MATTERS SUCH AS RELIGION POLITICS ETC WITH COLLEAGUES THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM ARE UNBELIEVERS OF COURSE A FEW OF THEM AREN'T IT'S NO REAL ISSUE AND I DON'T RECALL NOR HAVE HEARD OF THERE BEING ANY CONFLICTS BECAUSE OF THIS IN ANY PHYSICS RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT PERSONALLY I FIND THE CLAIMS OF RELIGIONS THAT I AM AWARE OF POORLY JUSTIFIED AND LACKING EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE
I KNOW SOME PHYSICISTS WHO ARE RELIGIOUS BUT ALL IN ALL I DON'T THINK ANYONE TAKES IT SERIOUSLY I PERSONALLY SEE IT AS A VIRUS THAT IS SOMETIMES HARMLESS BUT CAN EASILY MUTATE INTO THE HARMFUL CRAP WE SEE TODAY WHEN IT DOES COME UP IT'S USUALLY EXASPERATED DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW THAT FANTASY SHIT HAS INVADED OUR POLITICS AND THREATENS US

IDEALLY RELIGION TRIES TO ANSWER THE WHY OF THINGS WHILE PHYSICS ANSWERS THE HOW OF THINGS BUT YOU KNOW IN REALITY RELIGIONS JUST CAN'T LEAVE IT ALONE SO WE SHOULD REALLY TREAT IT AS THE VIRUS IT IS AND RID OURSELVES OF IT AND QUARANTINE THOSE WHO ARE INFECTED UNTIL WE CURE THEM
THE ISSUE I PERSONALLY HAVE IS THAT RELIGION IS A SYSTEM BUILT ON FAITH WHEREAS SCIENCE IS BUILT ON EVIDENCE ALONE I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT NO GOOD SCIENTIST SHOULD BE RELIGIOUS SINCE THAT SEEMS LIKE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST TO ME TO EACH THEIR OWN I SUPPOSE
WELL LOOKING AT ALL THE POSTDOCS IN MY DEPARTEMENT I'D SAY THEY ARE TOO BUSY WITH WORK AND MATH TO THINK ABOUT GOD
THE PROBABILITY THAT YOU WOULD SUBJECTIVELY EXPERIENCE SURVIVING THE EXPERIMENT WOULD BE GIVEN OWI AND A LOT SMALLER GIVEN COPENHAGEN OR SOMETHING SIMILAR FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF EVERYBODY ELSE OR FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF SOMEBODY WITH A OF THE WHOLE WAVEFUNCTION THEY WOULD OF COURSE BE IDENTICAL BUT THE SUBJECTIVE PROBABILITIES ARE DIFFERENT
I WOULD CHARACTERIZE IT AS A BIZARRE BUT GROUNDED IN SCIENTIFIC REASONING NOT PURELY A JOKE EXPERIMENT MOTIVATED BY AN INTEREST TO KNOW IF THE MANY WORLDS INTERPRETATION OF QUANTUM MECHANICS IS CORRECT MIT'S MAX TELEMARK HAS BEEN ONE OF THE ONES TO TALK ABOUT THIS IDEA I REMEMBER READING SOMEWHERE THAT TELEMARK ONCE ARTICULATED THE IDEA TO THE LEGENDARY JOHN WHEELER IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN BOOK OUR MATHEMATICAL UNIVERSE I'M NOT SURE I VAGUELY REMEMBER BUT I'M NOT POSITIVE ABOUT THIS THAT WHEELER DIDN'T COMMENT ON IT APPARENTLY TELEMARK HAS EVEN PRESUMABLY JOKINGLY SUGGESTED THAT HE MIGHT SOMEDAY TRY THE EXPERIMENT BUT ONLY ONCE HE'S OLD AND CRAZY HERE IS AN ARTICLE ABOUT IT THAT DISCUSSES ABOUT SETTING UP THE EXPERIMENT THE PROBABILITIES INVOLVED AND THE FACT THAT THE INTERPRETATION EVEN IF CORRECT WOULD ONLY BE PROVEN TO SOME SURVIVING VERSION OF THE EXPERIMENTER

SURELY THIS WOULD BE A STRONG CONTENDER FOR FIRST PRIZE IN A SCIENTIFIC IDEAS WITHOUT A PRACTICAL APPLICATION CONTEST
IT ISN'T A JOKE IF YOU ARE A PHYSICALIST I EAST YOU THINK CONSCIOUSNESS ARISES JUST FROM THE LAWS OF PHYSICS WHO THINKS THE MANY WORLDS INTERPRETATION OF QUANTUM MECHANICS IS TRUE THEN YOU ARE PRETTY MUCH COMMITTED TO BELIEVING IN QUANTUM IMMORTALITY THAT IS IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE THERE IS SOME MAGIC SOUL THAT IS ATTACHED TO ONLY ONE OF THE MANY COPIES OF YOU IN THE MULTIVERSE THEN IF ONE OF THE COPIES DIES THERE IS STILL A COPY OF YOU THAT EXISTS AND THERE IS NO MEANINGFUL SENSE IN WHICH YOU CAN PREFERENCE ONE OF THE COPIES OVER ANY OTHER THAT IS YOU CAN'T WORRY ABOUT WHICH ONE IS THE REAL YOU BECAUSE THEY ALL ARE THE REAL YOU SO FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE YOU WILL NEVER DIE SINCE NONE OF THE DEAD COPIES CAN BE AWARE OF BEING DEAD THERE ARE ONLY THE ALIVE COPIES THAT ARE AWARE OF BEING ALIVE THIS IS JUST THE ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF OTHERS YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY ETC YOU WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY DIE BUT FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE YOU WILL BE ALIVE IN ONE OF THE UNIVERSES IN WHICH YOU SURVIVED
IT'S BASED ON QUANTUM SUPERPOSITION A SUPERPOSITION OF YOUR PARTICLES WILL ALWAYS EXIST IN SOME UNIVERSE THAT BEING SAID I AM HIGHLY SKEPTICAL OF OWI
YOU CAN MEASURE CONSTANT WITH LEDS
ONE OF MY FAVORITES IS USING AN EMPTY SODA CAN TO DEMONSTRATE ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE IT'S SIMPLE TO SET UP AND SURPRISINGLY WEIRD IF YOU KNOW GOING ON
IF YOU HAVE UNUSED CDS STILL LYING AROUND YOUR HOUSE YOU CAN BUILD A VISIBLE LIGHT SPECTROMETER
ZHUXJ ASTRO HEML
IT'S REALLY EASY AND YOU CAN USE IT TO LEARN QUITE A BIT ABOUT ATOMS AND OUR LIGHT SOURCES IT'S REALLY INTERESTING TO LOOK AT SOME LIGHTS YOU HAVE AT HOME AND SEE HOW DIFFERENT THEIR SPECTRUM LOOKS EVEN THOUGH THEY ALL SEEM WHITE TO US

IF YOU WANT TO GO MORE INADEPT YOU CAN BUILD A REFLECTION SPECTROMETER THIS WAY SHINE A FLASHLIGHT USING NORMAL LIGHTBULBS ON AN OBJECT AND LOOK AT THE REFLECTED LIGHT WITH THE SPECTROMETER YOU'LL SEE HOW THE RED OBJECTS REDUCE THE INTENSITY OF ALL OTHER LIGHT BUT RED ETC

YOU CAN ALSO TAKE A PHOTO THROUGH THIS SPECTROSCOPE WITH YOUR SMARTPHONE AND THEN HAVE A BIT OF FUN WITH ANALYSING THE DATA TAKE THE IMAGE INTO PHOTOSHOP GIMP CUT OUT THE RELEVANT PART AND THEN LOOK AT THE INTENSITIES OF RED GREEN AND BLUE

THIS STUFF GETS VERY CLOSE TO FEELING LIKE ACTUAL RESEARCH OF COURSE ON STUFF THAT WAS ALREADY FIGURED OUT A LONG TIME AGO BUT WHO CARES IF YOU'RE DOING SOME AWESOME STUFF AT HOME

MEASURING THE SPEED OF LIGHT WITH CHOCOLATE AND A MICROWAVE
YOU CAN USE A LASER POINTER AND A COUPLE HAIRS TO SET UP THE CLASSICAL EXPERIMENT

IF YOU HAVE LINEAR POLARIZER IN SOME SUNGLASSES OR 3D GLASSES YOU CAN SEE HOW THEY REMOVE REFLECTIONS FROM WINDOWS AT A PARTICULAR ANGLE CALLED ANGLE AND USE IT TO CALCULATE THE REFRACTIVE INDEX OF THE GLASS SAME FOR WATER OR ANY OTHER REFLECTIVE SURFACE YOU CAN ALSO SORT OF SEE THE POLARIZATION CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SKY WHEN YOU PUT ON THE SUNGLASSES THE ENTIRE SKYLINE ISN'T DARKENED EVENLY BECAUSE OF A SIMILAR PHENOMENON IN ATMOSPHERIC SCATTERING

AN ALTERNATE WAY TO FIND THE INDEX OF REFRACTION OF WATER IS TO SHINE A LASER POINTER INTO IT USE A TRANSPARENT CONTAINER SO THAT YOU CAN SHINE THE LIGHT IN FROM THE SIDE AND HAVE IT BOUNCE OFF THE UPPER SURFACE FROM THE INSIDE THIS REFLECTION ONLY HAPPENS WHEN THE ANGLE IS SHALLOW ENOUGH AND YOU CAN INFER THE REFRACTIVE INDEX FROM THE CRITICAL ANGLE

WITH AN ENGINEERING BENT THERE ARE VARIOUS TUTORIALS ONLINE THAT TEACH YOU TO MAKE REFLECTORS TO BOOST THE GAIN OF A WIFI OR BLUETOOTH ANTENNA WITH SOME BEACON SOFTWARE YOU CAN SEE HOW THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE REFLECTOR VARIES WITH ITS DISTANCE TO THE ANTENNA AND HOPEFULLY I HAVEN'T TRIED IT IN A REALISTIC ENVIRONMENT MYSELF SEE HOW THE CONDITION STRONGLY AFFECTS THE SIGNAL

YOU CAN ACTUALLY MAKE YOUR OWN CLOUD CHAMBER AND SEE DECAYING PARTICLES A BIT FINICKY TO BUILD BUT DOABLE

IT'S NOT HARD TO MAKE YOUR OWN MOTOR WITH A BATTERY A MAGNET AND SOME WIRE ALTERNATIVELY MAKE A GENERATOR ATTACHED TO A WATERWHEEL AND USE YOUR SINK TO POWER AN LED

USE A PRISM TO SPLIT SUNLIGHT AND PUT A THERMOMETER IN THE PATH OF THE SPECTRUM NOTE THAT THE TEMPERATURE GOES UP NOW PLACE IT IN A SPOT BEYOND THE RED STRIP IT STILL GOES UP CONGRATS YOU DISCOVERED INFRARED LIGHT

BUILD A COLLECTION OF PENDULUMS ON A COMMON ROTATION AXIS LINKED BY SPRINGS AT THEIR BASE GET TO KNOW THE EQUATION AND THE BEHAVIOUR OF SOLITONS
FILL A GLASS WITH A SMOOTH TOP FULL OF WATER TAKE A STURDY PIECE OF PAPER PRESS IT AGAINST THE TOP WITH ONE HAND AND FLIP THE GLASS OVER WITH TWO HANDS MAKE SURE YOU ARE PRESSING THE PAPER EVENLY WHILE THE GLASS IS UPSIDE DOWN THEN REMOVE THE BOTTOM HAND THE PAPER WILL HOLD THE WATER IN BECAUSE THE AIR CAN'T GET THROUGH AND REPLACE IT PRACTICE OVER A SINK OR BATHTUB UNTIL YOU CAN DO IT
NOT REALLY AN EXPERIMENT BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE FIND INTERESTING FIND TWO IDENTICAL THINGS DROP ONE FROM A HEIGHT AND THROW THE OTHER ONE FROM THE SAME HEIGHT BUT HORIZONTAL TO THE GROUND THEY WILL LAND AT THE SAME TIME TELL THEM IT'S BECAUSE THE HORIZONTAL COMPONENT OF YOUR SPEED NEVER CHANGES MINUS AIR DRAG AND YOUR VERTICAL COMPONENT IS GRAVITY THE DISTANCE THEY DROP IS THE SAME SO THEY ARE IN THE AIR FOR THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME
I'M ABOUT TO ENTER MY FINAL YEAR MAJORING IN PHYSICS AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND MY GOAL IS TO ENTER ASTROPHYSICAL RESEARCH I HAVE ONE EXTRA UNIT SPOT IN MY FINAL SEMESTER AND I CAN'T DECIDE BETWEEN DOING ANOTHER STATISTICS COURSE I DID ONE INTRODUCTORY COURSE IN FIRST YEAR OR ANOTHER PROGRAMMING COURSE WOULD BE INTRODUCTORY LEVEL C ALREADY HAD ONE COURSE AND RESEARCH EXPERIENCE WITH JAVA

THE FACULTY I HAVE SPOKEN TO HAVE RECOMMENDED TAKING THE STATS COURSE OVER THE PROGRAMMING ONE BUT I'M WORRIED THAT MY COMPUTING BACKGROUND IS TOO WEAK GIVEN THAT I HAVEN'T HAD ANY EXPERIMENTAL EXPERIENCE AND I'M NOT TOO COMFORTABLE WITH EXPERIMENTAL ANYWAY NOT HAVING A SOLID COMPUTER SCIENCE BACKGROUND MIGHT BE QUITE A DETRIMENT IN THE FUTURE

IS TAKING A STATS COURSE REALLY MORE BENEFICIAL THAN A C COURSE WITHOUT A SOLID CS BACKGROUND I ONLY HAVE DATA ANALYSIS EXPERIENCE AND I DON'T WANT TO BE FORCED INTO EXPERIMENTAL ASTROPHYSICS
I WON'T BE STUDYING PHYSICS IN SCHOOL AS I'M DOING COMPUTER SCIENCE BUT I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN DOING SOME READING ON MY OWN SO BECAUSE I WON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO DEDICATE TO MULTIPLE THINGS WHAT IS THE BEST BRANCH OF PHYSICS THAT WILL ALLOW ME TO STUDY PARTICLES EMR AND QUANTUM PRINCIPLES I'M ALSO QUITE INTERESTED IN NUCLEAR PHYSICS BUT I'D LOVE TO FOCUS MORE ON PRINCIPLES OF LIGHT AND RADIATION IN GENERAL

MAYBE I SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR A MORE GENERAL RESOURCE CAN ANYONE RECOMMEND A TEXTBOOK
HOW WORRIED IS THE PHYSICS RESEARCH COMMUNITY ABOUT THE NEXT FOUR YEARS IN THE US SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF DISCRETIONARY GOVERNMENT FUNDING COULD BE ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK I'M APPLYING NOW FOR MATERIALS SCIENCE PHD PROGRAMS AND I GET THE SENSE THAT THERE IS NOW MORE RISK THAN EVER IN PURSUING A RESEARCH CAREER
SINCE I HAVE TO CHOOSE A SPECIALISATION SOON WHICH FIELDS HAVE A PARTICULARLY HIGH LOW CHANCE OF FINDING A WELL PAYING JOB IN GERMANY
POSTED THIS ON ONE OF THESE THREADS A FEW WEEKS AGO BUT IT WAS TOO LATE TO GET A RESPONSE

MY UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE IS IN DISCRETE MATHEMATICS AND I AM MIDWAY THROUGH A JOINT MASTERS PHD IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE WHERE I COULD LEAVE AFTER THE MASTERS I HAVE DONE RESEARCH IN SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING AND AM CONSIDERING SWITCHING TO THIS FIELD SPECIFICALLY COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS AND FINISHING A PHD AS YOU MAY NOTICE MY MATH BACKGROUND IS NOT IN AN AREA THAT IS TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH PHYSICS DOES ANYONE HERE HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE COMING FROM A SIMILAR BACKGROUND AND GOING INTO PHYSICS OR SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING IN GENERAL ANY ADVICE ON THIS AND MATERIALS TO FILL OUT MY MATHEMATICS KNOWLEDGE WOULD BE WELCOME

THANKS IN ADVANCE
I AM IN THE PROCESS OF APPLYING TO GRAD SCHOOLS I HAVE GOOD GRADES GA PHYSICS MEMBER OF MY HONORS COLLEGE AND AM DOING ONGOING RESEARCH IN STELLAR PHYSICS NO CHANCE OF PUBLICATION THIS YEAR STILL TOO MUCH TO DO I THINK I DID FAIRLY WELL ON THE GRE BUT WON'T KNOW FOR SURE UNTIL TEST SCORES COME BACK I AM ALSO UNDECIDED ON WHAT MY SPECIALTY SHOULD BE BUT I HAVE BEEN LEANING MORE TOWARDS COSMOLOGY WHAT ARE SOME GOOD SCHOOLS I MAY BE UNAWARE OF PREFERABLY ON THE WEST COAST I AM FAIRLY SURE I WILL BE APPLYING TO BOULDER AND STANFORD UNLESS MY GRE SCORES COME BACK LOW DOES UNIVERSITY OF OREGON HAVE A GOOD COSMOLOGY PROGRAM

ALSO MY BACHELORS HAS A SECONDARY EDUCATION EMPHASIS ON IT AND I WILL HAVE YEARS EXPERIENCING TEACHING PHYSICS LABS AND HIGH SCHOOL PHYSICS BY THE TIME I GRADUATE WILL THIS HELP ME STAND OUT AMONG GENERIC PHYSICS DEGREES AND WILL THIS HELP ME GET A TA POSITION
HELLO ALL I AM NEW TO THIS SUBREDDIT

I AM A PHYSICS MAJOR CURRENTLY IN MY FINAL YEAR OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND WILL BE APPLYING TO TRANSFER FOR NEXT FALL I AM IN THE PROCESS OF FINISHING THE CALCULUS MATH AND PHYSICS COURSES AT MY COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND I WAS WONDERING WHAT TYPE OF CLASSES I SHOULD BE EXPECTING TO TAKE ONCE I TRANSFER I AM CURRENTLY INTERESTED IN ASTROPHYSICS BUT AM PLANNING ON A GENERAL OR EVEN ENGINEERING TRACK

I LIVE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND WILL BE APPLYING TO THE AND CAL STATES ANY ADVICE ON PRIVATE SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE GOOD UNDERGRADUATE PHYSICS PROGRAMS I WILL MOST LIKELY STAY IN STATE BUT I AM ALSO INTERESTED IN SCHOOLS

THANKS IN ADVANCE
I NEED FINALLY CHOOSE MY SPECIALISATION CURRENTLY I HAVE TWO OPTION ONE IS TO WRITE MY THESIS IN QUANTUM INFORMATION THEORY IT'S SOMETHING WHAT I REALLY ENJOY BUT STILL EXTREMELY IS DIFFICULT FOR ME
ON THE OTHER HAND IS SOLID STATE PHYSICS WITH AN APPLICATION IN NUCLEAR PHYSICS THIS OPTION IS MORE CONVENIENT AND EASIER
IN SUMMERY QUANTUM INFORMATION THEORY SOUNDS MORE INTERESTING BUT IT IS HARD SOLID STATES IS NOT LIKE AREN'T INTERESTING AT ALL BUT STILL NOT THAT INTERESTING BUT SEEMS TO HAVE MORE APPLICATIONS AND WORK OPPORTUNITIES ANY ADVICE HOW TO MAKE THIS HARD CHOISE

THANKS IN ADVANCE
SO I WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH NASA AND AM CONCERNED THAT TRUMP WANTS TO PUT A HIRING FREEZE ON FEDERAL EMPLOYEES

DOES THIS MEAN THAT I WON'T BE ABLE TO GET A JOB WITH NASA
I AM GETTING A DIVORCE AND HAVE A ONE YEAR OLD THIS HAS CHANGED MY PLANS FROM ACEDIAMIN TO NOW LOOKING TO ENTER THE FINANCIAL SECTOR WHEN I GRADUATE I HAVE ABOUT TO 2 YEARS LEFT ON MY PHD

WHAT SHOULD I DO OVER MY REMAINING TIME TO MAKE MYSELF THE MOST MARKETABLE WHEN I GRADUATE

I HAVE A BIT OF EXPERIENCE WORKING AS A RUNNER CLERK AT THE MERC WHEN I WAS YOUNGER
CAN ANYONE TELL ME IF THESE NUMBERS LOOK RIGHT THEY SHOULD BE ACCEPTANCE RATES FOR PHYSICS PROGRAMS IN VARIOUS SCHOOLS

GRADSCHOOL Q 2 CID

MIT AND HARVARD ACCEPTING SEEMS A BIT HIGH TO ME
I'M THINKING ABOUT DOING A MASTER'S DEGREE IN FRANCE PMC SPECIFICALLY IF ANYONE HERE HAS EXPERIENCE WITH THE APPLICATION PROCESS FROM THE U SOUTH IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HEAR FROM YOU WHICH UNIVERSITY DID YOU APPLY TO WHAT WERE YOUR CREDENTIALS WERE THE CLASSES TO BE TAUGHT IN FRENCH HOW WERE YOU GOING TO PAY FOR IT
WHICH ARE THE BEST COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES TO STUDY PHYSICS
TYPICALLY YOU WANT TO BLOW AIR AT THE CHIMNEY PIPE JUST ABOVE THE STOVE THIS GIVES YOU THE MAXIMUM HEAT EXCHANGE AND RECOVERS SOME OF THE HEAT THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE LOST THROUGH THE CHIMNEY

IF YOU LOOK UP WOOD STOVE HEAT EXCHANGER YOU WILL SEE A WIDE VARIETY OF CONTRAPTIONS DESIGNED TO DO JUST THIS THAT SAID MODERN WOOD STOVES OFTEN HAVE A JACKET WITH A BUILT IN FAN FOR EXACTLY THIS REASON IF YOURS HAS THE JACKET BUT NOT THE FAN TRY BLOWING AIR INTO THE OPENING YOU CAN TELL IT IS WORKING IF THE CHIMNEY COOLS DOWN SOMEWHAT CHECK WITH A PYROMETER NOT YOUR HAND
BLOW THE FAN AT THE STOVE IF YOU BLOW IT AWAY FROM THE STOVE YOU RUN A MARGINAL RISK OF HEAT DAMAGE TO THE BACK OF THE FAN BUT IN GENERAL THE BEST WAY TO EVENLY DISTRIBUTE THE HEAT IS TO PUT THE FAN IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM BLOWING STRAIGHT UP AT THE CEILING
THIS JOURNAL HAS A SUBREDDIT AT R QUANTUMJOURNAL AND THE BOARD WILL BE DOING AN AMA ON R SCIENCE NEXT MONDAY
TO ME IS A GOOD STEP THERE WILL ALWAYS BE QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INTEGRITY AND VALIDITY OF METHODS AND RESULTS BUT GETTING MORE INFORMATION OUT THERE CAN ONLY BE BENEFICIAL ESPECIALLY IF THOSE PAPERS ALLOW FOR NEGATIVE NULL RESULTS IN SCIENCE A LOT OF MY PEERS ARE AFRAID OF PUBLISHING IF IT DOESN'T MEET THEIR FUNDING CRITERIA GOALS IF SAY A GROUP IS GOING DOWN ONE PATH AND DECIDES IT'S NOT SUCCESSFUL THEY CAN AT LEAST POINT TO PUBLICATIONS IN THIS ARENA TO SAY TO THEIR FUNDING COMMITTEES WE NEED TO TRY ALTERNATIVES
YOU KNOW YOU'VE BECOME A PHYSICIST WHEN YOU READ THE ARTICLE AND GO HEY I'VE TALKED TO THAT PERSON
THIS IS STRANGE I HAVE NOT HEARD OF THE RELATION BEFORE BUT IT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME THAT DARK MATTER DISTRIBUTION SHOULD BE SO STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH THE BARYONIC MATTER DISTRIBUTION WITH THE ASSUMPTION OF DARK MATTER WHICH ONLY ONLY HAVE SOME WEAK INTERACTION ALSO DO WE KNOW IF THIS WORKS WITH DRAGON FLY THE PERCENT DARK MATTER GALAXY
THE PAPER IN NRL
NRL ABSTRACT AND PREPRINT ON ARXIV
YES I BELIEVE THIS HAS BEEN POSTED BEFORE OR PERHAPS IN ANOTHER SUBREDDIT AND SOME PAPERS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS TRYING TO EXPLAIN IT THE OVERALL CONCLUSION IS THAT WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIT THAT WITH THE CURRENT DARK MATTER PARADIGM WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHY THIS LAW SHOULD ARISE AND SIMULATIONS OF GALAXY FORMATION HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DECISIVELY DEMONSTRATE IT

MODIFIED NEWTONIAN GRAVITY MOND DOES MATCH THIS TO A T BUT MOND HAS ITS OWN ISSUES THAT HAVE YET TO BE RESOLVED ACOUSTIC PEAKS MOSTLY THE BULLET CLUSTER ISN'T THAT PROBLEMATIC
FOR OTHERS LIKE ME WHO WEREN'T CERTAIN EXACTLY WHAT THE TITLE WAS REFERRING TO WHEN TALKING ABOUT THE GENERIC ROTATION OF A DISK GALAXY

MCGAUGH BELLI AND SCHOMBERT HAVE DISPLAYED A REMARKABLY SIMPLE RELATION BETWEEN THE RADIAL DISTRIBUTION OF VISIBLE MATTER IN DISK GALAXIES AND THE RADIAL DEPENDENCE OF THE ROTATIONAL VELOCITY



IF YOU KNOW THE CENTRIPETAL ACCELERATION AT A GIVEN RADIUS EXPECTED FROM THE GRAVITY OF THE VISIBLE MATTER IN THE DISK YOU THEN ALSO KNOW THE ACTUAL ACCELERATION AT THAT RADIUS EVEN THOUGH IN MANY CASES IT IS MOSTLY DETERMINED BY THE DARK MATTER THE AUTHORS SHOW THAT DATA FOR ALL DISK GALAXIES FALL ON THE SAME CURVE SEE FIGURATIVE BOTTOM INDIVIDUAL GALAXIES FALL ALONG DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF THE CURVE DEPENDING ON THEIR DISK MASS AND SURFACE BRIGHTNESS THIS REMARKABLE RELATION INCLUDES GALAXIES SPANNING FACTORS OF IN DISK MASS AND IN DISK DENSITY
WHAT EVEN IN THE HELL
DOES ANY CLOSED SYSTEM HAVE LIMITED PERTURBATIONS AND THEREFORE A GOD'S NUMBER OR FINITE SET OF LOWEST ENERGY STATES

NO THERE IS NO PRINCIPLE THAT GENERALLY LIMITS THE NUMBER OF STATES A SYSTEM CAN HAVE SYSTEMS WITH A CONTINUOUS SYMMETRY CAN HAVE AN ENTIRE INFINITY OF DEGENERATE GROUND STATES THE UNITARY THREE BOSON PROBLEM WITH INTERACTION HAS AN ACCUMULATION OF BODY BOUND STATES AT ENERGY THERE ARE INFINITELY MANY WITHIN ANY FINITE WINDOW OF THIS IS THE FAMOUS EFREMOV EFFECT

WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE AND PERTURBATION THEORY

THERE IS NO RELATIONSHIP THAT I KNOW OF WHAT DID YOU HAVE IN MIND
IS A SOLVED CUBE IN A HIGH OR LOW STATE OF ENTROPY

THE SOLVED RUBIES CUBE HAS ENTROPY S BECAUSE THERE IS ONLY ONE POSSIBLE CONFIGURATION OF CUBES TO MAKE THAT STATE THAT IS NOT ESPECIALLY INTERESTING THOUGH BECAUSE EVERY RUBIES CUBE CONFIGURATION HAS S

DOES ANY CLOSED SYSTEM HAVE LIMITED PERTURBATIONS

I AM NOT EXACTLY SURE IF I'M ANSWERING THIS CORRECTLY BUT I THINK WHEN SAYING CLOSED SYSTEM YOU MAY MEAN SYSTEM IN EQUILIBRIUM IN THIS CASE THE SYSTEM'S ENERGY DOES VARY BY A SMALL AMOUNT FROM ITS AVERAGE ENERGY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PERTURBATIONS THOUGH USUALLY WE ARE STARTING KNOWING THE ANSWER TO A SIMPLER PROBLEM AND THEN IF WE JUST CHANGE THE SYSTEM A LITTLE BIT I EAST APPLY A MAGNETIC FIELD THEN WE CAN APPROXIMATE THE NEW SOLUTION BY SLIGHTLY ALTERING THE KNOWN SOLUTION
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED GOING IN FOR HELP AND ASKING YOUR TEACHER PROFESSOR FOR AN EXPLANATION
PHYSICS IS THEORY CONCEPTUAL AND APPLICATION OF THOSE THEORIES IN REAL LIFE IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY SOMETHING WORKS THE WAY IT DOES THEN IT MAY HELP TO HAVE YOUR PROFESSOR EXPLAIN MORE AND DO LOTS OF PRACTICE PROBLEMS TO GET BETTER
BUY THIS IT CHANGED MY LIFE IF YOU HAVE STRUGGLE TO REMEMBER REALLY CHEAP
DP

OTHERWISE CAN YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC IN WHAT ARE YOUR STRUGGLES MEMORY MATH OR WHAT
YOU MIGHT BENEFIT FROM THIS I AM NOT SURE
WATCH V DKM

ALSO SINCE IT IS MECHANICS TRY TO SOLVE AS MANY PROBLEMS AS YOU CAN THE MORE PROBLEMS YOU SOLVE THE MORE CONFIDENCE YOU WILL BUILDING ONE OF THE BOOK I FOUND USEFUL IS
DETAILS SCHAUMSTHEORYANDPROBLEMSOFTHEORETICALMECHANICS

GIVE IT A SHOT
WHY DON'T YOU JUST STUDY LONGER
PERSONALLY I THINK YOU SHOULD STUDY FOR MORE THAN A SINGLE HOUR FOR ANY CLASSICAL I TYPICALLY SAY THAT FOR EVERY HOUR I AM PHYSICALLY IN CLASS I SHOULD STUDY AN ADDITIONAL HOURS OUTSIDE OF CLASS AT MINIMUM FURTHERMORE WHEN IT COMES TO PHYSICS I FIND IT BEST TO DO ASSIGNED HOMEWORK FIRST AND THEN TRY DOING THE PROBLEMS AT THE END OF THE CHAPTER I ALSO ALL OF MY NOTES IMMEDIATELY AFTER CLASSICAL
ISN'T THAT FIELD INCREDIBLY COMPETITIVE AT THE MOMENT ACCEPTING TO OF APPLICANTS MIGHT NOT BE THE MOST SECURE PROSPECT
THIS IS MY BACK UP CAREER IF I GET BORED OF ACADEMIA IT'S ACTUALLY WHAT I ORIGINALLY WANTED TO DO MY DEGREE IN BUT AT THE TIME MEDICAL PHYSICS WASN'T OFFERED WHERE I WAS MAY I ASK WHAT COUNTRY YOURE IN AND HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS TO FIND A POSITION

EDIT BY BACK UP CAREER I MEAN SECOND CHOICE I ONLY CHOSE THE PHD OVER A MEDICAL PHYSICS MASTERS FOR FINANCIAL REASONS
I PLAN ON STUDYING MEDICAL PHYSICS SOON CURRENTLY IN MY THIRD YEAR OF MY BS IN NUCLEAR ENGINEERING I HAVE SHADOWED A CLINICAL PHYSICIST AND HAVE SPOKEN WITH MANY PEOPLE IN THE DEPARTMENT AT MY UNIVERSITY AND AM POSITIVE THIS IS THE CAREER FOR ME I WOULD APPRECIATE SOME MORE INFORMATION FROM YOU ABOUT HOW YOU GOT INTO THE FIELD AND GRADUATE SCHOOLS AS I AM GOING TO BE APPLYING SOON
ONE THING TO NOTE IS THAT IN THE CANONICAL ENSEMBLE ONE DOES NOT ASSUME THAT EVERY MICRO STATE IS EQUALLY LIKELY ONLY THAT MICROSTATES WHICH ALL CORRESPOND TO THE SAME MICROSTATE ARE EQUALLY LIKELY FROM THERE IT MAY BE A LITTLE MORE CLEAR HOW SYSTEMS ARISE
IT'S A FAIRLY BROAD QUESTION BUT ERGODICITY BREAKING IS ONE OF THE MAIN MECHANISMS OF A PHASE TRANSITION ESSENTIALLY YOU HAVE STATES OF THE SAME ENERGY AND YET THE SYSTEM HAS NO MEANS TO MOVE FROM ONE TO THE OTHER AND ACCESSIBLE PHASE SPACE GETS FRACTURED SPLIT-UP DIVIDED THE CAUSE OF THIS IS A SPONTANEOUSLY BROKEN SYMMETRY

WIKI


THIS PAPER SAYS CHAOTIC MOTION DRIVES ERGODICITY SO IT MAY DEPEND ON IF THE SYSTEM BECOMES CHAOTIC AS TIME PASSES
PHYS JOURNAL FULL
FOR THE STAT MECH I HAD A PROFESSOR WHO WAS PRETTY IN TO DISCUSSING THE VALIDITY OF THIS ASSUMPTION THE LAW OF EQUAL A PRIORI THE CLOSEST THING WE GOT TO PROOF WAS THE H THEOREM WHICH IS BASICALLY A PROOF THAT IT WORKS FOR SINGLE PARTICLE SYSTEMS

TEACHING THERMALHTML
FIRST A WARNING I WAS PLANNING TO DO EXACTLY THIS NOW I TEACH MATHEMATICS I'M STILL NOT ENTIRELY SURE HOW THAT HAPPENED

YOU WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY TAKE COURSES IN ABSTRACT ALGEBRA GROUPS AND FIELDS ARE EACH VERY USEFUL AND REAL ANALYSIS MEASURE THEORY MAKE SURE TO TAKE A COURSE THAT GETS INTO FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS AS WELL HILBERT SPACE AND THINGS WHICH BEHAVE SIMILARLY

I PROBABLY DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU THAT COURSES IN DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OR IN NUMERICAL ANALYSIS WILL BE HELPFUL

I WISH THAT I HAD TAKEN A COURSE IN NON-EUCLIDEAN OR DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY BUT IT KEPT BEING CANCELLED FOR LOW ENROLLMENT SO I CAN'T TELL YOU MORE ON THAT UNFORTUNATELY
THE FOLLOWING IS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A STRING THEORIST SO IT HAS A CERTAIN BUILT IN BIAS DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY IS FOR SURE VERY USEFUL BOTH THE BASICS MANIFOLDS RIEMANNIAN GEOMETRY BUNDLES AND CERTAIN MORE ADVANCED THINGS AS WELL LIKE INDEX THEOREMS SYMPLECTIC STRUCTURE COMPLEX STRUCTURE CHARACTERISTIC CLASSES ETC GROUP THEORY AND REPRESENTATION THEORY OF GROUPS IS ALSO FUNDAMENTAL ESPECIALLY LIE GROUPS AND LIE ALGEBRAS SOME BASICS OF DIFFERENTIAL TOPOLOGY AND ALGEBRAIC TOPOLOGY IS ALSO USEFUL ONE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT HOMOLOGY COHOMOLOGY HOMOTOPY GROUPS AND SO ON


I DON'T THINK FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS IS THAT USEFUL BEYOND THE VERY BASICS IT NEVER REALLY SHOWS UP IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS SAME THING ABOUT REAL ANALYSIS AND ABOUT STUDYING ODES PDES YOU SHOULD KNOW THE BASICS ABOUT THESE THINGS BUT A FULL MATH COURSE IS PROBABLY WAY OVERKILL FOR MOST OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS THEORETICAL PHYSICIST USUALLY JUST ASSUMES THAT THINGS WORK AND THAT YOUR OBJECTS ARE NICE EXISTS ETC SO A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT MATHEMATICIANS STUDY AND CARE ABOUT IN THESE AREAS ARE JUST IGNORED WHEN DOING PHYSICS ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY IS ANOTHER TOPIC THAT DOES HAVE A LOT OF USES IN STRING THEORY BUT IT'S FOR SURE NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF PHYSICS YOU WANT TO GET BACK INTO FOR THE MOST PART THE CURSE OF THE MATH CLASSES IS THAT YOU CAN GET A MUCH CLEARER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN PHYSICAL THEORIES BUT BASICALLY NONE OF IT WILL GIVE YOU TOOLS THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE IN YOUR WORK UNLESS YOU BECOME A MATHEMATICAL PHYSICIST BASICALLY ALL MATHEMATICS CLASSES ABOVE THE INTRODUCTORY LEVEL RELY ON A STRUCTURE THE TRICKS AND TOOLS THAT THEY TEACH YOU ARE THE THINGS YOU NEED TO PROVE THEOREMS BUT PROVING THEOREMS IS NOT WHAT WE DO IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS MOST OF WHAT WE DO IS ACTUALLY SOLVING MODELS INVENTING TRICKS THAT LET US CALCULATE THINGS ETC JUST TO BE CLEAR I'M DOING A PHD IN AMO THEORY SO THAT'S WHERE MY BIAS WILL BE

DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY REALLY ONLY COMES INTO PLAY IF YOU'RE DOING PHYSICS MAYBE GENERAL RELATIVITY OR PHYSICS BEYOND THE STANDARD MODEL STRING THEORY INCLUDED

I AGREE WITH WHAT U HOPFFIBER SAID ABOUT FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS AND REAL ANALYSIS YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND A BIT BEYOND THE BASIC LEVEL IF YOU'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON IN QUANTUM MECHANICS OR DYNAMICS BUT IT BASICALLY NEVER COMES UP IN OUR DAY-TO-DAY WORK

COMPLEX ANALYSIS IS VERY IMPORTANT WE USE IT ALL THE TIME I'VE EVER USED SOME OF THE STUFF YOU MIGHT NOT SEE UNTIL A GRADUATE COURSE LIKE WEIERSTRASS PRODUCTS

GROUPS AND THEIR REPRESENTATIONS COME UP A LOT THIS INCLUDE BOTH THE FINITE GROUPS WHICH COME UP IN A CONDENSED MATTER AND AMO CONTEXT AND THE LIE GROUPS WHICH ARE EVERYWHERE MOSTLY THOUGH WE CARE ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT MATHEMATICIANS CARE ABOUT PARTICULARLY MUCH OF PHYSICS WORKS WITH REPRESENTATIONS OF LIE GROUPS AND THAT THEORY ISN'T ALWAYS WHOLLY COVERED IN MATH CLASSES IT ISN'T EXACTLY THE EASIEST CASE

ASYMPTOTIC ANALYSIS PERTURBATION APPROACHES ETC THERE IS A WHOLE RANGE OF THEORY ABOUT HOW TO APPLY POWERFUL APPROXIMATE TECHNIQUES TO SOLVE PROBLEMS NOT EVERY MATH DEPARTMENT WILL TEACH THEM HERE I'M TALKING ABOUT REGULAR PERTURBATION THEORY SINGULAR PERTURBATIONS ANALYSIS UNIFORM EXPANSIONS LIKE KB THEORY ASYMPTOTIC EXPANSION OF INTEGRALS MELLIN METHODS STEEPEST DESCENT STATIONARY PHASE ETC ETC

FOURIER THEORY HARMONIC ANALYSIS THEORY OF DISTRIBUTIONS THIS STUFF COMES UP A LOT IN QUANTUM MECHANICS YOU DON'T HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO PROVE A LOT OF THEOREMS BUT IT IS HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON WHEN YOU SAY SCATTERING STATES ARE NORMALIZED TO A YOU GET SOME BETTER HANDLE ON WHAT SPACE QUANTUM STATES ACTUALLY LIVE IN BECAUSE IT'S ONLY A TRUE HILBERT SPACE FOR BOUND STATES AND IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU NEED TO KNOW ALL THE TRICKS FOR HOW TO CALCULATE FOURIER TRANSFORMS AND SUCH
LET'S SEE MOSTLY DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS SOMETHING ABOUT LIE ALGEBRAS TOO POPS UP EVERYWHERE SOMETHING WITH THE ADJECTIVE SYMPLECTIC

A MATHEMATICIAN WILL LIKELY DO SOME OF THOSE STILL IN A BACHELOR PROGRAMME BUT NOT ALL OF THEM AND WILL LIKELY DO THE REST IN A MASTER PROGRAMME IF HE SPECIALIZES IN THIS SOURCE DID A DOUBLE MATH PHYSICS
MY RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TO LEARN ADVANCED NUMERICAL METHODS THAT WILL HELP YOU IN MANY DIFFERENT FIELDS OF PHYSICS AND IS ALSO GOING TO BE USEFUL FOR YOU AFTER GRAD SCHOOL WHEN FINDING A JOB

IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE IT DEPENDS ON WHAT FIELD OF PHYSICS YOU ARE INTERESTED IN OTHER COMMENTS HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS
YOU DEFINITELY NEED TO GET SOME CD UNDER YOUR BELT AS YOU'VE JUST STARTED GRAD SCHOOL I'M ASSUMING YOU WON'T NEED TO DIVE INTO THE BELLY OF THE BEAST SO ANY INTRODUCTORY COURSE ON PARTICLE PHYSICS SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT

I LIKE AITCHISON AND HEY VOL 2 QUARKS AND LEPTONS BY HALDEN MARTIN AND MAYBE GAUGE THEORIES BY QUIGG FOR A VERY CONCISE BUT CLEAR INTRODUCTION READ UP ON SPONTANEOUS SYMMETRY BREAKING AS WELL WHICH SHOULD BE COVERED IN ANY OF THOSE AND THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST A WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF CD

THEN YOU CAN JUMP RIGHT INTO IT I THINK THIS IS PAPER A GOOD STARTING POINT

AS A SIDENOTE I WOULD STAY CLEAR OF THE BIG HITTERS SUCH AS PESKIN AND SCHROEDER OR SCHWARTZ FOR YOUR FIRST INTRODUCTION THEY'RE GREAT FOR A SECOND PASS OVER THE SUBJECT BUT CAN BE CONFUSING IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST EXPOSURE

THE BGP IS VERY CONFUSING IN NATURE AND EXPERIMENTALLY IT IS A MESS FOR EXAMPLE ALL THE JET QUENCHING RESULTS FROM STAR COLLABORATION CIRCA ARE WRONG THE SUSPECT DISAPPEARANCE OF THESE JETS IN COLLISIONS APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN A COMBINATION OF EXPERIMENTAL AND BASIC MODELING TROUBLE

UNFORTUNATELY THESE RESULTS WERE HYPED UP AND THEY HAVE BEEN WIDELY DISSEMINATED BUTT THIS ERRATA HAS NOT SO BE CAREFUL WITH ANY EARLY CLAIMS RELATING TO JET PHYSICS

NOBODY REALLY UNDERSTANDS THE BGP AND WE REALLY DON'T KNOW IF IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED

A RELATIVISTIC CORRECTION CAN AT MOST GO AS V C ACTUALLY YOU CAN SHOW IN THIS CASE IT'S AT LEAST V C 2 BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER THE CORRECTION DUE TO DARK MATTER TO THE ROTATION CURVE IS VERY LARGE OF ORDER AFTER A CERTAIN RADIUS THE REAL CURVE AND THAT PREDICTED BY BARYONIC MATTER ONLY ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

THUS SINCE V C IN FACT V C FOR TYPICAL GALAXIES THIS OR ANY OTHER RELATIVISTIC CORRECTIONS CANNOT BE IT
U SCHROGENDIDDY IS RIGHT

ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT THE VIRIAL THEOREM WHICH MAY HELP CLEAR SOME THINGS UP
CAN YOU POST IT IN THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE AS WELL
THANKS I REALLY ENJOYED THIS LITTLE STORY AND ADMIRE THE CHARM OF THE TEACHER'S SPONTANEOUS POETIC REPLY
AT THE END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY KELVIN STATED THAT THE ONLY TASK REMAINING FOR PHYSICISTS WAS TO MAKE MORE AND MORE PRECISE MEASUREMENTS

ONLY THIRTY YEARS LATER WE DISCOVERED QUANTUM MECHANICS

THERE IS FAR MORE THAT WE DON'T KNOW WE DON'T KNOW THAN THERE IS THAT WE KNOW WE DON'T KNOW
A PHYSICS BOOK I CHANCED TO REVIEW FROM THE CENTURY PREDICTED THE IMMINENT END OF OPTICS

BUT THEN THE AUTHOR MISSED OUT ON MATERIALS AND LASERS AND SUCH
TINDER FOR THE SPARK LIKE BUILDING A FIRE NOT TIMBER


HOPEFULLY THAT'S AUTOCORRECTS FAULT AND NOT WHAT THE GUY ACTUALLY SAID
JUST FOR POSTERITY HOW DID IT SOUND IN THE ORIGINAL
PHYSICS WILL CONTINUE WHETHER THERE WILL BE HUMANS AROUND TO STUDY IT AFTER THIS ELECTION IS GUESS
JESUS THAT'S BEAUTIFUL

THAT KID PROBABLY HASN'T READ ENOUGH PHYSICS TO SEE THAT EVERY TIME WE THINK WE'RE CLOSE WE OPEN ANOTHER RABBIT HOLE


FUNDING MIGHT END
SWIPE RIGHT
DELETED
SOMEONE ONCE SAID IN THE EARLY THAT PHYSICS WAS SOLVED AND NOTHING MORE WAS NEEDED EXCEPT MORE PRECISE MEASUREMENTS

THEN CAME ALONG AND OUT POPPED SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND THE PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT LEADING TO QM
WAS IT IN URDU
THERE IS A STORY ABOUT MAX PLANCK WHEN HE COULDN'T DECIDE WHAT TO STUDY SOMEBODY TOLD HIM TO GO INTO BIOLOGY OR SOME SIMILAR SCIENCE AS PHYSICS IS DONE AND THE ONLY THING LEFT TO DO IS TO IMPROVE MEASUREMENTS OF CONSTANTS AND SUCH

THAT WAS AT THE END OF THE CENTURY AND WE ALL KNOW HOW THE STORY ENDS
THE ORIGINAL VERSE IS BY ONE OF THE GREATEST MODERN POETS OF URDU AND PERSIAN SIR MUHAMMAD IQBAL THE IDEOLOGICAL FATHER AND NATIONAL POET OF PAKISTAN


ALSO WHAT A TERRIBLE ANALOGY PHILOSOPHY HASN'T HAD A LOT OF PROGRESS COMPARED WITH SCIENCES FROM VIEWPOINT THEY ARE WITH SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT IN MANY BRANCHES
SOME TIME AGO I WAS A ASI FOR A PHYSICS LAB SECTION AN UNDERGRAD IN MY CLASS WAS SURPRISED TO FIND OUT THAT I WAS A PHYSICS GRADUATE STUDENT ACTUALLY STUDYING PHYSICS SHE SAID REALLY WHAT IS THERE LEFT TO KNOW IN ALL SERIOUSNESS I'M NOT AS POETIC AS YOUR PROFESSOR BUT I MANAGED TO SAY SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF REALLY WE'VE ONLY JUST SCRATCHED THE SURFACE

DELAYING A CLASS HAS ZERO IMPACT ON YOUR CAREER ESPECIALLY ON THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN INTRODUCTION SHORT DELAY IN GRADUATION MAYBE
I'M NOT A PHYSICS GRAD BUT I HAVE SOME GENERAL ADVICE FOR YOU IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESEARCH EXPERIENCE FOR A PHD THEN YOU CAN CONSIDER GOING A MASTERS FIRST TO TEST THE WATERS SO TO SPEAK
TALK TO YOUR ACADEMIC ADVISER THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO ME WITH DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS I ABSOLUTELY NEEDED IT THAT SEMESTER BECAUSE I WOULD FOLLOW IT UP WITH COURSES TAUGHT ONCE EVERY OTHER YEAR MY ADVISER TALKED TO THE COURSE INSTRUCTOR AND ADDED A SEAT FOR ME
RUN THIS BY YOUR ACADEMIC ADVISER

CAN YOU TAKE YOUR CALC BASED PHYSICS 2 COURSE OVER THE SUMMER PERHAPS YOUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAN HELP YOU OUT WITH THAT JUST MAKE SURE IT'LL TRANSFER IN I DON'T SEE WHY IT WOULDN'T PHYSICS II IS PRETTY CONSISTENT

MY LOCAL CC OFFERS PLENTY OF LEVEL COURSES THAT TRANSFER TO MOST EVERY SUNY SCHOOL AS IS I'M IN NY I TOOK A FEW MATH COURSES THERE DURING SUMMER SESSIONS TO LIGHTEN MY SEMESTER LOAD MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE WALKING INTO MY MATH METHODS OF PHYSICS CLASS HAVING ALREADY TAKEN LINEAR ALGEBRA AND DIFF EQ
A INTERESTING VIDEO ABOUT A TOPIC I HAVE BEEN WORKING IN FOR THE LAST FEW MONTHS

AN INTERESTING NOTE TO THIS VIDEO IS SOME TOPICS ARE FAR FROM MODELED CORRECTLY WITH HIGH ENOUGH ACCURACY TO BE IN PRACTICAL USE FOR EXAMPLE IT IS STILL VERY HARD TO PREDICT SEDIMENT TRANSPORT
FIRST QUANTUM MECHANICS IS NOT AT ALL LIKE A MONITOR QM IS FILLED WITH CONTINUOUS VALUES AT THE VERY MATHEMATICAL LEVEL I EAST THE AMPLITUDES AND AT LEAST FOR NOW IN ITS APPLICATION TO PHYSICS EAST G POSITIONS ARE REPRESENTED BY A CONTINUOUS VECTOR SPACE IT IS NOT AT ALL INDICATIVE OF GRAININESS IN FACT BEFORE QUANTUM ERROR CORRECTING CODES WERE DISCOVERED PEOPLE USED LACK OF GRANULARITY AS AN ARGUMENT AGAINST QUANTUM COMPUTERS EVER BEING PRACTICAL PLUS MAKING A CLASSICAL SIMULATION MORE EFFICIENT BY THROWING IN QM IS QUITE POSSIBLY THE WORST OPTIMIZATION I'VE EVER HEARD OF QM IS SUPER EXPENSIVE TO SIMULATE

SECOND INFERENCE REQUIRES A BONKING HUGE DIFFERENCE IN CONDITIONAL EXPECTATION OR REPEATED INDEPENDENT TESTS TO GET ANYWHERE NEAR CERTAINTY DO YOU EXPECT THAT THE GROUND FLOOR UNIVERSE HAS REALLY TRULY CONTINUOUS VALUES PUT ODDS ON IT KEEP IN MIND THAT EAST G RICHARD FEYNMAN WAS BOTHERED BY HAVING TO CANCEL OUT INFINITIES IN ELECTROMAGNETISM IN THE CONTINUOUS LIMIT AND SUSPECTED THAT THE SOLUTION COULD BE A OF SOME KIND NOW PUT ODDS ON HOW LIKELY IT WOULD BE FOR A SIMULATION TO BE GRANULAR WE DO TRY TO DO CONTINUOUS SIMULATIONS SOMETIMES BY THE WAY EAST G TURNING THE GAME OF LIFE INTO SMOOTHLIFE AND WE CAN AT LEAST WRITE COMPUTER PROGRAMS THAT CONVERGE ON THE CONTINUOUS CASE AND IF THE GROUND FLOOR REALITY IS REALLY TRULY CONTINUOUS IN A NOTICEABLE WAY THERE'S ALL THE MORE INCENTIVE FOR THE SIMULATIONS TO HAVE THAT PROPERTY

LET'S ARBITRARILY CALL OUR PRIOR FOR GRAININESS GIVEN THAT WE'RE ON THE GROUND FLOOR TO BE AGAINST AND OUR PRIOR FOR GRAININESS GIVEN SIMULATION TO BE FOR ALSO ARBITRARILY ASSUME THAT WE'RE TOTALLY UNSURE IF WE'RE ON THE GROUND FLOOR OR NOT WE PUT THE ODDS OF THAT AT SUPPOSE WE FIND OUT DEFINITIVELY THAT THE UNIVERSE IS GRAINY WE DO A BAYESIAN UPDATE AND FIND THAT OUR POSTERIOR ODDS ARE OUR INITIAL CHANCE OF GROUND FLOOR WAS REDUCED TO CHANCE OF GROUND FLOOR

RECALL THAT PREDICTED ONLY A CHANCE OF TRUMP WINNING THE PRESIDENCY

SEE THE PROBLEM EVEN AFTER YOU FIND OUT THE UNIVERSE IS GRAINY THERE'S STILL TOO MUCH UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE IN A SIMULATION TO REALLY CALL IT AND WE ONLY GET TO BE SURPRISED BY THE GRAININESS ONCE WE CAN'T JUST KEEP CHECKING IT AGAIN AND AGAIN TO PUSH THE PROBABILITY FURTHER WE'D HAVE TO FIND DOZENS OF OTHER INDEPENDENT PREDICTIONS WITH AS MUCH DIFFERENCE IN CONDITIONAL EXPECTATION AS THE GRAININESS TO GET TO THE SIGMA STANDARD IN PHYSICS EAST G WITH A SIMULATION YOU'D EXPECT REALITY TO BE INSTEAD OF SIZED AND I JUST DON'T SEE US FINDING THAT MANY INDEPENDENT THINGS TO CHECK UNLESS WE FIND OURSELVES LITERALLY HACKING INTO REALITY AND READING OFF THE CODE BIT BY BIT

OVERALL I GUESS I'D SAY ANYONE WHO THINKS FINDING OUT REALITY IS GRANULAR WOULD PROVE WE'RE IN A SIMULATION EITHER DOESN'T UNDERSTAND BAYESIAN INFERENCE OR IS TRAGICALLY OVERCONFIDENT IN THEIR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON AT GROUND LEVEL
IN MY OPINION THIS QUESTION CAN SCIENCE PROVE DISPROVE THE SIMULATION HYPOTHESIS SUFFERS FROM MANY OF THE SAME PROBLEMS AS THE OFTEN DEBATED QUESTION CAN SCIENCE PROVE DISPROVE THE EXISTENCE OF GOD HOW IS THE IDEA THAT WE LIVE IN A SIMULATED WORLD CREATED BY A PROGRAMER OR TEAM OF PROGRAMERS THAT DIFFERENT FROM THE IDEA THAT WE LIVE IN A WORLD CREATED BY A DIVINE BEING OR TEAM OF DIVINE BEINGS

THE ONE DIFFERENCE IS THAT WE KNOW THAT NUMERICAL METHODS INTRODUCE ERRORS DUE TO THE APPROXIMATIONS THAT ARE MADE THE PROBLEM IS DIFFERENT METHODS INTRODUCE DIFFERENT TYPES OF ERRORS AND THESE ERRORS OFTEN LOOK LIKE DIFFERENT PHYSICAL PHENOMENA FOR EXAMPLE THE TRUNCATION ERRORS USED IN FINITE DIFFERENCE METHODS CAN INTRODUCE ARTIFICIAL DISPERSION AND DISSIPATION

IF WE GO LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE THAT WE LIVE IN A SIMULATED UNIVERSE THEN I SUSPECT THAT WE WILL EVENTUALLY DISCOVER NEW UNEXPLAINED PHENOMENA THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH SOME TYPE OF NUMERICAL METHOD BUT WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD TO DISTINGUISH IF PHENOMENA IS AN ARTIFACT OF THE NUMERICAL METHOD OR SOME UNDISCOVERED PHYSICAL PROSPERITY OF THE UNIVERSE
DEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF THE SIMULATION AND THE ASSUMPTION YOU MAKE ABOUT REALITY

ONE COMMON ASSUMPTION ABOUT REALITY FOR EXAMPLE IS THAT IT IS ISOTROPIC MEANING IT WORKS THE SAME IN ALL DIRECTIONS A SIMULATION THAT WORKS ON A GRID HOWEVER WOULD NOT BE ISOTROPIC AND MOVING ALONG THE PRIMARY AXES WORKS DIFFERENTLY THEN GOING IN A DIAGONAL LINE

THE ISSUE WITH THAT HOWEVER IS THAT THOSE AND SIMILAR ANOMALIES COULD JUST BE HOW REALITY WORKS WE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT THE REAL REALITY WOULD BE LIKE FROM WITHIN A SIMULATION WE WOULD ONLY KNOW THE SIMULATION SO THIS WOULDN'T BE A PROOF BUT A GOOD INDICATION THAT THE UNIVERSE MIGHT BE A LITTLE MORE WEIRD THAN WE ASSUMED AND MAKE A SIMULATION MORE LIKELY

THE CLOSED THING TO A REAL PROOF WOULD PROBABLY BE FIGURING OUT EXPLOITS AND BUGS IN THE SIMULATION THAT LET YOU HAVE A LOOK AT THE UNDERLYING STRUCTURE OF THE SIMULATION ITSELF THE MOST DRAMATIC WOULD BE AN ARBITRARY CODE EXECUTION EXPLOIT SEE FOR EXAMPLE THIS ONE WHERE SOMEBODY IS WRITING A FLAPPY BIRDS CLONE BY PLAYING SUPER MARIO WORLD DOWNSIDE OF THAT IS HOWEVER THAT THE SIMULATION MIGHT CRASH IN THE PROCESS

NUMBER A SUFFICIENTLY ADVANCED SIMULATION CAN INTERFERE WITH YOUR PERCEPTION DIRECTLY AND INDIVIDUALLY ANY EXPERIMENTAL RESULT MUST IN THE END COME INTO YOUR BRAIN THROUGH YOUR EYES AND EARS AND IF THESE DO NOT OBJECTIVELY EXIST THEN ANY RESULT CAN BE SIMULATED

ROUND ONE SAYS NO TO SIMULATION HYPOTHESIS
NEWS

TO ME IT ALL SEEMS A LITTLE TOO WELL BUILT TOO LARGE TOO SELF RECYCLING LOOKS LIKE A GREAT SIMULATION TO ME MAKING THE CONNECTION TO OUR UNDERSTANDING AND LIMITATIONS OF COMPUTER SIMULATIONS IS A REACH IN MY OPINION
I'M A STUDENT OF HIS IN AMSTERDAM AND SOME PEOPLE FROM MY UNIVERSITY INCLUDING PEOPLE WHO WORKED WITH HIM ON THE PAPER WROTE A NICE POPSCI AND DUTCH ARTICLE ON HIS PUBLICATION

ONE OF THE CRITICISMS OF ENTROPIC GRAVITY IDEA WAS THAT IT ALREADY RULED OUT EXPERIMENTALLY BY GRAVITATIONALLY BOUND QUANTUM STATES OF COLD NEUTRONS I DON'T THINK THIS IS ADDRESSED IN THE NEW PAPER IS IT EVEN ABOUT THE SAME THEORY
ELI
EITHER WAY A VERY GOOD THEORY PROVEN WRONG IS STILL A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I HOPE TO SEE A UNIFIED THEORY IN MY LIFETIME
THE INTERWEBS ARE HYPING THIS HARD

PAPER ON ARXIV

BREI MINUTE VIDEO WITH VIRTUALLY NO INFORMATION IN IT
IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY THIS IS A STATIC SOLUTION I EAST IT EXPLAINS TODAYS UNIVERSE

SO NOT AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE YET
I DON'T MEAN TO BE CONDESCENDING BUT IS THERE A REASON WHY THIS PAPER IS GETTING SO MUCH MEDIA HYPE JUST A FEW HOURS AFTER UPLOADING
LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS ESPECIALLY IF HE ADDRESSES THE EXPERIMENTS THAT SEEMINGLY DISPROVED THE PAPER I'VE ALWAYS HOPED THAT THE THEORIES OF DARK MATTER WOULD PROVE TO BE INCORRECT
I'LL SAY THE SAME THING I SAID ON THE EVERYTHING SCIENCE THREAD THIS IS INTERESTING BUT NOT

THE REASON THAT DARK MATTER IS THE MOST POPULAR MODEL IS BECAUSE THE MODIFICATIONS OF GRAVITY WE HAVE ARE ALL UNSATISFACTORY IN SOME WAY THEY USUALLY FALL INTO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES

THE THEORY IS NOT EXTENDABLE TO RELATIVISTIC SITUATIONS EAST G MOND

2 THE THEORY DOES NOT MATCH ALL OBSERVATIONS EAST G NAIVE F R GRAVITY MASSIVE GRAVITY

WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO SHOW THE THEORY CAN BE FORMULATED AS A WELL-POSED INITIAL VALUE PROBLEM MEANING ONE CANNOT USE IT TO TAKE INFORMATION AND MAKE A PREDICTION ABOUT THE FUTURE EAST G HIGHER CURVATURE GRAVITY OR MASSIVE GRAVITY

IT HAS A PROFOUNDLY UNCOMFORTABLE IMPLICATIONS SUCH AS A LOSS OF CAUSALITY OR IF COVARIANCE EAST G ETHER THEORY OR EINSTEIN AETHER THEORY

I SHOULD ALSO ADD THAT MANY THEORIES OF MODIFIED GRAVITY ARE MOTIVATED BY A DESIRE TO UNDERSTAND QUANTUM GRAVITY SO THIS IS NOT THE FIRST FROM PRINCIPLES APPROACH AND AS THE ARTICLE STATES THIS IS ONE REASON TO STUDY MODIFICATIONS OF GRAVITY

BUT FOR THOSE OF US IN THE COMMUNITY THERE ARE IS A VERITABLE ZOO OF MODELS AN EXTRA ONE IS INTERESTING BUT NOT NECESSARILY CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION
LEE SMOLIN RECENTLY PUBLISHED A SIMILAR PAPER FOUR PRINCIPLES OF QUANTUM GRAVITY WHICH NOTED THAT MOND CAN BE CONSTRUCTED FROM QUANTUM GRAVITY MOND DOESN'T EXPLAIN A LOT OF THINGS BEYOND GALAXY ROTATION CURVES AS FAR AS I KNOW BUT IT'S INTERESTING AT LEAST
MANY COMMENTS HAVE MENTIONED THE BULLET CLUSTER CAN SOMEONE POST A SHORT SUMMARY OF IT'S SIGNIFICANCE
THE LAST SECTION OF THE PAPER FOR THOSE INTERESTED

EMERGENT GRAVITY AND APPARENT DARK MATTER IN COSMOLOGICAL SCENARIOS
IN THIS PAPER WE HAVE FOCUSSED ON THE EXPLANATION OF THE OBSERVED GRAVITATIONAL PHENOMENA
ATTRIBUTED TO DARK MATTER BY THIS WE MEAN THE EXCESS IN THE GRAVITATIONAL
FORCE OR THE MISSING MASS THAT IS OBSERVED IN SPIRAL OR ELLIPTICAL GALAXIES AND IN GALAXY
CLUSTERS OF COURSE DARK MATTER PLAYS A CENTRAL ROLE IN MANY OTHER ASPECTS OF THE CURRENT
COSMOLOGICAL PARADIGM IN PARTICULAR IN STRUCTURE FORMATION AND THE EXPLANATION

OF THE ACOUSTIC PEAKS IN THE COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND IN NONE OF THESE SCENARIOS
IS IT REQUIRED THAT DARK MATTER IS A PARTICLE ALL THAT IS NEEDED IS THAT ITS COSMOLOGICAL
EVOLUTION AND DYNAMICS IS CONSISTENT WITH A PRESSURELESS FLUID IN OUR DESCRIPTION
WE EVENTUALLY END UP WITH AN ESTIMATE OF THE APPARENT DARK MATTER DENSITY THAT IN
MANY RESPECTS BEHAVES AS REQUIRED FOR STRUCTURE FORMATION AND PERHAPS EVEN FOR THE
EXPLANATION OF THE CB SPECTRUM NAMELY EFFECTIVELY THE APPARENT DARK MATTER THAT
COMES OUT OF OUR EMERGENT GRAVITY DESCRIPTION ALSO LEADS TO A GRAVITATIONAL POTENTIAL
THAT ATTRACTS THE BARYONIC MATTER AS COLD DARK MATTER WOULD DO
HOWEVER THE ARGUMENTS AND CALCULATIONS THAT WE PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER ARE NOT YET
SUFFICIENT TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS REGARDING THE COSMOLOGICAL EVOLUTION OF OUR EQUATIONS
IN PARTICULAR WE MADE USE OF THE VALUE OF THE PRESENT-DAY HUBBLE PARAMETER IN
OUR EQUATIONS WHICH IMMEDIATELY RAISES THE QUESTION WHETHER ONE SHOULD USE ANOTHER
VALUE FOR THE HUBBLE PARAMETER AT OTHER COSMOLOGICAL TIMES IN OUR CALCULATIONS THE
PARAMETER WAS ASSUMED TO BE CONSTANT SINCE WE MADE THE APPROXIMATION THAT OUR
UNIVERSE IS ENTIRELY DOMINATED BY DARK ENERGY AND THAT ORDINARY MATTER ONLY LEADS TO
A SMALL PERTURBATION THIS SUGGESTS THAT OR RATHER SHOULD ACTUALLY BE DEFINED
IN TERMS OF THE DARK ENERGY DENSITY OR THE VALUE OF THE COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT THIS
WOULD IMPLY THAT IS INDEED CONSTANT EVEN THOUGH IT TAKES A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT VALUE
A RELATED ISSUE IS THAT IN OUR ANALYSIS WE ASSUMED THAT DARK ENERGY IS THE DOMINANT
CONTRIBUTION TO THE ENERGY DENSITY OF OUR UNIVERSE ACCORDING TO OUR STANDARD COSMOLOGICAL
SCENARIOS THIS IS NO LONGER TRUE IN THE EARLY TIMES OF OUR UNIVERSE IN PARTICULAR
AT THE TIME OF DECOUPLING THIS POSES AGAIN THE QUESTION WHETHER A THEORY IN WHICH
APPARENT DARK MATTER IS EXPLAINED VIA EMERGENT GRAVITY WOULD BE ABLE TO REPRODUCE
THE SUCCESSFUL DESCRIPTION OF THE CB SPECTRUM THE LARGE SCALE STRUCTURE AND GALAXY
FORMATION THESE QUESTIONS NEED TO BE UNDERSTOOD BEFORE WE CAN MAKE ANY CLAIM THAT
OUR DESCRIPTION OF DARK MATTER PHENOMENA IS AS SUCCESSFUL AS THE OCDM PARADIGM IN
DESCRIBING THE EARLY UNIVERSE AND COSMOLOGY AT LARGE SCALES
BY CHANGING THE WAY WE VIEW GRAVITY NAMELY AS AN EMERGENT PHENOMENON IN WHICH
THE EINSTEIN EQUATIONS NEED BE DERIVED FROM THE THERMODYNAMICS OF QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT
ONE ALSO HAS TO CHANGE THE WAY WE VIEW THE EVOLUTION OF THE UNIVERSE IN
PARTICULAR ONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DERIVE THE COSMOLOGICAL EVOLUTION EQUATIONS FROM
EMERGENT GRAVITY FOR THIS ONE NEEDS TO FIRST PROPERLY UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF QUANTUM
ENTANGLEMENT AND THE EVOLUTION OF THE TOTAL ENTROPY OF OUR UNIVERSE SO IT IS STILL AN
OPEN QUESTION IF AND HOW THE STANDARD COSMOLOGICAL PICTURE IS INCORPORATED IN A THEORY
OF EMERGENT GRAVITY HOW DOES ONE INTERPRET THE EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE FROM THIS
PERSPECTIVE OR DOES INFLATION STILL PLAY A ROLE IN AN EMERGENT COSMOLOGICAL SCENARIO
ALL THESE QUESTIONS ARE BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE PRESENT PAPER SO WE WILL NOT MAKE
AN ATTEMPT TO ANSWER ALL OR EVEN A PART OF THESE QUESTIONS THIS ALSO MEANS THAT BEFORE
THESE QUESTIONS ARE INVESTIGATED IT IS TOO EARLY TO MAKE A JUDGEMENT ON WHETHER OUR
EMERGENT GRAVITY DESCRIPTION OF DARK MATTER WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO REPLACE THE CURRENT
PARTICLE DARK MATTER PARADIGM IN EARLY COSMOLOGICAL SCENARIOS

THE PAPER APPEARS TO BE A VERY LONG ARGUMENT ABOUT HOW THE ENTANGLEMENT ENTROPY OF SPACE IS DISPLACED EVACUATED BY MATTER AND THIS EVACUATION CAUSE SOME KIND OF ELASTIC STRAIN IN THE ENTROPY FIELD SOME KIND OF ARGUMENTS ABOUT BEDSITTER SPACES THIS STRAIN THEN ACTS LIKE A SURFACE DENSITY ABOUT THE ORIGINAL MASS EQ REFERRED TO AS BEING LIKE A DARK MATTER DENSITY WHICH WHEN INTEGRATED GIVES A THE USUAL DARK MATTER FORCE

I SUSPECT THIS IS A VERY LONG ARGUMENT ABOUT HOW TO DERIVE AN ADDITIONAL K R POTENTIAL AROUND NORMAL NEWTONIAN MATTER
A NEW SEAN CARROLL ARTICLE WITH AN EMBEDDED MINUTE VIDEO IN WHICH HE TALKS SOME ABOUT NEW EMERGENT GRAVITY PAPER ENTROPIC GRAVITY SEAN CURRENTLY WORKS ON THAT THE CB ANALYSIS OF ACOUSTIC OSCILLATIONS MOND THE PAPER BY SARKAR ET AL ON TYPE SUPERNOVAE AND AN HOMAGE TO THE XKCD CARTOON ABOUT YES ALREADY THOUGHT OF THAT ALL IN THE CONTEXT OF SUPPORTING DE AND DM BASED ON A DIVERSITY OF OBSERVATIONAL EVIDENCE


GOOD LUCK BUDDY
AT THE RISK OF SOUNDING LIKE AN IDIOT HAVEN'T WE ALREADY OBSERVED THE EFFECTS OF DARK MATTER VIA GRAVITATIONAL LENSING
I DIDN'T READ THE ARTICLE BUT ISN'T THE BULLET CLUSTER ONE OF THE BITS OF EVIDENCE THAT FORCES A DARK MATTER PARTICLE IN OUR GRAVITATION THEORIES
SO ANOTHER TOP SCIENTIST CLAIMING NEWTON AND EINSTEIN WERE WRONG PFAFF NOT AGAIN
I'M EXCITED TO MAYBE USE THIS
THIS IS THE BEST TL R I COULD MAKE ORIGINAL REDUCED BY I'M A BOT

THE MEASUREMENT OF THE ANALOGOUS EFFECT IN A SONIC BLACK HOLE IN THIS CASE QUANTUM UNITS OF SOUND RADIATING OUTWARD FROM A SONIC HORIZON THEREFORE BRINGS A LONG-STANDING QUESTION TO A HEAD ARE SONIC BLACK HOLES TRUE ANALOGUES OF BLACK HOLES MORE SPECIFICALLY DO FINDINGS INDIRECTLY VALIDATE CALCULATION PROVING THAT INFORMATION IS LOST IN BLACK HOLES

IF APPROXIMATION IS WRONG THEN SONIC BLACK HOLES ARE NOT GOOD PROXIES FOR BLACK HOLES AND QUANTUM GRAVITY MIGHT SOMEHOW ENCODE BLACK HOLE HISTORIES IN THEIR RADIATION PRESERVING INFORMATION AS BLACK HOLES EVAPORATE

FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE AN ANALOGUE TO HAWKING RADIATION IN SONIC BLACK HOLES SAYS NOTHING ABOUT TRUE BLACK HOLES BECAUSE THE TWO ARE CATEGORICALLY DIFFERENT WHEREAS THE FLUID APPROXIMATION IS ACCURATE IN THE CASE OF SONIC BLACK HOLES SPACE-TIME MUST NOT BE APPROXIMATELY SMOOTH AT BLACK HOLE EVENT HORIZONS



EXTENDED SUMMARY FAQ VERSION TL RS SO FAR THEORY FEEDBACK AND COMMENTS ARE MONITORED CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK IS WELCOME TOP KEYWORDS BLACK HOLE 2 HAWKING SONIC QUANTUM
BEYOND THE FACT THAT IT HAS AN EXTREMELY SCIENCE SOUNDING TITLE IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD ABOUT THE PAPER WHY YOU FIND IT INTERESTING WHAT IT ADDS TO THE CURRENT STATE OF THE FIELD ETC
THE THEORIES OF A SPACETIME AND CONSTANTLY EXPANDING UNIVERSE MAY SEEM BUT THERE'S A PRETTY GOOD VISUALIZATION THAT EXPLAINS IT IMAGINE TAKING AN UNBLOWN BALLOON AND DRAWING TWO DOTS REPRESENTATION GALAXIES RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER THEN BLOWING THE BALLOON UP AS THE BALLOON EXPANDS AND STRETCHES THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO DOTS INCREASES AS THEY ARE STRETCHED AWAY FROM EACH OTHER

THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS WHEN THEY SAY THE UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING BUT ISN'T EXPANDING INTO ANYTHING
I MADE A POST IN R ASKPHYSICS JUST A BIT AGO BUT I'M GONNA PASTE IT HERE IF THAT'S OKAY HERE IS THE THREAD

I'M WORKING ON A PROJECT THAT REQUIRES APPLYING A V M ELECTRIC FIELD THROUGH SOME CELLS SUSPENDED IN MEDIA THE PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT IS TO SEE THE EFFECTS THE FIELD HAS ON THE CELLS WHEN A FIELD IS APPLIED BUT A CURRENT ISN'T NO CURRENT CAN PASS THROUGH THE MEDIA

IN ORDER TO DO THIS THE PROPOSED SET-UP WAS TO HAVE TO ALUMINUM FOIL PLATES ON EITHER SIDE OF A PETRI DISH CONTAINING CELLS IN CELL MEDIA AND THEN CONNECTING THOSE PLATES TO A POWER SUPPLY THE POWER SUPPLY WOULD BE TURNED ON AND A VOLTAGE WOULD BE APPLIED ACROSS THE PLATES SUCH THAT THE CELLS EXPERIENCE A TARGET FIELD STRENGTH
I HAD SPOKEN TO SOME TECHNICIANS AT A COMPANY WHICH SPECIALIZES IN MEASURING ELECTRIC FIELDS INCLUDING THE COMPANY'S OWNER AND THEY HAD TOLD ME THAT THE PROJECT WAS NOT POSSIBLE BY APPLYING THE FIELD THE CHARGE IN THE MEDIA WOULD POLARIZE SUCH THAT THE NET FIELD EXPERIENCED BY THE CELLS WOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO IS THIS TRUE IS IT POSSIBLE TO APPLY A FIELD TO THE CELLS WITHOUT PASSING A CURRENT THROUGH THEM

HERE IS A DIAGRAM OF THE SET-UP HETP

WE ARE CURRENTLY USING A DC POWER SUPPLY HOWEVER WE COULD SWITCH TO AC IF THAT MAKES ANY DIFFERENCE BUT THE GOAL IS TO HAVE THE CELLS EXPERIENCING A MV MM FIELD IN ONE CONSISTENT DIRECTION
HI I'M A PHYSICS MAJOR IN THE THIRD YEAR OF MY UNDERGRADUATE I'M LOOKING AT FINISHING MY SENIOR YEAR AND LIKELY PURSUING MY MASTERS DEGREE IN NEW ZEALAND AND I WAS WONDERING IF ANYONE HAD ANY ADVICE ABOUT PHYSICS PROGRAMS AT UNIVERSITIES IN NZ I'M INTERESTED IN RESEARCH SPECIFICALLY BIOPHYSICS
CAN ANYONE HERE GIVE ME AN EXPLANATION OF CROSS AND DOT PRODUCTS THAT DIFFERS FROM CLASSIC TEXTBOOK DEFINITIONS I'M NOT ASKING SOMEONE TO REINVENT THE WHEEL RATHER I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT IF SOMEONE HERE CAN OFFER ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE REGARDING THE TOPIC
I RECENTLY STUMBLED ACROSS A THEORY CALLED DISPERSIVE EXTINCTION THEORY PROPOSED BY A GUY WHO IS A TENURED PROFESSOR IN TENNESSEE WHO ARGUES AGAINST GENERAL RELATIVITY ARGUES THAT SPACETIME IS FLAT ARGUES AGAINST THE BIG BANG AND ARGUES THAT THE REDSHIFT THAT WE OBSERVE IS DUE TO LIGHT DISPERSING THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF SPACE RATHER THAN BECAUSE SPACETIME IS EXPANDING

HERE'S THE PAPER

DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY DIRECT RESPONSE OR REBUTTAL TO THIS OTHER THAN IT'S A FRINGE THEORY IT'S EXTREMELY OBSCURE OR YOU MIGHT AS WELL BELIEVE THE EARTH IS FLAT
HI I AM TRYING TO GET INTO QUANTUM INFORMATION THEORY ANY SUGGESTION FOR THETEXTBOOK ARTICLES TO START FOR THE
I MADE A POST IN R ASKPHYSICS A WHILE AGO AND COULD NOT GET AN ANSWER I MIGHT JUST BE DUMB BUT HERE IT IS
R ASKPHYSICS COMMENTS

THE CONTENTS

FOR THE RECORD I HAVE LITTLE EXPERIENCE WITH PHYSICS I AM PRETTY GOOD WITH MATHEMATICS
I HAVE A PIPE INSIDE OF WICH THERE IS A CONSTANT AMOUNT PRESSURE SUPPLIED FROM ONE END LIKE A COMPRESSOR ON THE OTHER THE GAS AIR IS FREE TO LEAVE AND EXPERIENCES DECOMPRESSION
KNOWING THE TEMPERATURE OF THE GAS INSIDE THE PIPE AS WELL AS THE TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE ATMOSPHERE WHEN IT LEAVES HOW WOULD ONE GO ABOUT CALCULATING THE INITIAL PRESSURE WOULD THIS APPLY TO LIQUID WATER AS WELL
I AM TRYING TO COOL WATER AND AIR SEPARATELY TO
I TRIED USING LAW BUT THAT ASSUMES CONSTANT VOLUME AND PRESSURE AND VOLUME USING IT I WAS ABLE TO CALCULATE THAT A SIMPLE PRESSURE WASHER CAN COOL TO ALMOST ABSOLUTE ZERO WICH IS WRONG
IF YOU COULD BE A LOT MORE SPECIFIC IN THE ANSWER INSTEAD OF LOOK HERE THAT WOULD BE NICE

EDIT

HERE IS WHAT THE SETUP LOOKS LIKE
IT'S MORE LIKE A MATHEMATICAL QUESTION BUT WHAT ARE POSSIBLE METHODS TO NUMERICALLY SOLVE AN ODE WHERE Y Y T IS CONTINUOUS BUT THE SOLUTION Y T WILL AND MUST BE DISCONTINUOUS IN A SINGLE POINT
SO I HAVE TO WRITE A BASIC SIMULATION FOR A RACECARD GOING ALONG A TRACK AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW I COULD WRITE A FUNCTION R T THAT GIVES ME THE POSITION VECTOR OF THE CAR AT ANY TIME TENSE I HAVE THE CAR'S INITIAL VELOCITY IT'S TANGENTIAL ACCELERATION AND THE RADIUS OF THE CIRCULAR TRACK I'VE LOOKED UP PLENTY OF RESOURCES ABOUT CIRCULAR MOTION BUT NONE SEEM TO EXPLICITLY GIVE THE PARAMETRIC EQUATIONS I NEED SORRY IF THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT PLACE FOR THIS SORT OF QUESTION BUT I'VE BEEN GOOGLING AROUND FOR A WHILE NOW AND THE BEST THING I'VE FOUND IS THIS WHICH ISN'T VERY HELPFUL
IF SOMEONE WHO WAS PLANNING ON APPLYING TO GRAD SCHOOL THIS SEMESTER RANDOMLY DECIDED TO FOCUS MAINLY ON CANADIAN SCHOOLS WHAT ADVICE WOULD SPRING TO YOUR MIND
WHY NOT BOTH OR MAJOR IN PHYSICS AND MINOR IN MATH I HAD FRIENDS DO THAT MANY PHYSICS PROGRAMS ALLOW FOR MATH CLASSES TO BE ELECTIVES THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO GET SOME OF BOTH
I'M DOING BOTH
DO YOU LIKE LAB WORK AT ALL
DELETED
MATHEMATICS AT LEAST IF YOU ARE IN USA I DID RESEARCH ON THIS EXACT QUESTION WEEK AGO AFTER MA YOU CAN DO PHD IN PHYSICS STILL
THERE'S A LOT OF OVERLAP BETWEEN THE TWO AND TYPICALLY MATH COURSES COUNT AS ELECTIVES FOR PHYSICS AND VICE VERSA DO BOTH
TO EVERYONE MENTIONING THE DOUBLE MAJOR IM A LITTLE LATE IN GETTING MY FIRST BACHELORS DEGREE SO I WANT TO FINISH IT SOON AND NOT DELAY IT THANKS FOR THE SUGGESTIONS THO
IF YOU'RE SET ON PHYSICS I WOULD DO A MATH MINOR IT'S USUALLY JUST A FEW EXTRA CLASSES
WHY DO YOU MUST CHOOSE ONE THEORETICAL PHYSICS IS REAL MATH
ARE YOU CURIOUS ABOUT OTHER SCIENCES

DO YOU ENJOY NUMERICAL METHODS ETC
POR QUE NO LOS DOS
SAW A QUOTE THAT WENT FIELDS RATHER THAN PARTICLES MAY BE FUNDAMENTAL SORRY CAN'T REMEMBER WHERE I SAW IT OR WHO SAID IT ANYWAY WOULD THIS IDEA BE RELEVANT HERE
THE KIND OF PHENOMENA YOU DESCRIBE PARTICLE CREATION DESTRUCTION IN THE SM ARE RELEVANT TO RELATIVISTIC QUANTUM FIELD THEORY BOEHMIAN MECHANICS DOESN'T EXTEND NEARLY AS FAR AS OF TODAY MAYBE BECAUSE NOONE MANAGED TO YET OR BECAUSE IT CANNOT BE DONE
DO NOT CONFUSE THE BOEHMIAN PARTICLES AS BEING SOMEHOW EQUIVALENT TO THE FUNDAMENTAL PARTICLES PEOPLE TALK ABOUT IN QUANTUM FIELD THEORY THEY ARE NOT THE SAME

NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO PRESENT A TERRIBLY SATISFACTORY RELATIVISTIC VERSION OF A BOEHMIAN FIELD THEORY YET IF THEY DID HOWEVER THE THINGS WE THINK OF NOW AS FUNDAMENTAL PARTICLES WOULD BE EXPLAINED IN THAT THEORY AS SOME KIND OF EMERGENT PROPERTY OF QUANTUM FIELDS WHICH IS TO SAY CONCEPTUALLY NOTHING WOULD CHANGE ON THIS FRONT THE ELECTRON AND THE QUARK AND THE PHOTON AND ALL THE OTHERS WOULD EACH BE SOME SPECIAL SET OF CONFIGURATIONS OF BOEHMIAN PARTICLES THAT REMAIN COHERENT OVER LONG TIME SCALES DECAYS LIKE THAT OF THE NEUTRON WOULD THEN CORRESPOND TO SUCH CONFIGURATIONS CHANGING FROM ONE TO ANOTHER THE IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT THE BOEHMIAN PARTICLES DO NOT CARRY THEIR QUANTUM NUMBERS WITH THEM THINGS LIKE ANGULAR MOMENTUM COLOR CHARGE ETC ARE PROPERTIES OF THE WAVEFUNCTION SO THE SAME BOEHMIAN PARTICLES THAT COMPRISE THE UP QUARK CAN ALSO COMPRISE THE DOWN QUARK PROVIDED THAT THE WAVEFUNCTION IS ARRANGED IN THE APPROPRIATE WAY

I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY REASON IN THE THEORY FOR THE BOEHMIAN PARTICLES TO NEED TO BE CREATED OR DESTROYED
BOHM ISN'T SAYING ITS PARTICLES HAVE TO EXIST FOREVER JUST THAT WHILE THEY EXIST THEY ALWAYS HAVE DEFINITE POSITIONS

REDDIN IS REALLY ON BOHM KICK SINCE THAT YOUTUBE VIDEO LAST WEEK
THE WIKI ARTICLE ON THE DE THEORY ACTUALLY DOES A REALLY GOOD JOB OF EXPLAINING IT IMHO

PARTICLES COME AND GO AS THEY DO AS DESCRIBED BY QUANTUM THEORY NO ISSUES THERE

SO AT EVERY MOMENT OF TIME THERE EXISTS NOT ONLY A WAVE FUNCTION BUT ALSO A WELL-DEFINED CONFIGURATION Q OF THE WHOLE UNIVERSE I EAST THE SYSTEM AS DEFINED BY THE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS USED IN SOLVING THE SCHRDINGER EQUATION

THE GREATEST DEPARTURE FROM CLASSICAL MECHANICS IS THE NOTION THAT PHYSICAL PROPERTIES EAST G MASS CHARGE ARE SPREAD OUT OVER THE WAVEFUNCTION IN DE THEORY NOT LOCALIZED AT THE POSITION OF THE PARTICLE

KEEP IN MIND THAT COPENHAGEN AND BOHM BOTH AGREE ON OBSERVATION BUT DISAGREE ON HOW TO INTERPRET WHAT IS OBSERVED IT'S NOT A THEORY THAT POSTULATES A COMPETITIVE ALTERNATIVE TO THE STANDARD MODEL BUT RATHER AN ALTERNATIVE WAY OF UNDERSTANDING LOOKING AT THE SM
COPYING AND EXPANDING ON WHAT I WROTE BELOW

FIRST OF ALL YOU NEED TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY DO YOU WANT A BOEHMIAN QUANTUM FIELD THEORY OR ARE YOU TRYING TO MAKE ONTOLOGICAL SENSE OUT OF THE CURRENT AFT

FOR THE FIRST OPTION THE REASON FOR THE NONEXISTENCE OF A BOEHMIAN AFT IS THAT NOONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO COME UP WITH A SATISFACTORY RELATIVISTIC QUANTUM MECHANICS YET AFT IS INHERENTLY PROBLEMATIC FOR TWO REASONS

IT ONLY MAKES PREDICTIONS IN THE SCATTERING REGIME WHERE STILL EACH NONTRIVIAL TERM IS DIVERGENT AND THE LIMIT OF THE PERTURBATION SERIES IS DUBIOUS

2 IT BREAKS RELATIVISTIC INVARIANCE BY INVOKING A HAMILTONIAN DESCRIPTION WHICH FORCES YOU TO CHOOSE AN HYPERSURFACE ON WHICH YOU DO PHYSICS

THESE PROBLEMS COULD NOT BE SOLVED BY NOW AS SOON AS A SATISFACTORY RELATIVISTIC QM EXISTS IT WILL BE PLAY TO MAKE IT BOEHMIAN THIS IS DONE FOR ALL KINDS OF MODELS ALL THE TIME


FOR THE SECOND OPTION EVEN IN CURRENT AFT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO GIVE A DYNAMIC DESCRIPTION OF THESE ANNIHILATION OR CREATION PROCESSES WHICH SUPERSEDES THOSE FROM DIRAC THEORY THERE ANNIHILATION AND CREATION ARE UNDERSTOOD USING FOR INSTANCE THE DIRAC SEA DESCRIPTION AND CAN BE MADE BOEHMIAN
I JUST FOUND THIS BROWSING A YEAR OLD THREAD ON THIS TOPIC AFT AS THEORY OF PARTICLE CREATION AND DESTRUCTION IT SEEMED RELEVANT SO I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A LOOK THOUGH MIND ME I HAVEN'T READ THE PAPER ONLY THE ABSTRACT AND I'M NOT A PHYSICIST YET SO I DON'T WHETHER IT WILL BE OF ANY HELP
IT'S REGARDED AS UNLIKELY BUT POSSIBLE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR BOTH SPATIAL AND PRESENT TEMPORAL CHANGE IN THE FINE STRUCTURE CONSTANT BUT IT'S NOT SUPER HIGH UP ON PRIORITY LIST SO THERE'S NOT A LOT OF DATA SO FAR
NOW A SECOND LUX HAS BEEN FOUND WHOSE X-RAY EMISSION BEING COHERENTLY PULSED CAN ORIGINATE ONLY FROM A NEUTRON STAR THAT'S BECAUSE THE ALL-IMPORTANT SEPARATION BETWEEN A ROTATION AXIS AND ITS MAGNETIC POLES REQUIRES A SURFACE WHICH BLACK HOLES LACK

THIS IS A COMPLETE MISAPPLICATION OF THE KERR NEWMAN METRIC REGARDLESS OF THE BLACK HOLE ITSELF REQUIRING ALIGNMENT THE BLACK HOLE NEVERTHELESS DOES HAVE A PRACTICAL SURFACE WHICH WOULD BE THE INFALL OF MATERIAL JUST AROUND THE EVENT HORIZON AND NOTHING PREVENTS THIS MATERIAL FROM CREATING MAGNETIC FIELDS THAT ARE NOT ALIGNED WITH THE ROTATION OF THE BLACK HOLE ITSELF INDEED BLACK HOLES THEMSELVES ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE AN IMPORTANT NET ELECTRIC CHARGE SO ANY MAGNETIC FIELDS YOU SEE GENERATED AROUND A BLACK HOLE ARE MOST LIKELY NOT BY THE BLACK HOLE

IT S NOT MUCH OF A SECRET THAT I M A FAN OF HIDDEN VARIABLES AKA SUPERDETERMINISM WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE EXPERIMENTALLY TESTABLE

HOW WHAT EXPERIMENT COULD BE DONE
AS EVER THE FANATICAL TO THIS IS FOUND IN BUBOS BLOG
I DON T THINK FOR EXAMPLE THAT NUMEROLOGICAL COINCIDENCES ARE PROBLEMS WORTH THINKING ABOUT THEY RE QUESTIONS OF AESTHETIC APPEAL THE MASS OF THE HIGGS IS MUCH SMALLER THAN THE PLANCK MASSACHUSETTS SO WHAT THE SPATIAL CURVATURE OF THE UNIVERSE IS ALMOST ZERO THE COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT TINY AND THE ELECTRIC DIPOLE MOMENT OF THE NEUTRON IS FOR ALL WE KNOW ABSENT WHY SHOULD THAT BOTHER ME IF YOU THINK THAT S A MATHEMATICAL INCONSISTENCY THINK AGAIN IT S NOT THERE S NO LOGICAL REASON FOR WHY THAT SHOULDN T BE SO IT S JUST THAT TO OUR HUMAN SENSE IT DOESN T QUITE FEEL RIGHT

MAYBE I'M MISUNDERSTANDING BUT THIS STRIKES ME AS A PARTICULARLY SILLY THING TO SAY MATHEMATICAL COINCIDENCES ARE A PRETTY IMPORTANT WAY TO MAKE DISCOVERIES OR TO CONFIRM OR DISPROVE THEORIES THE UNIVERSE HAVING NO MEASURABLE CURVATURE SUGGESTS THAT IT EITHER MUST BE FLAT OR THERE IS A MECHANISM THAT STRONGLY FLATTENS IT BELOW OUR MEASURING PRECISION THIS IS A POINT IN FAVOUR OF THE INFLATION MODEL I MEAN IF YOU'RE GOING THERE YOU COULD START SAYING THINGS LIKE THAT MAXWELL CALCULATING THAT AN ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE SHOULD MOVE AT ABOUT THE SPEED OF LIGHT IS JUST A COINCIDENCE
NOT TOTALLY PERTINENT BUT WEINBERG CAN ALSO BE A TOTAL ASSHOLE I HAD HIS CLASS BACK IN UNDERGRAD HE STRAIGHT UP MADE A GIRL CRY
INTERPRETATION OF QM SEEMS LACKING TO ME TOO

IF YOU SEE AS COLLAPSE OF WAVE FUNCTION WHEN AS A PROBLEM THAT SEEMS TO SUGGEST EXPERIMENTS THAT TRY TO CHALLENGE WHEN THIS COLLAPSE IS SUPPOSED TO TAKE PLACE

I THINK DEAN GRADINS APPROACH IS MISGUIDED IN TRYING TO INVOLVE HUMANS INTO IT BUT I EAST THIS EXPERIMENT A PDF DOES TRY CHALLENGE IT SEEING IF THE HUMAN BECOMES PART OF THE EXPERIMENT IF ONLY SLIGHTLY

USING HUMANS IS SILLY CAN WONDER IF AN ELECTRONIC CIRCUIT COMPUTER OR WHATEVER CAN BECOME SLIGHTLY PART OF THE WAVEFUNCTION BEING COLLAPSED THEN YOUR SAMPLE SIZE CAN BE MADE LARGER MUCH EASIER AND YOU CAN TRY IF TEMPERATURE MATTERS IF IT DOES ANYTHING I'D SOONER EXPECT IT AT LOWER TEMPERATURES CAN ALSO TRY REINFORCEMENT LEARNING OF COURSE IT WOULD APPEAR LIKE THE OUTPUTS DON'T DO ANYTHING BUT THE IDEA IS THAT THEY'RE EVER SO SLIGHTLY ENTANGLED WITH ASPECTS OF THE EXPERIMENT AND THAT IT'D LEARN WAYS TO TRY MAKE IT ENTANGLED AND MOVE THE RESULT

AS I HAVE STATED BEFORE MY MONEY RIGHT NOW IS ON COLLAPSE THAT DEFINED THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE AND SOMEHOW IMPLIES LOCAL WAVEFUNCTION COLLAPSE APPROXIMATELY TADA
IT'S INTERESTING THAT HE IS NOT A BIG FAN OF THE DECOHERENCE HISTORIES INTERPRETATION I HAD THE IMPRESSION THAT THAT WAS THE CUTTING EDGE NOWADAYS
DELETED
IT ONLY TAKES ABOUT LITTLE TWEAKS TO FIX QM GOT TO START WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL FIRST GRAVITY THEN MOVE UP TO QM THAT IS THE MISTAKE MOST PEOPLE MAKE
NO CLUE ONLY THING I'VE EVER BEEN ABLE TO FIND ARE LISTS OF PIEZOELECTRIC MATERIALS FROM STRONGEST TO WEAKEST OBSERVED INTERACTION AND THEY'RE NOT VERY EXTENSIVE
WHAT'S A DDP SORRY GOOGLE REVEALED NOTHING
THAT'S A FALSE TAKE ON SOME WORK WITH SURFACE PLASMONICS TOTAL BULLSHIT TITLE DID YOU EVEN READ IT
CAN WE NOT PLEASE I DON'T EVEN IT'S NOT EVEN WRONG
GROUND GLASS

NOT REALLY OPAQUE THEN WAS IT
MY QUESTION IS HOW DO WE KNOW THAT SOMETHING IS RANDOM UNDETERMINED WITHOUT MEASURING IT

FIRST I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT I THINK YOU DID A NICE JOB IN CLEARLY PHRASING THE DETAILS OF YOUR QUESTION ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT YOU ARE A NEWBIE AT QUANTUM PHYSICS

I SUGGEST SEVERAL READINGS THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL FIRST HERE IS A JOURNAL ARTICLE TITLED RANDOMNESS IN QUANTUM PHYSICS THAT COVERS A LOT OF THE ISSUES CONCEPTUALLY WITHOUT GETTING INTO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE UNDERLYING MATHEMATICS IT'S AN ACCESSIBLE READ THAT MAY BE A BIT OF A STRETCH BUT IF YOU READ IT CAREFULLY I THINK IT'LL ANSWER A LOT OF YOUR QUESTIONS

ANOTHER ARTICLE IS BY STEPHEN HAWKING TITLED DOES GOD PLAY DICE HETP

FINALLY I ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO SOME BACKGROUND AND SUPPLEMENTAL READING BRANCHING OUT INTO SOME RELATED TOPICS IN OTHER WORLDS HOMEWORK

DO YOU HAVE A BACKGROUND IN CLASSICAL PHYSICS IF NOT I SUGGEST YOU READ UP ON THE DETERMINISTIC WORLD-VIEW THAT WAS THE PRELUDE TO MODERN PHYSICS FOR EXAMPLE START WITH SCIENTIFIC DETERMINISM AND DEMON

AFTER DIGESTING STUFF LIKE THE ABOVE IF YOU WANT MORE NOTE THAT A LOT OF HISTORICAL BACKGROUND IS COVERED IN THIS ARTICLE AND IN ADDITION COMMENTS ON THE FACT THAT WHILE THE STANDARD COPENHAGEN INTERPRETATION OF QUANTUM MECHANICS IS AND CALCULATES THE PROBABILITIES OF OBSERVATIONAL OUTCOMES FROM THE WAVE FUNCTION AND THE BORN RULE THERE DO EXIST ALTERNATE INTERPRETATIONS OF QM THAT ARE DETERMINISTIC INCLUDING THE INTERPRETATION A POINT IS THAT AFTER AROUND YEARS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS HISTORY THERE IS STILL A LOT OF DIVERSITY AMONG PHYSICISTS AND PHILOSOPHERS ON THE INTERPRETATIONS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS NOTE HOWEVER THAT DESPITE THESE INTERPRETATIONAL DIFFERENCES IT HAS BEEN SUPREMELY SUCCESSFUL IN CALCULATING VERIFIABLE RESULTS

THE WIKIPEDIA QM ARTICLE FROM THE HISTORY SECTION THROUGH THE APPLICATIONS SECTION MIGHT BE OF INTEREST ALSO IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY READ IT

THIS IS INTERESTING WOULD LIKE TO HEAR AN ANSWER TO QUESTION
YOU MIGHT GET BETTER RESULTS ASKING IN R ASKPHYSICS

THE TYPICAL EXAMPLE TO USE IS A EXPERIMENT WHICH I'LL FIRST EXPLAIN IN CLASSICAL TERMS ON A MACROSCOPIC SCALE IMAGINE WE'RE IN A SQUARE ROOM WITH A WALL IN THE MIDDLE THAT WALL IS A SOLID BARRIER EXCEPT FOR HAVING TWO GAPS IN IT

IF WE ROLL A BALL ALONG THE GROUND TOWARD THE GAPS ONE OF TWO THINGS WILL HAPPEN EITHER IT'LL HIT THE WALL AND BOUNCE BACK OR IT'LL GO THROUGH ONE OF THE GAPS AND CONTINUE IN A STRAIGHT LINE UNTIL IT HITS A FAIRLY SPECIFIC POINT ON THE OTHER WALL OCCASIONALLY IT MIGHT JUST HIT THE EDGE OF THE GAP AND GO THROUGH AT A WEIRD ANGLE SO THEORETICALLY IT COULD HIT ANY POINT ON THE FAR WALL BUT USUALLY IT FOLLOWS SOMETHING CLOSE TO A STRAIGHT LINE PATHOLOGY THE BALL IS BEHAVING LIKE A CLASSICAL PARTICLE VERY SIMPLE

NOW IMAGINE WE FILL THIS ROOM WITH WATER AND WE MAKE A WAVE ON OUR SIDE OF THE ROOM OF COURSE THE WAVES WILL REACH BOTH HOLES ON THE OTHER SIDE THOSE WAVES WON'T JUST CONTINUE LIKE FOCUSED LASERS IN A PRECISE DIRECTION LIKE THE BALL DID THEY'LL RIPPLE OUT IN CIRCLES SORT OF AS IF THEY WERE EMITTED BY THOSE HOLES THEMSELVES MOREOVER THE CIRCULAR WAVES FROM THE TWO HOLES WILL RUN INTO EACH OTHER AND INTERACT RESULTING IN WHAT WE CALL AN INTERFERENCE PATTERN IF A PEAK FROM ONE WAVE RUNS INTO THE TROUGH FROM THE OTHER WAVE THEY'LL CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT SO THE WATERLINE ALONG THE BACK WALL AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT IS ACTUALLY SLIGHTLY COMPLEX AND INTERESTING IF THE WAVES ARE STRONG ENOUGH YOU'LL GET TURBULENCE BUT THAT'S WHERE OUR ANALOGY BREAKS DOWN

NOW PHYSICISTS IN THE CENTURY PERFORMED SIMILAR EXPERIMENTS ON A TINY SCALE THEY FIRED LIGHT STREAMS OF ELECTRONS AND OTHER THINGS AT A BARRIER WITH TINY SLITS ON IT AND PLACED A SCREEN ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SEE WHERE THE BEAM WOUND UP AND THE RESULTS WERE QUITE PERPLEXING NORMALLY WHETHER IT'S ELECTRONS OR PHOTONS THEY SAW THE TYPE OF DIFFRACTION PATTERN THEY WOULD EXPECT FROM A WAVE PASSING THROUGH BOTH SLITS THAT WASN'T SO SURPRISING FOR ALREADY THOUGHT LIGHT WAS A TYPE OF IT WAS PRETTY WEIRD FOR ELECTRONS IN FACT EVEN IF THEY FIRED ONE ELECTRON AT A TIME THEY STILL GOT THE SAME RESULT IT SEEMS TO PASS THROUGH BOTH SLITS AT THE SAME TIME THOSE PLACES WHERE THE WAVE PEAKS FROM ONE SLIT MEET THE WAVE TROUGHS FROM THE OTHER SLIT THE ELECTRON NEVER HITS THAT PART OF THE SCREEN EVEN IF THERE'S NO OTHER ELECTRON TO INTERFERE WITH IT WELL VERY RARELY HITS THAT PART OF THE SCREEN IT'S HARD FOR THE PROBABILITY TO BE EXACTLY ZERO BUT IF YOU BLOCK THE LEFT SLIT OR BLOCK THE RIGHT SLIT THE ELECTRON WILL SOMETIMES LAND IN THOSE PLACES A CRUDE WAY OF SAYING THIS IS THAT WE ARE FORCING THE ELECTRON TO TAKE JUST ONE PATH OF THE OTHER INSTEAD OF TAKING BOTH SIMULTANEOUSLY

WHAT IF WE WERE TO SET UP DETECTORS AT THE ENTRANCE TO EACH SLIT SO WE KNOW WHICH ONE IT WENT THROUGH THAT DESTROYS THE INTERFERENCE PATTERN TOO THIS GOES TO SHOW THERE'S NO WAY OF MEASURING THE ELECTRON'S POSITION WITHOUT CHANGING ITS BEHAVIOR
I ORIGINALLY WROTE THIS BASED ON SOME DISCUSSIONS I HAD IN R MATH THANKS FOR CROSSPOSTING HERE
THANKS U DEATH-FIRE FOR POSTING THIS I LOOK FORWARD TO READING THE CURRENT THREE ARTICLES IN THIS SERIES

COINCIDENTALLY I HAD JUST TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME COME ACROSS SOME OTHER ARTICLES BY ARNOLD NEUMAIER A PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIENNA I SEE THAT HE MAINTAINS A THEORETICAL PHYSICS FAQ WHICH HAS A CHAPTER WITH POSTS ON VIRTUAL PARTICLES AND VACUUM FLUCTUATIONS

I HAD READ IN THE PAST PROFESSOR MATT ARTICLE ON VIRTUAL PARTICLES WHAT ARE THEY WHICH I THOUGHT WAS QUITE GOOD SO I'LL BE INTERESTED IN FOLLOWING UP ON THAT WITH ARTICLES
WHOEVER WROTE THAT HAS DIFFICULTY COMMUNICATING

THE CONTENT IS THERE BUT ARTICULATED SO POORLY

THIS ISN'T EVEN A COHERENT CONCEPT LET ALONE A SENTENCE

NO ONE THERE WILL EVER ASK HOW IT CAN BE THAT TWO VIRTUAL PARTICLES CAN BEND AS IN A FEYNMAN DIAGRAM WITH A LOOP AND FIND EACH OTHER EXACTLY AT THE RIGHT PLACE AND WITH EXACTLY THE RIGHT MOMENTUM TO ANNIHILATE

THE ARTICLE IS LITTERED WITH THINGS LIKE THAT

THE AUTHOR SEEMS TO HAVE A GOOD GRASP OF THE MATERIAL BUT NEEDS A DAMN EDITOR
HOPEFULLY SWITCHING FROM ENGINEERING TO PHYSICS
QUANTIZED MY FIRST FIELD THIS WEEK I THINK I SHOULD CELEBRATE THIS MILESTONE
TRYING TO INTRODUCE SOME HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TO MODERN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH PRETTY FUN BUT EXHAUSTING
USING SIMULATIONS TO ANALYZE THE ORBITAL KINEMATICS OF SATELLITE GALAXIES TO THE MILKY WAY IN HOPES TO FIND SOME INTERESTING THINGS WITH LCD AT SMALL SCALES NOW I JUST NEED SOME OBSERVATIONAL DATA TO USE
TODAY THE PROFESSOR REALIZED THAT LITERALLY NONE OF THE CLASS HAS BEEN FOLLOWING HIS LECTURES ON INFLATION BUT WE ALL ASSUMED THAT EVERYONE ELSE HAD BEEN KEEPING UP
SAME AS LAST WEEK THE PARTICLE PHYSICS LECTURE IS STILL MY FAVORITE OVER SOLIDSTATEPHYSICS AND STATISTICAL THERMO

WE ARE BASICALLY DONE WITH OUR FIRST REPORT ON THE EXPERIMENT AND ARE JUST WORKING ON A CONCLUSION

THE SECOND EXPERIMENT WAS QUITE FRANCY RETARDED AS SHIT

GROUPS 2 MEASUREMENT DEVICES FIRST THE OTHER 2 GROUPS DID THEIR MEASUREMENTS AND WE HAD 2 HOURS TO PREPARE A PRESENTATION ON SOME STUFF WE ALL HAD LEARNED ABOUT WHILE PREPARING FOR THE EXPERIMENT

THEN WE SWITCHED GAVE THE PRESENTATIONS AFTERWARDS AND THEN STARTED THE REAL MEASUREMENT WHIT THE DATA IF IT BEING SEND TO US IN A WEEK

ANOTHER HILARIOUS THING WAS THE BRIEFING ON RADIATION PROTECTION

WE ARE DETERMINING THE LIFETIME OF MUONS SECONDARY MUONS GENERATED BY COSMIC RAYS HITTING THE ATMOSPHERE

THE NEXT EXPERIMENT WILL BE PHOTOEMISSION SPECTROSCOPY WHICH SEEMS TO TAKE A BIT MORE WORK THAN THE LAST TWO

ILL ALSO HAVE TO START LOOKING FOR A TOPIC FOR MY BACHELOR THESIS ALTHOUGH IM DEFINITELY GOING TO THE INFORMATIONS EVENTS OF ALL THE INSTITUTES FIRST I AM LEANING TOWARDS PANICLE PHYSICS THOUGH
ASIDE FROM APPLICATIONS USING SIMULATIONS TO MODEL THE FORMATION AND EVOLUTION OF GAS GIANTS I E PLANETS LIKE OUR JUPITER THIS IS DONE IN THE CONTEXT OF EXOPLANETS WHERE UNDERSTANDING THE FORMATION PROCESS IS CRITICAL IN DETERMINING THE MASS OF YOUNG MILLION TO TENS OF MILLION YEAR OLD GAS GIANTS
STARTING MY MASTER THESIS IN THEORETICAL PERTURBATIVE CD STILL NOT SURE WHAT THE TOPIC WILL BE EXACTLY THO
WRITING AND FINISHING MY BACHELOR THESIS TURNED OUT THE TOPIC YIELDED WAY HARDER PROBLEMS THAN ONE WOULD EXPECT FOR EXAMPLE AN EQUATION OF STATE THAT IMPLIES CAUSALITY BUT WHERE I ACTUALLY FAILED WAS THAT THE RESULTING FUNCTIONS OF THE ODE'S I WAS INTEGRATING WERE DISCONTINUOUS TOOK ME BASICALLY ALL MY ASSIGNED TIME TO FIND OUT WHY MY SOLUTIONS WERE OSCILLATING
TAKE HOME AP PHYS C TESTAMENT FREE YAY HAHA IT'S ON FAIRLY BASIC STUFF AS ITS JUST THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR WORK ENERGY STUFF BUT IT WAS MUCH NEEDED AS I JUST BOMBED A TEST ON FORCES THAT THERE WAS NO REASON I SHOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN OVER A ON OH WELL I'M NEW ON THIS SUB BUT I'VE LOVED PHYSICS EVER SINCE I WAS OR NEARLY NOW I'VE ALWAYS WATCHED VIDEOS AND READ ARTICLES ON MY OWN BUT IT'S SO GREAT TO FINALLY START LEARNING THIS STUFF
I'M TEACHING MATH AND SOMETIMES PHYSICS AS A PRIVATE TEACHER I HOPE TO GET MORE PHYSICS STUDENTS PUPILS SOON
DETECTING GRAVITY WAVES USING AIRGLOW EMISSIONS ACTUALLY RIGHT NOW I AM ORGANISING THE BULLSHIT THAT IS THE WORK OF MY PREDECESSORS SERIOUSLY HOW CAN ANYONE CONTINUE WHEN THEY CAN'T EVEN FIND THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE PROGRAMS YOU ARE USING OR THEY ARE SEVERELY LACKING IN THE COMMENT DEPARTMENT
JUST STARTED READING THROUGH THE FEYNMAN LECTURES FINALLY IT'S ACTUALLY A REALLY GOOD EXPLANATION OF INTRO PHYSICS AND CONSIDERING I'M HALFWAY THROUGH PHYSICS C I WISH I READ IT SOONER
I'M WORKING ON COMPILING SOME CODE TO WORK ON A NEW SBC FOR AN R D PROJECT I'M ON I WORK IN INDUSTRY DEVELOPING VARIOUS KIND OF RADIATION DETECTION TECHNOLOGIES FOR COMMERCIAL AND RESEARCH PURPOSES
WORKING WITH BEANT TO SIMULATE ELECTRON HYDROGEN INTERACTIONS FOR A PARTICLE PHYSICS EXPERIMENT
DOING MEDIOCRE ON A RELATIVITY EXAM
ANALYZING THE ATOMIC LINES OF SPECTRA OF RED SUPERGIANT STARS AND COMPARING THE EQUIVALENT WIDTH TO EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURE
THIS IS CALLED IMPOSTER SYNDROME AND IT'S VERY COMMON AT UNIVERSITY JUST REMEMBER THAT THEY LET YOU IN BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT YOU WERE SMART ENOUGH AND TRY NOT TO COMPARE YOURSELF TO OTHERS
YOU MAINLY JUST HAVE TO FOCUS ON YOURSELF AND IGNORE THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF OTHERS AROUND YOU EVEN IF IT IS RUDE FOCUS IS KEY
HALACHA WELCOME TO PHYSICS WHERE LITERALLY EVERYONE IS SMARTER AND MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN YOU

SERIOUSLY READ UP ON IMPOSTER SYNDROME IT WILL MAKE A LOT OF STUFF YOU'VE BEEN FEELING MAKE MORE SENSE AND I GUARANTEE THAT IF YOU BROUGHT THIS UP TO YOUR PEERS AND THEY WERE BEING HONEST THEY'D SAY THEY WERE FEELING THE SAME WAY

MY SUGGESTION IS TO PICK UP A HOBBY THAT SOUNDS IMPRESSIVELY DIFFICULT BUT IS ACTUALLY PRETTY EASY SOMETHING OUTSIDE OF THE NORMAL NERD CULTURE THAT I ASSUME PERMEATES YOUR DEPARTMENT
I THINK MOST PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THIS AT SOME POINT I KNOW I HAVE DO PARTLY THIS IS JUST A SUCCESS BIAS I EAST PEOPLE WILL ONLY TALK ABOUT POST ABOUT THE THINGS THEY SUCCEED AT NOT THE ONES THEY FAIL STRUGGLE AT ALSO I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT AS YOU MOVE ON IN LIFE SCHOOL UNDERGRAD POSTERIAD WORK YOU TEND TO SURROUND YOURSELF WITH MORE SKILLED DRIVEN PEOPLE WHO CAN COME ACROSS AS MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN THE PEOPLE YOU USED TO COMPARE YOURSELF WITH UNLESS YOU ARE REALLY STRUGGLING WITH THE WORK DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT FINISH YOUR DEGREE THEN COMPARE WHERE YOU ARE COMPARED TO WHERE YOU WERE WHEN YOU STARTED IF YOU HAVE FOUND SOMETHING YOU LOVE THEN CONSIDER YOURSELF LUCKY I KNOW MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL SEARCHING
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE PEOPLE AHEAD OF YOU AND PEOPLE BEHIND YOU THAT WILL BE UNIVERSAL FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE WHATS IMPORTANT IS THAT YOU DO THE BEST YOU CAN AT WHATEVER MAKES YOU HAPPY I KNOW THAT SOUNDS COMPLETELY CLICHE BUT ITS TRUE NOTHING MATTERS EXCEPT YOUR OWN HAPPINESS AND WELL BEING FIGURE OUT WHAT LIGHTS YOUR FIRE AND POUR AS MUCH FUEL AS YOU CAN INTO IT
HI I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THIS A LOT MYSELF RECENTLY I'M AND JUST ENTERED MY JUNIOR YEAR OF AN ENGINEERING PROGRAM AND I DIDN'T FIND MY LOVE FOR MATH AND PHYSICS UNTIL I WAS I JUST TRANSFERED FROM A COMMUNITY SCHOOL TO A WELL REGARDED SCHOOL AND YEAH IT'S INTIMIDATING WHAT I'VE BEEN FINDING HELPS ME AT LEAST IS TO TRY TO FORGET ABOUT THE OTHER STUDENTS I'M NOT HERE FOR THEM I'M HERE BECAUSE I FIND THIS STUFF EXCITING WORTHWHILE ON ITS OWN TRY YOUR BEST TO FOCUS ON WHY YOU WANT TO DO THE WORK AND THEN JUST DO YOUR BEST
I UNDERSTAND THIS FEELING ALL TOO WELL I OFTEN TIMES THINK THE SAME THING ALTHOUGH MY CIRCUMSTANCES ARE A BIT DIFFERENT I WAS KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL FOR REASONS AND HAVEN'T HAD THE FUNDS TO GO BACK I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT NO-ONE UNDERSTANDS YOUR ABILITIES AND LIMITATIONS MORE THAN YOURSELF AND THAT JUST ABOUT EVERYONE ELSE IT THINKING THE SAME THING TRY NOT TO GET HUNG UP ON THE QUEST FOR SUCCESS AND JUST ENJOY LEARNING WHILE YOU CAN
I'M IN A SIMILAR BOAT THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO IMPROVE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE I'M TALKING OF REAL SCIENCE LIKE REGULAR AEROBIC EXERCISE MINDFULNESS MEDITATION AND GENERALLY WORKING YOUR ASS OFF DAY AND NIGHT UNTIL YOUR BRAIN ADAPTS TO A HEAVIER TRUST ME YOUR LEARNING AND MEMORY WILL INCREASE OVER TIME IF YOU TRAIN HARD

BESIDES SOME SUBSTANCES LIKE BACOPA MONNIKER HAVE BEEN REPEATEDLY FOUND TO IMPROVE LEARNING AND MEMORY IN HUMANS AFTER WEEKS OF SUPPLEMENTATION HEAD OVER TO R NOOTROPICS FOR MORE INFORMATION BUT I DON'T RECOMMEND YOU START TAKING ANY OF THE POPULAR YET BARELY RESEARCHED SUBSTANCES
FINDING SOMETHING YOU LOVE IS HALF THE BATTLE IT DOESN'T MATTER IF OTHERS SEEM TO BE AHEAD OF YOU AS LONG AS YOU NEVER GIVE UP YOU'LL EVENTUALLY BE THE BEST
LOOK THE BIG SECRET TO LIFE IS THIS

IF YOU FIND SOMETHING YOU ARE PASSIONATE IN YOU WILL BE INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL AND LEARN FAR FASTER THAN PEOPLE JUST DOING THINGS FOR THE SAKE OF IT GUARANTEED

PEOPLE OFTEN MISTAKE INTELLIGENCE FOR WORK I'D SAY OVER OF PEOPLE CAN BECOME A DOCTOR BUT LESS THAN INVEST THE ENERGY AND TIME TO DO IT AS THEY DON'T HAVE THE PASSION

I LOOK AT IT AS EVERYONE HAS POINTS OF ENERGY PER DAY SOME PEOPLE SPEND OF THEM AT A JOB THEY HATE OF THEM DOING CHORES OF THEM WITH FAMILY AND THEN WATCHING TV DOWNTIME IF YOU HAVE FOUND SOMETHING WHICH YOU CAN DEDICATE POINTS TO DUE TO IT BEING YOUR PASSION THEN SUCCESS IS UNDENIABLE I PROMISE YOU
I'M IN THE SAME SITUATION I'M ALSO AND I'M ABOUT TO START STUDYING PHYSICS WITHOUT MUCH PRIOR KNOWLEDGE IN THE SUBJECT BUT THE CONCEPTS THAT I HAVE LEARNED HAVE DRAWN ME TO IT AND I FEEL LIKE IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I SHOULD BE STUDYING MY WORRY IS THAT ONCE I ACTUALLY GET INTO THE HARDER CLASSES I'LL REALIZE I'M NOT GOOD AT IT AND I'LL BE WASTING MY TIME
JUST DO WHAT YOU LIKE AND STICK TO IT
I DUNNO HOW JUST GOT OUT SOME CRAZY BLACK HOLE DEPRESSION MORE THAN YEARS AND GOT INTO PHYSICS I'M AND SOMETIMES JUST CAN'T HELP IT BUT FEEL LIKE SHIT EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT DOING BAD OR ANYTHING
ALWAYS TAKE THE PATH OF LEAST ACTION
WHILE THEY CAN SOUND IMPRESSIVE THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO IS THAT ARE MORE GEARED TOWARDS RESEARCH WHILE MASTERS DEGREES ARE MORE APPLIED SO IF YOU DON'T PLAN ON GOING INTO RESEARCH SCIENCE I WOULD SUGGEST DOING A BACHELOR'S IN APPLIED PHYSICS IF YOUR SCHOOL OFFERS THAT KIND OF CONCENTRATION AS THAT WILL GIVE YOU A BIT MORE OF A CONNECT FROM THE PURE PHYSICS TO THE ENGINEERING THEN FROM THERE A MASTERS IN WHATEVER ENGINEERING YOU WANT TO DO WOULD BE THE BEST BET
WHAT I THINK THEY MEAN BY THAT IS A PHOTON OF VISIBLE LIGHT WHICH HAS A CERTAIN WAVELENGTH RANGE AFTER ALL PHOTONS ARE THE QUANTA OF ALL ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION EAST G INFRARED ULTRAVIOLET ETC NOT JUST WAVELENGTHS VISIBLE TO THE EYE AS EXPLAINED HERE ILLUSTRATIVE GRAPHIC HERE
I WOULD SAY IN ADDITION TO WHAT U JRMDB SAID THEY TYPICALLY MEAN VISIBLE LIGHT SPECIFICALLY IT CAN BE WORTH SPECIFYING THAT THE UNIT OF LIGHT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS A PHOTON
I GUESS ANY HYPOTHETICAL CARRIER OF A U GAUGE FIELD COULD DUBBED A PHOTON OF SORTS EAST G DARK PHOTON

HOWEVER I'D SAY IT'S UNLIKELY THAT'S WHAT ANYONE USING THE PHRASE PHOTON OF LIGHT WOULD HAVE IN MIND
PHOTONS HAVE QUALITATIVELY DIFFERENT BEHAVIOUR DEPENDING UPON THEIR WAVELENGTH

PHOTONS OF VISIBLE LIGHT ARE EASILY REFLECTED BY MIRRORS AND REFRACTED BY GLASS PHOTONS OF MUCH SHORTER OR MUCH LONGER WAVELENGTH ARE NOT

IN SOME CONTEXTS IT'S BEING USED TO REFER TO THE SMALLEST DIVISIBLE AMOUNT OF EM RADIATION A SINGLE JUNTA THE SAME WAY A GRAIN IS THE SMALLEST UNIT OF SAND YOU MIGHT SAY SOMETHING LIKE THIS CHIP CAN DETECT A SINGLE PHOTON OF LIGHT
EVEN IF THERE ARE NOT OTHER TYPES OF PHOTONS THERE ARE CERTAINLY OTHER QUANTITIES OF LIGHT
IT'S KIND OF THE SAME THING AS SAYING A GAGGLE OF GEESE INSTEAD OF SAYING A GAGGLE IT ENSURES A MINIMUM OF AMBIGUITY THOUGH PHOTONS ARE WELL KNOWN TO BE THE NAME FOR A QUANTA OF LIGHT AND IS USUALLY SAID OUT OF HABIT
I SUPPOSE IT'S MEANT TO CLARIFY THAT IT'S A PHOTON NOT A WAVELENGTH THAT WE ARE DISCUSSING THEY COULD CERTAINLY DROP THE LIGHT BUT THEY COULDN'T DROP THE PHOTON
I PREFER AN ELECTROMAGNETIC PHOTON OF LIGHT
THERE ARE PERHAPS OTHER MASSLESS PARTICLES THAT TRAVEL AT C BUT THEY ARE NOT CALLED PHOTONS FOR EXAMPLE MANY PHYSICISTS THINK THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE IS CARRIED BY A MASSLESS PARTICLE THAT TRAVELS AT C CALLED A GRAVITON
YOU MIGHT HAVE A PHOTON OF IR UV GAMMA
A PHOTON OF LIGHT IS IN THE VISIBLE SPECTRUM
THE VISIBLE SPECTRUM IS THE PORTION OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM THAT IS VISIBLE TO THE HUMAN EYE ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION IN THIS RANGE OF WAVELENGTHS NM IS CALLED VISIBLE LIGHT OR SIMPLY LIGHT
MPH PLEASE RSVP
YOU ARE BLOWING THE HOT AIR AROUND THE FIRE AWAY AND PARTIALLY EXTINGUISHING THE FLAME WHILE ALSO INTRODUCING A GREAT DEAL OF OXYGEN RICH AIR THIS MAKE A MUCH LARGER TEMPERATURE GRADIENT THAN EXISTED BEFORE WHILE ALSO INCREASING THE COMBUSTION RATE LOCALLY WHICH PRODUCES EVEN MORE HEAT THIS TEMPERATURE GRADIENT RAPIDLY HEATS THE AIR AROUND WHATEVER IS BURNING AND PARTIALLY REIGNITES THE FLAME LOWERING THE DENSITY OF THE AIR WHICH EXPANDS OUTWARD RAPIDLY THERE ARE NOW TWO COMPETING FORCES YOUR BREATH AND THE FIRES VOLUMETRIC HEATING EXPANSION THIS CREATES A HARMONIC OSCILLATION WHICH YOU HEAR AS SOUND SO BASICALLY A COMBINATION OF YOUR TWO CONJECTURES

I THINK YOUR ISSUE IS THAT YOU CAN'T IMAGINE A GAS ACTING AS A SPEAKER DIAPHRAGM AS WE ARE CLAIMING A FIRE DOES BUT THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME CONSIDER THE NOISE IN A FAST MOVING CAR WITH ITS WINDOWS OPEN THIS NOISE IS CAUSED BY THE RAPID MOVEMENT OF AIR IN AND OUT OF THE WINDOWS THERE'S NO SOLID BODY MOVING THE AIR IT'S JUST BEING PUSHED THAT WAY BY THE TURBULENT OSCILLATION OF THE AIR MOVING AROUND THE CAR SIMILARLY WHEN YOU FIRE A GUN LOADED WITH BLANKS THERE'S NO SOLID BULLET TO MAKE THE NOISE JUST THE RAPIDLY EXPANDING GAS CAUSED BY THE EXPLOSION OF THE GUNPOWDER OR WHEN A LIGHTNING BOLT RAPIDLY HEATS AND EXPANDS THE AIR AROUND IT PRODUCING THUNDER
GREAT QUESTION I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE BUT MAYBE IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE MOVING AIR PARTICLES BEING LOWER DENSITY AND THE HOT AIR FROM THE FIRE RUSHES IN QUICKLY THE RUSHING IN OF THE HOT AIR ISN'T CONSTANT DUE TO TURBULENCE AND SO SOMETIMES IT MOVES FAST AND THEN NOT SO FAST AND THEN FAST AGAIN IN A SOMEWHAT RANDOM FASHION THE VARIABLE SPEED OF THE AIR MAKES VARYING WAVES IN THE AIR AND SO YOU GET THE FLUTTERING SOUND

THAT PROBABLY ISN'T CORRECT THOUGH
I'D HAVE TO ASSUME IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE MAKING THE REACTION LESS EFFICIENT BY COOLING IT YES YOU ARE ADDING MORE OXYGEN BUT YOU'RE ALSO INCREASING HEAT TRANSFER
I DON'T KNOW EITHER BUT I HAVE ANOTHER GUESS THE COLD AND HOT AIR MIX TO CREATE VORTEXES AND AS THE TURBULENT VORTEX DISSIPATES INTO THE SURROUNDING AIR THAT ENERGY TURNS INTO AUDIBLE WHITE NOISE JUST LIKE ALL OTHER TURBULENT FLUID FLOW

SO MY GUESS WOULD BE THAT WHEN YOU BLOW ON A FLAME BUT NOT HARD ENOUGH TO PUT IT OUT YOU ARE BASICALLY CREATING A BUNCH OF TINY TORNADOES IN THE FLAME AND THAT WHITE NOISE SOUND YOU HEAR IS THE ENERGY FROM THE TURBULENCE DISSIPATING INTO THE SURROUNDING AIR

SOMEONE MORE EXPERT THAN ME COULD PROBABLY BETTER EXPLAIN HOW TURBULENT FLUID FLOW PRODUCES SOUND
YES IN MY EXPERIENCE THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME MISTAKES IN Y F'S UNIVERSITY PHYSICS MOSTLY FROM ANSWERS NOT BEING UPDATED FROM PREVIOUS EDITIONS WHICH USED DIFFERENT VALUES FOR VARIOUS QUANTITIES

BETWEEN THAT AND MASTERING PHYSICS I'M DEVELOPING A KEEN HATRED FOR ANYTHING EVEN REMOTELY RELATED TO PEARSON
I HAVE NO EXPERIENCE WITH BOOKS BUT IF YOU WANT TO LOOK INTO ALTERNATIVES A VERY POPULAR TEXT BOOK FOR PHYSICS IS PHYSICS FOR SCIENTISTS ENGINEERS BY GIANCOLI PERFECT FOR INTRODUCTIONARY COURSES INTO CLASSICAL MECHANICS FOR A MORE ADVANCED TEXT BOOK ABOUT CLASSICAL MECHANICS YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK INTO CLASSICAL MECHANICS BY JOHN ROYAL TAYLOR
THERE IS A SITE OUT THERE WITH ALL OF THE ANSWERS TO Y F UNIVERSITY PHYSICS WORKED OUT PERHAPS IF YOU CAN FIND THIS YOU'D BE ABLE TO SEE IF YOUR METHODS ARE CORRECT AND THEY ARE PLUGGING IN DIFFERENT NUMBERS DUE TO PREVIOUS EDITIONS IF THE ANSWER KEY IS GIVING YOU THE ANSWER TO A DIFFERENT PROBLEM OR SOMETHING I THINK IF YOU JUST GOOGLE UNIVERSITY PHYSICS SOLUTION MANUAL THERE'S A GITHUB THAT POPS UP WITH DFS OF ALL THE CHAPTERS
WELL FIRST ELECTRON ORBITALS ARE ONLY EXACT FOR HYDROGEN SO FOR ANY KIND OF ATOM THE ELECTRON ENERGY LEVELS AND THEIR SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION IS DIFFERENT CHEMISTS USUALLY USE SOME KIND OF ORBITAL HYBRIDIZATION MODEL TO STUDY THIS I'VE SEEN THIS MOSTLY IN THE CONTEXT OF MOLECULAR ORBITALS BUT IT SHOULD BE TRUE WITHIN ATOMS AS WELL

WHEN ORBITALS HYBRIDIZE THEY DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU SUGGEST THAT THEY SHOULD DO IMAGINE HELIUM IN A PARTICULAR EXCITED STATE FOR EXAMPLE THE ELECTRON CONFIGURATION OF AN EXCITED HELIUM STATE IF IT WERE NONINTERACTING COULD BE THESE 2 ORBITALS OVERLAP SIGNIFICANTLY SO INTRODUCING THE ELECTRON INTERACTIONS WOULD RAISE THE AVERAGE ENERGY OF THIS UNCORRELATED STATE SIGNIFICANTLY WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT INSTEAD THE ORBITALS HYBRIDIZE YOU GET APPROXIMATELY 2 NEW ORBITALS MADE OUT OF THE 2 ONES AND THE PLACES WHERE THESE NEW HYBRID ORBITALS DIFFER FROM THE ONES THE MOST ARE PRECISELY WHERE THE ORBITALS OVERLAP ROUGHLY SPEAKING AREAS OF OVERLAP REPEL EACH OTHER TO CREATE NEW ORBITALS WHERE THE ELECTRONS ARE ON AVERAGE FARTHER AWAY FROM EACH OTHER THAN THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE ORBITALS

THE OTHER THING YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THAT FOR ATOMS PLOTS OF THE SPATIAL DENSITY CAN BE MISLEADING THE ELECTRON POSITIONS ARE NOT UNCORRELATED I'M NOT SURE BUT I BET THAT THEY ARE CORRELATED IN PRECISELY THE WAY YOU SUGGEST WHEN ONE ELECTRON IS IN A CERTAIN PLACE IT IS VERY UNLIKELY TO FIND THE SECOND ELECTRON NEARBY IT'S PROBABLY MOST LIKELY TO FIND IT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE NUCLEUS OR SOMETHING APPROXIMATELY LIKE THAT

THE PROBLEM WITH CONFIGURATIONS WHERE THE 2 ELECTRONS ARE EXACTLY LOCKED ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE NUCLEUS FROM EACH OTHER OR EXACTLY EQUIDISTANT FROM EACH OTHER IS THAT THOSE STATES HAVE THE LOWEST AVERAGE POTENTIAL ENERGY BUT THEY HAVE VERY HIGH AVERAGE KINETIC ENERGY IF YOU IMAGINE THAT AN ELECTRON IS LOCALIZED TO A SMALL AREA VERY FAR FROM THE OTHER ONE THEN YOU CAN THINK ABOUT IT AS BEING APPROXIMATELY A GAUSSIAN WAVEPACKET WITH SOME SMALL VARIANCE VERB THE FOURIER TRANSFORM OF THIS WAVEPACKET WILL BE A GAUSSIAN IN BUT WITH A VARIANCE VERB THE SMALLER YOU MAKE V TO LOCK THE ELECTRONS EQUIDISTANT FROM EACH OTHER THE WIDER YOU MAKE THE DISTRIBUTION IN INCREASING THE AVERAGE KINETIC ENERGY
MY GUESS WOULD BE THAT INTERACTIONS ARE DOMINANT ONLY AT SMALL DISTANCES ONCE YOU GET TO LARGE DISTANCES I EAST RADII OF ATOMS THESE INTERACTIONS ARE NEGLIGIBLE

I DO KNOW THAT THESE INTERACTIONS ARE COMPLEX BUT I'M AFRAID THIS IS THE BEST ANSWER I CAN GIVE HOPEFULLY SOMEONE WHO KNOWS MORE WILL GIVE MORE INSIGHT
THE VIDEO IS LINKED HOPE IT WORKS I TURNED IT OFF ONCE IF I LEAVE IT OFF FOR A WHILE THE MOVEMENT STOPS AND BEGINS GRADUALLY ONCE I TURN IT ON AGAIN

MY QUESTION IS WHETHER IT IS ACTUALLY MOVING PHYSICALLY OR IT IS JUST BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY FLUCTUATING ENOUGH TO CAUSE A FLUCTUATION IN THE EMITTED LIGHT
DELETED
IF THERE IS A MAGNETIC FIELD AROUND THE BULB THEN THE ALTERNATING CURRENT GOING THROUGH THE FILAMENT WILL CAUSE MOTION LIKE THAT
THATS HOW THIS BULB DOES IT
ALL OF THEM EVENTUALLY
I WROTE THIS LAST TIME I SAW THIS QUESTION ASKED ON R THEYDIDTHEMATH I BELIEVE

IF ANYBODY DIES AT ALL IT'S EAST THAT ROCK IS MISSING A HUGE CHUNK AND IS DANGEROUSLY IMBALANCE A CYLINDER BECAUSE WHO WOULD CUT A SLOT LIKE THAT IN A SPHERE 2 M IN DIAMETER AND M WIDE MADE OF GRANITE KG WOULD WEIGH APPROXIMATELY TONS THE SLOT LOOKS ABOUT M IN DIAMETER SO THAT REMOVES TONS FOR A TOTAL OF TONS OF GRANITE

LET'S SAY THE COUNTERPOINT OF THE SLOT IS M FROM THE CENTER OF THE ROCK THE SLOT IS ABOUT THE MASS OF THE WHOLE ROCK SO OUR BIG SLOTTED CENTER OF GRAVITY SHIFTS M BELOW IT'S CIRCULAR CENTER AT A FULL DEGREES OF ROTATION THIS IMBALANCE GENERATES A TORQUE OF NEARLY NM EVEN PUSHING AT THE VERY TOP OF THE ROCK FOR A MAXIMUM 2 M LEVER ACTION WHICH IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE E CAN EVEN REACH IT WOULD STILL REQUIRE OVER N TO OVERCOME THE MOMENT OF ROLLING BACK

ACCORDING TO THE CANADIAN CENTRE FOR OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY A WORKER SHOULD NEVER EXCEED N OF HORIZONTAL PUSHING FORCE OR N IF HE CAN BRACE HIMSELF AGAINST A SOLID OBJECT WE CAN ASSUME THESE NUMBERS ARE CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN MAXIMUM POSSIBLE VALUES FOR SAFETY PURPOSES BUT THAT STILL REQUIRES MR E TO EXERT X THE RECOMMENDED MAXIMUM PUSHING FORCE UNDER IDEAL PUSHING CIRCUMSTANCES AND HE IS BOTH LACKING SOMETHING TO BRACE AGAINST AND TOO SHORT TO REACH OPTIMAL LEVERAGE ON THE ROCK

AT M FROM THE EDGE THE ROCK WILL HAVE ROTATED HALF A RADIAN OR DEGREES ONCE DIRECTLY OVER THE CUSP THIS BRINGS THE COM M OUT OF LINE AND INTRODUCES NM OF TOTAL TO SHIFT THE COM M FURTHER LATERALLY THE APPROXIMATE TIPPING POINT OF THE ROCK IT MUST ROTATE AN ADDITIONAL DEGREES BUT THIS ADDS A NEGLIGIBLE AMOUNT OF TORQUE IF WE TAKE THE DRAWING AT FACE VALUE E IS PUSHING LATERALLY HALFWAY UP THE ROCK SO HE GETS M OF LEVERAGE AND MUST EXERT N OF FORCE TO MOVE IT

N OF LATERAL PUSH IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FORCE THAT'S ALMOST KG OR LBS AND CLOSER TO MAXIMUM RECOMMENDED PUSH WITHOUT BRACING IT IS UNLIKELY E CAN MUSTER THE STRENGTH TO EVEN GET THE ROCK OVER THE EDGE AT WHICH POINT HE WILL FALTER UNDER THE IMMENSE STRAIN PLACED ON HIS BODY SLIP AND FALL TO THE GROUND BEHIND THE ROCK AND BE SLOWLY CRUSHED TO DEATH

IT MAY BE POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO BUILD ENOUGH INERTIA IN THE EARLY STAGES OF PUSHING TO JUST BARELY GET THE ROCK OVER THE EDGE OR DO SOME LAME BACK AND FORTH RESONANCE MANEUVER BUT IN THAT CASE NOBODY DIES AT ALL AND E SULKS AWAY IN SHAME
IF THE RAMP BELOW E IS TEFLON THEN D WILL DIE
DEAR PEOPLE WHO KNOW HOW TO ANIMATION

WILL YOU PLEASE PLEASE ANIMATE ANY OR ALL OF THE POSSIBILITIES DISCUSSED BY THE EXCELLENT PHYSCSICISTS IN THIS THREAD

THANK YOU

ME
I DON'T THINK IT'S ANSWERABLE IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY

WE CAN PRESUME THE TWO ROUND OBJECTS ARE MADE OF THE SAME MATERIAL BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THEY LOOK ALIKE BUT WE CAN'T BE SURE SO THE LEVER AT C COULD COME DOWN AND SQUISH THE FIGURE IF THE DENSITY OF THE ROLLING STONE IS SUFFICIENTLY HIGHER

ALSO IT LOOKS LIKE THE ROLLING STONE WOULD SMASH THE FELLA AT D IN THE HEAD BUT HE HAS PLENTY OF SPACE TO JUST DUCK

ASSUMING SIMILAR ENOUGH OBJECT DENSITIES THE ANSWER IS NO ONE DIES THEY JUST DID THIS TO HAVE A GOOD STORY TO TELL DOWN AT THE PUB
NOBODY APPARENTLY

BUT PROBABLY

EDIT THIS IS MY FAVORITE

D NOBODY ELSE

THE CRESCENT BLOCK ISNT HEAVY ENOUGH TO OUTWEIGH THE COMPLETE BLOCK SO A B AND C ARE SAFE IM ASSUMING D CANNOT DUCK AND WHILE IM NOT COMPLETELY CERTAIN IF I CALCULATED IT CORRECTLY CHANCES ARE GOOD HIS HEAD WILL GET HIT BY THE CRESCENT BLOCK
D ONLY

ROLLING DISTANCE IS ABOUT 2 PI R SLOPE SO FULL ROTATION AND SQUISH

HOLE IN DISK MEANS IT IS LIGHTER THAN THE WHOLE DISK SO NO IMBALANCE THE ONLY TRICKY BIT IS THE BUMP ON ABOVE C WILL IT CAUSE DOWNWARD FORCE AS DISK ROLLS OVER IT AT SPEED I DON'T THINK SO AS IT IS ONLY R DISTANCE FROM THE CENTRE FULCRUM WHILE WHOLE BALL IS AND THE BUMP IS ALMOST HORIZONTAL SO DOWNWARD FORCE WILL BE MINIMAL
I THINK IT SOMEWHAT DEPENDS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE BALL WITH THE GAP ACTUALLY GETS TO THE POINT WHERE THE GAP IS AT THE BOTTOM IT CERTAINLY WOULDN'T JUST ROLL THE EXACT SAME WAY AS A COMPLETE BALL WOULD IT MIGHT BE CLOSE ENOUGH BUT IT MIGHT ALSO BUMP OR SLIDE IN AN UNPREDICTABLE WAY

BUT IF IT DOES ROLL LIKE A REGULAR BALL THEN D TAKES A SHOT TO THE FACE IT ROLLS ROUGHLY A COMPLETE CIRCUMFERENCE DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU START COUNTING FROM BUT WHEN IT HITS D THE GAP IS AT THE TOP

AFTER THAT IT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH MOMENTUM IT HAS AS OTHERS HAVE NOTED IT PROBABLY DOESN'T KILL C BUT I WONDER IF IT HAS ENOUGH SPEED TO KIND OF FLICK JUMP BUMP OVER THE SOLID BALL AFTER HITTING THE LITTLE CHOCK ON THE SEESAW AND KILL A OR B ITSELF
THE SCALE WON'T TIP UNLESS THE BALLS ARE VERY INELASTIC AND THE WALLS ARE INDESTRUCTIBLE THIS IS DUE TO THE SMALL LEDGE PRESENT AFTER D AND BEFORE C WHICH NEGATES DOWNWARD INERTIA A B AND C ARE SAFE E IS SAFE HE CAN PUSH WITH VERY LITTLE FORCE AND STILL MOVE THE STONE

THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE ROLLING STONE IS PI IT STARTS IN AN UPRIGHT POSITION AND ROLLS ABOUT THE TRIANGLE HYPOTENUSE OF RADII THEREFORE IS ABOUT UPRIGHT WHEN IT CRUSHES D ASSUMING THE STONE DOESN'T SLIP
E BECAUSE THE BOULDER IS ROLLING TO THE RIGHT AT A SPEED MUCH TOO FAST FOR HIM TO STOP IT
NONE
SPEAKING AS IF THIS WERE ACTUAL PHYSICS D AND C ARE THE ONLY ONES WITH A CHANCE OF DEATH AS LONG AS E IS THE ONLY ONE TO MOVE IF THE HOLE LINES UP AS IT LOOKS LIKE IT DOES D SHOULD LIVE AND IF THAT FULCRUM LEAVER ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO HOLD THE WEIGHT OF THE ROCK WITHOUT SNAPPING C WILL LIVE AS WELL SINCE THE ROCK WITH THE GAPING HOLE IS LESS DENSE THEN THE OTHER ROCK AND IT NEVER DROPS TO GIVE IT DOWNWARD MOMENTUM IT SHOULD JUST ROLL RIGHT UP AGAINST THE OTHER STONE NEVER EFFECTING THE TWO ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL

BUTTTTTTTT THIS IS GAMEPHYSICS E WILL PUSH THE ROCK HIS HANDS WILL STAY ON IT AND STRETCH WITH IT AS IT FLIES ALL OVER THE SCREEN MURDERING EVERYONE
AM I THE ONLY DISAPPOINTED THERE ISN'T A GIF OF THE RESULTS
E CAN'T MOVE THAT HEAVY OF A ROCK HE PUSHES IT SLIPS OFF THE CLIFF TO THE RIGHT AND DIES
B IS DEAD

E ALIVE AT ALL TIMES

D CAN DUCK ALIVE AT ALL TIMES

A C ALIVE ONLY IF THE FOLLOWING IS TRUE

SINCE THE TOP ROCK HAS A PORTION CUT OUT IT WOULD BE LIGHTER THAN THE BOTTOM ROCK SINCE THEY HAVE SIMILAR SIZE THE SEESAW WILL NOT GO DOWN SO C IS ALIVE

SINCE THE TOP ROCK LET'S SAY THE ROCK KEEPS IT'S SHAPE AND NOT BREAK STILL TRAVELS DOWN WITH SOME MOMENTUM AND THE SEESAW ACTS AS AN EXTENDED RAMP LITTLE BUMP ON THERE TO HELP IT FLY OVER THE BOTTOM ROCK A IS ALIVE B IS DEAD
DOESN'T D THE STONE WILL MAKE ALMOST ROTATION BY MY CALCULATION WHEN IT NEEDS TO MAKE A LITTLE UNDER HALF A ROTATION TO SPARE D IT WILL TRAVEL UNITS JUST A BIT MORE TO HIT D AND IT APPEARS TO HAVE RADIUS C SO IT WILL MAKE I REVOLUTIONS WHICH IS WHICH IS

I DON'T KNOW MY LEVEL PHYSICS WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW IF MOMENTUM FROM FALLING FROM A GREATER HEIGHT THAN THE RESTING STONE AT THE BOTTOM IS GOING TO KILL C OR BE ENOUGH TO LIFE THE STONE OVER B I VERY MUCH DOUBT IT'LL EVER HIT A THOUGH
I'M GOING TO GO WITH B C AND D I DON'T EVEN GET HOW E IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN DANGER
THIS WOULD BE A MUCH MORE SATISFYING POST IF IT WERE A GIF
WHAT WEIGHTS AND MATERIAL WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR THE ROUND OBJECTS IN ORDER FOR A TO DIE
ALL OF THEM I HOPE
WAIT IS A KIND OF YOU KNOW EXCITED BY ALL THIS AND POSSIBLY A BIT FREAKISH IN THE JUNKULAR REGION OF HIS ANATOMY
HAS ANYONE ASSUMED IT IS MADE OF RUBBER
NO ONE
DEPENDS ON THE THE SPEED OF THE PUSH THE FRICTION PROPERTIES BETWEEN THE BOULDER AND THE SURFACE AND THE RELATIVE MASS OF THE MOVING BOULDER TO THE STATIONARY BOULDER
YOU CAN SEE WHY THE BOLSONS EVENTUALLY REJECTED THIS AND WENT FOR THE FLAYED MAN AS THEIR SIGIL INSTEAD
EVERYONE LIVES HOLLOWED OUT ROCK DOESN'T IMPACT D BECAUSE AT THAT POINT IN ITS ROTATION THE HOLLOW PART WILL ROLL OVER D'S HEAD THE HOLLOWED OUT ROCK WEIGHS LESS THAN THE SOLID ONE SO THE ACTION STOPS WITH THE HOLLOWED OUT ROCK SITTING ON THE TEETER TOTTER
EVERYONE GETS OUT OF THE WAY E GOES TO PRISON FOR ATTEMPTED MANSLAUGHTER C GETS HOSPITALIZED FOR ATTEMPTED SUICIDE
PUSHING GIANT ROCKS LIKE THESE IS NOT EASY AUTH HUMAN FORCE BALANCING GIANT ROCKS EXIST ON EARTH
REMINDME HOURS ANSWER
PLOT TWIST FRICTION IS NEGLIGIBLE
WE ALL DIE EVENTUALLY MUCHACHA
NONE WILL DIE BECAUSE THESE DRAWINGS HAVE NO POTENTIAL ENERGY
IF ONE OF THEM IS KRAFT PUNK HE WON'T DIE
WHAT'S THE REAL ANSWER
IF REDDIN TAUGHT ME ANYTHING IT'S THAT THEY ALL DIE SINCE NOBODY HAS SHOES
D DIES MOMENTUM OF LOPSIDED ROCK ENDS UP PASSING QUICKLY AND HITTING THE RAMP AND BLOCKING THE NEXT BIG ROCK
EITHER B OR A

EVERYONE AFTER SISYPHUS E FINALLY PUSHES HIS LAST ROCK HE FALLS OFF THE BACK BREAKING HIS NECK

D SMARTLY DUCKS THINKING HIMSELF SAFE BUT THE WEIGHT OF THE ROCK TUMBLING DOWN TRAPS HIM UNTIL DEATH

IT ALSO SNAPS THE WOOD C IS UNDERNEATH KILLING HIM

IN A COMPLETELY UNRELATED NOTE A IS SUICIDAL BUT CANT LOOK AT HIS OWN DEATH SO GOES FOR A BACK FLIP BOTH A AND B HAVE WEAK NECKS THEY BOTH DIE WHEN THEY CONNECT
ONLY E DIES D CAN SIMPLY DUCK AWAY AND THE ROCK WILL CRASH INTO THE OTHER ROCK CAUSING AND THEY BOTH WILL COME TO REST ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE LEVER

HOWEVER A B C AND D WILL BE VERY ANGRY AT E FOR TRYING TO KILL THEM AND SEEK REVENGE
B C AND D
A DIES HIT BY LAUNCHED PROJECTILE
B
B
B
ALL WILL DIE FROM OLD AGE
REMINDME HOURS ANSWER
I THINK THE BEST ONES ACHIEVABLE WITHOUT SERIOUS ENGINEERING WOULD BE

THE GEIGER COUNTER AND RADIOACTIVE SOURCE APPROACH FROM PROBABLY USING AN ALDUINO KIT
UNPREDICTABLE SIGNAL NOISE USING A TRANSISTOR

THE SECOND ONE IS PROBABLY EASIEST TO ADAPT TO THE ANDROID

OR YOU CAN TRY IF YOU WANT RANDOM BITS USE THE TWITTER API TO GET THE LAST TWEETS AND COUNT THE CHARACTERS IF ODD ZERO IF EVEN
GIVEN THAT THE ONLY SOURCE OF HEAT IN THIS SITUATION IS THE HAND ITSELF YOUR QUESTION SHOULD BE HOW CAN I MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF HEAT LOST FROM MY HANDS

CONSIDERING THIS AND THAT WE ARE ONLY CHANGING THE SHAPE OF OUR HEAT SOURCE WE WANT TO MINIMIZE THE SURFACE AREA OF ONE'S HANDS THAT ARE EXPOSED TO THE HEAT SINK GIVEN THAT A SPHERE IS THE OBJECT WITH THE HIGHEST VOLUME TO SURFACE AREA RATIO ONE WOULD WANT TO MAKE ONE'S HANDS ARE CLOSE TO A PERFECT SPHERE AS POSSIBLE

SO UNLESS SOMEONE CAN CONTORTION THEIR HANDS ODDLY ID IMAGINE MAKING A FIST AND COVERING IT WITH THE OTHER HAND WOULD BE THE MOST EFFICIENT


NOW THIS IS A FIRST ORDER ESTIMATE AND DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT HEAT DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL FINGERS THE BULK OF THE HAND BUT I DONT KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THAT TO TELL YOU MORE
THINK OF YOUR HAND LIKE A FIN OR A HEAT SINK YOU'D SEE ON A CIRCUIT BOARD THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BEING THAT THE GOAL IS TO RETAIN RATHER THAN DISPEL AS MUCH HEAT AS POSSIBLE

THERE ARE MODES OF HEAT TRANSFER CONDUCTION CONVECTION AND RADIATION ALL OF THESE ARE DEPENDENT ON THE SURFACE AREA NORMAL TO THE DIRECTION OF HEAT FLOW LIKE ANY OTHER TYPE OF FLUX IN GENERAL HIGHER A MEANS HIGHER Q WHERE Q IS THE RATE OF HEAT TRANSFER SINCE HEAT ALWAYS MOVES FROM A HOT TO A COLD PLACE DUE TO THE 2ND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS Q IS THE RATE OF TRANSFER OF HEAT FROM YOUR HANDS TO THE ENVIRONMENT THIS MEANS THAT THE SMALLEST Q WOULD CORRESPOND TO THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE OUTER SURFACE AREA SO MAKING A FIST WITH ONE HAND AND COVERING IT WITH THE OTHER

NOTE THAT THIS IS A VAST OVERSIMPLIFICATION IN REALITY YOUR FIST IS NOT THE SAME AS A HOMOGENOUS SPHERE OF MATERIAL HOWEVER THIS IS THE PROBABLY THE BEST AND MOST PRACTICAL EXPLANATION THAT CAN BE GIVEN WITHOUT SOME SORT OF SIMULATION OR EXPERIMENTATION
YOU SHOULD ASK AT THE PHYS S DEPARTMENT OF YOUR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE

MY GUESS WOULD BE THE MASTERS IN PHYSICS IS BETTER
I TEACH AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE REQUIREMENTS CAN CERTAINLY VARY BUT I CAN AT LEAST GIVE YOU AN IDEA WE REQUIRE ALL OF OUR FACULTY TO HAVE A MASTERS DEGREE AND AT LEAST CREDITS OF COURSES IN THE DISCIPLINE THAT YOU ARE TEACHING
SETS FUNCTIONS AND LOGIC AN INTRODUCTION TO ABSTRACT MATHEMATICS THIRD EDITION BY KEITH DEVLIN

THE EXACT PAGE YOU LINKED CAN BE FOUND ON PAGE ON THIS PREVIEW
EITHER OF THE TWO MUNICH ONES LUDWIG MAXIMILIAN OR THE TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OR HEIDELBERG YOU CAN ALSO TRY THE SWISS FEDERAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY IN ZURICH ETH OR LAUSANNE EFL ETH IS JOINT GERMAN ENGLISH AND EFL IS JOINT FRENCH ENGLISH

YOUNG UNIVERSITY PHYSICS IS THE STANDARD FIRST YEAR UNDERGRADUATE TEXTBOOK AT LEAST IN THE UK YOU CAN ALSO READ LECTURES FREE ONLINE WHICH PROVIDE A SLIGHTLY LESS TECHNICAL BUT ALSO MORE INTERESTING DISCUSSION OF BROADER PHYSICS

CAREERS ARE WIDE RANGING YOU CAN STAY IN ACADEMIA OF COURSE BUT THERE ARE ALSO PLENTY OF APPLICATIONS OF PHYSICS IN INDUSTRY THEN THERE ARE THE USUAL CONSULTANCY PFC KCMG ETC AND HEDGE FUND USUALLY AS A QUANT ANALYST OPTIONS REALLY ANYTHING THAT ASKS FOR STRONG MATHEMATICAL SKILLS

MOST PHD COURSES REQUIRE AN MSC AS A PREREQUISITE AS FAR AS I KNOW
UNIVERSITY DOESN'T REALLY MATTER ALL THAT MUCH I'VE NEVER MET ANYONE WHO CARED WHERE YOU DID YOUR BACHELOR IT MATTERS A LITTLE MORE FOR THE MASTER BUT I'D STILL SAY IT'S NOT ALL TOO IMPORTANT IF YOU WANT TO GO TO THE BEST CHOOSE TU MUNICH IN GENERAL THE UNIVERSITIES IN THE EXZELLENZINITIATIVE SHOULD ALL PROVIDE A NICE ENVIRONMENT INCLUDING THOSE THAT WERE IN THE INITIATIVE AND LATER FELL OUT AGAIN LIKE THE KARLSRUHE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY


BOOKS FOR BEGINNER'S I'D SAY DEMTRÖDER EXPERIMENTALPHYSIK ARE THE BEST BOOKS FOR THE BSC EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS COURSES AT LEAST AND 2 ARE FOR AND THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES THAT I LIKE BETTER BUT THOSE ARE SOME TIME OFF FOR YOU ANYWAY

DON'T STOP WITH THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE FROM READING THIS SUBREDDIT I GET THE IMPRESSION THAT THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT IN THE US BUT HERE THE BACHELOR DEGREE IS BASICALLY WORTH NOTHING YOU NEED AN MSC FOR GOOD CHANCES OF EMPLOYMENT IF YOU HAVE ONE THE OUTLOOK IS PRETTY POSITIVE THOUGH THE DPW DEUTSCHE PHYSIKALISCHE GESELLSCHAFT RELEASES STUDIES ON THE LABOR MARKET FOR PHYSICISTS IN REGULAR INTERVALS AND RIGHT NOW IT'S BASICALLY FULL EMPLOYMENT FOR PHYSICISTS WITH A MASTER OR HIGHER

THERE ARE GRAD SCHOOLS BUILD AFTER THE AMERICAN MODEL WHERE YOU CAN BASICALLY START WITH YOUR PHD RIGHT AFTER YOU BACHELOR IT'S NOT THE NORM THOUGH MOST OF THE TIME YOU'LL HAVE TO FINISH YOU MASTER BEFORE STARTING YOUR PHD

SALARY IS SHITTY IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUR SALARY AS A YOU'LL BE MAKING MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR A LIVING AFTER TAXES FROM MY EXPERIENCE BUT YOU'RE BOUND TO MAKE MUCH MORE IN INDUSTRY

IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THIS I SUGGEST TO LOOK INTO THE REPORT FROM THE DPW YOU'LL FIND SALARIES EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS ETC
VEROEFFENTLICHUNG BROSCHUEREN STUDIED ARBEITSMARKTSTUDIE

KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS ABOUT THE CURRENT SITUATION THOUGH NOBODY CAN TELL YOU HOW IT WILL LOOK LIKE WHEN YOU FINISH


NOW ADVICE
UNIVERSITY IS NOT SCHOOL SO NOBODY WILL CARE IF YOU FALL BEHIND AND NOBODY WILL TELL YOU TO DO YOUR HOMEWORK IN FACT IF YOU DON'T DO IT YOUR TUTOR WILL MOST LIKELY BE HAPPY BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE TO CORRECT YOUR STUFF AND CAN INSTEAD WORK ON HIS THESIS YOU'LL NEED TO ADJUST TO THAT AND FIND YOU OWN MOTIVATION

2 FIND A STUDY GROUP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IT MAKES STUDYING MUCH MORE FUN AND MUCH LESS WORK YOU CAN ALSO HELP EACH OTHER OUT WHICH IS A MAJOR ADVANTAGE

DON'T BUY BOOKS IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY THEY ARE EXPENSIVE AND IF YOU WANT TO STAY LEGAL AND DON'T WANT TO JUST DOWNLOAD THEM ILLEGAL YOUR UNIVERSITY WILL HAVE A BIG SELECTION OF BOOKS IN THEIR LIBRARY ONCE YOU'VE FINISHED YOUR BACHELOR YOU CAN THINK ABOUT BUYING A FEW BOOKS THAT YOU NEED FOR YOUR SPECIFIC FIELD OF INTEREST

PHYSICS IS HARD IT'S DOABLE AND EVERYONE THAT I KNOW WHO HAS PUT THE TIME IN MANAGED TO GET HIS DEGREE BUT YOU'LL NEED TO BE WILLING TO SACRIFICE A LOT OF FREE TIME TO STUDY IF YOU WANT TO FINISH YOUR DEGREE YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A GENIUS BUT YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO WORK HARD MOST OUR SUMMERS WERE SPENT STUDYING INSIDE THE PHYSICS DEPARTMENT LOOKING AT THE HUMANITIES STUDENTS ENJOYING THE SUN IN THE PARK OUTSIDE
YOU CAN FIND ALL YOUR ANSWERS HERE
ALREADY BEEN SAID BUT GO WITH THE LINUX WINDOWS DUAL BOOT OVER TIME YOU'LL PROBABLY FIND YOURSELF USING LINUX MORE THAN WINDOWS
HONESTLY GETTING PROGRAMS AND A DEV ENVIRONMENT WORKING ON OS X IS A LOT SIMPLER THEN ON WINDOWS AS CODE WILL GIVE YOU ACCESS TO THE COMPILER AND A VERY NICE TERMINAL WITH BASH SUPPORT WHAT WAS YOUR PROBLEM WITH IT ALSO A LOT OF SOFTWARE FOR HEP IS MADE TO RUN ON LINUX AND THUS GETTING IT WORKING ON OS X IS VERY SIMPLE AND NORMALLY DOESNT REQUIRE ANY CHANGES

IF YOU ARE DEAD SET ON NOT GETTING A OS X LAPTOP WHICH ISNT A BAD THING I WOULD DO WHAT U GINNUNGAGAP SUGGESTED AND DUAL BOOT WITH LINUX I'VE NEVER HAD ACCESS TO A LARGE COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT THAT RAN WINDOWS SO I THINK THAT USING A PURE WINDOWS SYSTEM WOULD BE A DRAW BACK IF NOTHING MORE THEN JUST FOR THE LACK OF A GOOD TERMINAL THOUGH YOU COULD INSTALL CYGWIN ON ONE AND GET MOST OF THE LINUX ENVIROMENT YOU WOULD NEED

OVERALL IF YOU HAVE A WORKING PRO I DONT THINK YOU NEED TO SPEND MONEY ON A NEW ONE LEARN HOW TO USE WHAT YOU HAVE AND IT SHOULD LAST YOU A LONG TIME
IF YOU'RE A GAMER THEN I'D MAYBE LOOK INTO SETTING UP A DUAL BOOT WITH WINDOWS AND LINUX THAT WOULD GIVE YOU THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS AND FROM A CODING STANDPOINT MACS ARE VERY SIMILAR TO LINUX UBUNTU IS A GOOD PLACE TO START THERE ARE PLENTY OF GUIDES FOR GETTING SET UP WITH DUAL BOOT AND IT'S NOT HARD TO DO AND BESIDES LEARNING LINUX NOW WILL HELP YOU LATER ON IN THEORY
I'M ALSO IN THE SAME BOAT IN YOU JUST A TIER HIGHER I'VE USED FEDORA AND CENTOS FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF NOW AND DECIDED TO DELVE INTO ARCH LINUX FIRST YEAR IN UNDERGRAD PHYSICS AND MANAGED TO SET UP MY ARCH INSTALL TODAY
LINUX IS SIMPLER TO USE AS A DEVELOPING ENVIRONMENT AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ANY LEGAL ISSUES WHEN DISTRIBUTING CODE PACKAGED WITH THE GNU SCIENTIFIC LIBRARY AND OTHER TOOLS LIKE ROOT
I STILL AM FORCED TO USE WINDOWS WHEN AT SCHOOL TIMES NEW ROMAN POINT FONT AND PROPITIATORY APPS LIKE SNAP AND I'VE NEVER TOUCHED A MAC IN MY LIFE I'VE HEARD IT IS SIMILAR TO BSD SO IT HAS SIMILAR COMMANDS TO LINUX
YOU'LL GET MUCH BETTER SPECIFICATIONS IF YOU GET A LAPTOP PAY FOR HIGH END HARDWARE NOT BRAND USUALLY WHEN ASKED ABOUT MACHINE TO DO COMPUTING I'LL SAY BETTER GET A TOP DESKTOP BUT IF YOUR FOCUS IS PORTABILITY THAN GO WITH A LAPTOP

ALSO USE LINUX WINDOWS IS PRETTY CUMBERSOME TO DO ANYTHING ACADEMIC OR PROGRAMMING RELATED
MULTIPLE OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE DEPENDING ON YOUR NEEDS AND HOW MUCH SETUP AND TINKERING YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH INCLUDING

DUAL BOOT A LINUX BISTRO AND WINDOWS AS HAS ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED

2 INSTALL A LINUX BISTRO IN A VIRTUAL MACHINE USING THE FREE VIRTUALBOX OR VMWARE PLAYER PROBABLY ONLY PRACTICAL IF YOUR LAPTOP HAS AT LEAST GB RAM

USE THE AVAILABLE BUILT-IN BASH SHELL COMMAND LINE ONLY OPTION IN WINDOWS SEE THE WINDOWS SUBSYSTEM FOR LINUX FAQ ALSO SEE THIS

USE A DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT SUCH AS CODI CODEANYWHERE CODENVY CLOUD ETC SOME OF THESE CAN BE INTEGRATED WITH GITHUB OR BITBUCKET ONLINE SOURCE CODE REPOSITORIES

USE MATH PROGRAMMING TOOLS OFTEN USED IN COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS

DUAL BOOT CLOUDREADY CHROME OS HTTPS SOME PEOPLE USE THIS FOR DEVELOPMENT THOUGH I CONSIDER IT A VERY LIMITED ENVIRONMENT COMPARED TO A FULL LINUX BISTRO INSTALL YOU CAN ALSO INSTALL CLOUDREADY IN A VM THOUGH THE SCREEN RESOLUTION WILL BE LIMITED TO

IF YOU NEED A LOCAL WEB SERVER ON YOUR WINDOWS MACHINE WAMP AND XAMPP ARE AVAILABLE SIMILAR SOFTWARE STACKS ARE AVAILABLE FOR LINUX SUCH AS LAMP VISUAL STUDIO COMMUNITY SUITE IS FREELY AVAILABLE FOR WINDOWS LINUX MAC AND I BELIEVE ANDROID AS WELL

THERE MAY ALSO BE OTHER OPTIONS BUT THESE ARE ONES I KNOW ABOUT
HONESTLY I'D GO WITH A CHROMEBOOK GALLIUMS AND IF YOU NEED EXTRA SPACE AN EXTERNAL HARD-DRIVEN

THAT IS UNLESS YOU HAVE A RIDICULOUS AMOUNT OF DISPOSABLE INCOME
A BIT LATE TO THIS THREAD BUT HERE'S WHAT I'D RECOMMEND I'M A PHD STUDENT THAT DOES HIGHLY PARALLEL SIMULATIONS

AS LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE ARE SAYING LINUX IS THE WAY TO GO UNLESS YOU WANT TO GAME ON THE LAPTOP I WOULDN'T EVEN BOTHER WITH DUAL BOOTING WINDOWS

IF YOU WANT TO USE A MAC GET FAMILIAR WITH THINGS LIKE HOMEBREW WHICH BASICALLY ADDS PACKAGE MANAGEMENT

YOU DON'T NEED SUPER HARDWARE IF YOU NEED TO DO EXTENSIVE PARALLEL NUMERICAL WORK YOU'LL ALMOST ALWAYS HAVE A SERVER CLUSTER ETC YOU TSH INTO AND RUN JOBS ON

SOME MAKES MODELS I WOULD CONSIDER DELL APS GREAT BATTERY LIFE AND VERY PORTABLE BUT SCREEN IS HONESTLY A BIT SMALL FOR PROGRAMMING IMO DELL LATITUDE SERIES I GOT A LATITUDE AT A REALLY GOOD PRICE AND LIKE IT QUITE A BIT THINKPAD CARBON SUPER PORTABLE AND LIGHT BUT PRICEY THINKPAD T SERIES WORKHORSE BUSINESS CLASS MACHINES
MAYBE THERE ARE SOME THINGS YOU WANT TO HAVE A LOOK FOR WHILE BUYING A LAPTOP THAT IS SUPPOSED TO LAST LIKE TO YEARS

OS I LIKE UBUNTU MAYBE GETTING ANOTHER THEN UNITY ALSO IT WILL GET YOU A BIT INTO BASH AND USING A SHELL ALSO IT IS LIKE THE TO GO OS FOR MOST COMPUTERS IN OUR UNIVERSITY OF COLOGNE MOREOVER UBUNTU FEELS LIKE YOU CAN'T DESTROY IT BY REGULAR USE SAYING THAT WINDOWS MIGHT WORK AS WELL IF YOU ARE A BIT CAUTIOUS ABOUT WHAT YOU INSTALL

RAM IF YOU ARE ABLE TO EXTEND IT BY YOURSELF GO FOR IT 2 IS A BIG DEAL IN FELT SPEED
CPU TRY GETTING A LAPTOP WITH A CPU OF THE LATEST SERIES MEANING THE ARCHITECTURE
GRAPHIC CARD SOUNDS NOT LIKE A BIG DEAL FOR WHAT YOU WANT BUT STILL IT IS NICE TO HAVE IF YOU EVER WANNA PLAY WITH THAT THING

HAPTICAL FEELING IF YOUR MACHINE HAS THE POWER IT NEEDS IT COMES MAINLY DOWN TO HOW IT FEELS ONLY SOLUTION I HAVE FOR YOU IS GO INTO A STORE TOUCH MACHINES AND TYPE ON THEM

ONLY SPEAKING FOR ME I LIKE THE IDEA OF HAVING A CONVERTABLE RENOVO THINKPAD X YOGA
SINCE THOSE GET ME AWAY FROM CLASSICAL PEN AND PAPER WHILE LISTENING A LECTURE HAVING STUFF YOU DID WRITE SYNCED WITH A CLOUD MAKES HANDLING THE CHAOS OF NOTES LESS BIG OF A DEAL

GNU LINUX IS THE BEST CHOICE IN MY HUMBLE OPINION
AFTER ALL THE COMMENTS ON HERE IM STICKING WITH MY MATCHBOOK PRO AND IM GOING TO TRY OUT LINUX ON A MEMORY STICK FIRST THEN ILL PUT IT ON A PARTITION ON MY PC THEN MAYBE ONE DAY REPLACE OS X WITH IT
I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT MOST COSMOLOGISTS BASED ON THEORY AND STRONG OBSERVATIONAL EVIDENCE ACCEPT A STANDARD COSMOLOGICAL MODEL WHERE THE DENSITY OF DARK ENERGY AMOUNT OF ENERGY PER UNIT VOLUME OF SPACE IS CONSTANT DARK ENERGY COULD BE CONSIDERED TO BE THE ENERGY OF EMPTY SPACE OR VACUUM ENERGY AND BASICALLY ACTS AS THE COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT IN FIELD EQUATIONS OF GENERAL RELATIVITY

DARK ENERGY IS SMOOTHLY DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT SPACE AND PERSISTENT SO AS SPACE EXPANDS DARK ENERGY DENSITY DOES NOT DILUTE AWAY AS BOTH MATTER AND RADIATION DENSITY DOES A HELPFUL REFERENCE EXPLAINING MORE ABOUT THIS

THERE ARE OTHER MODELS THAT POSIT DARK ENERGY AS DYNAMICAL SLOWLY CHANGING OVER TIME SUCH AS QUINTESSENCE BUT THE LEADING MODEL MENTIONED ABOVE SUGGESTS IT IS CONSTANT

THANKYOU FOR THE INFO

YEAH BARRING SOME STRANGE EFFECT YOU SHOULD BE RIGHT THE FAN DEAL WOULD ONLY WORK FOR THE THERMOSTAT AND THE OBJECT BEING OUT OF THERMODYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUM OR EVAPORATIVE COOLING LIKE ON OUR SKIN
IT MIGHT TURN ON A FEW SECONDS FASTER THE FIRST TIME IF THERE ARE COOL SPOTS IN YOUR PLACE BUT ON AVERAGE IT COMES ON JUST AS MUCH MIGHT AS WELL JUST TURN IT UP A NOTCH
PUT ICE NEAR THE FAN SO IT IS ACTUALLY BLOWING COOL AIR
GENERALLY YOU'RE RIGHT ASK YOUR BUDDY WHAT HE THINKS THE AIR TEMPERATURE FROM THE AIR EMITTED BY THE FAN WOULD BE IT JUST SUCKS IN AIR FROM THE BACK OF THE FAN AND PUSHES IT FORWARD TOWARDS THE THERMOSTAT
MOVING AIR HAS HIGHER CONV HEAT TRANSF COEFF
THE REAL ANSWER IS IT DEPENDS ON HOW THE THERMOSTAT WORKS IF THE THERMOSTAT PRODUCED ANY HEAT THEN YOUR BUDDY WOULD BE RIGHT IN REALITY OF THERMOSTATS ARE SOME KIND OF PASSIVE RESISTER THAT DON'T HEAT SO YOU WOULD BE RIGHT ALSO MOST MODERN THERMOSTATS DON'T ACTUALLY USE A SINGLE SET POINT THEY HAVE A RANGE OF ACCEPTABLE TEMPERATURES AND ACTUALLY HAVE A MEMORY THAT PREVENTS THEM FROM OSCILLATING BETWEEN ON AND OFF NEAR A TRANSITION
THAT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY SINCE AIR FLOWS INSIDE BUILDINGS CAN BE QUITE COMPLEX IN GENERAL A ROOM IS NOT THE SAME TEMPERATURE EVERYWHERE THERE WILL BE HOT SPOTS NEAR SOURCES OF HEAT HEATERS WINDOWS IN SUMMER BACK END OF A FRIDGE AND COLD SPOTS NEAR SINKS DOORS AND WINDOWS IN WINTER ATTICS AND CELLARS IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE IS CONSTANT CONVECTION CAUSED BY WARM AIR RISING TO THE CEILING AND ESCAPING THERE OR TRANSFERING IT'S HEAT TO THE CEILING SO IN SHORT IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHERE THE THERMOSTAT IS LOCATED AND WHAT DIRECTION THE FAN IS BLOWING AS WELL AS THE DETAILS OF YOUR ROOM
WELL ASSUMING THE KERR METRIC HOLDS ITS LIKELY THAT SOME PROCESS WOULD INTERVENE TO RADIATE OR REJECT ROTATIONAL ENERGY BEFORE YOU COULD GET THE ANGULAR MOMENTUM J LARGER THAN GM 2 OBV USING GR UNITS C I SAY THAT BECAUSE AT THAT POINT THE SINGULARITY WOULD BECOME NAKED WHICH PROBABLY ISN'T ALLOWED IN OUR UNIVERSE ALTHOUGH THAT IS TOTALLY SPECULATION

SO TO SOLVE FOR THAT J FIGURE OUT WHAT YOUR M IS SUCH THAT THE CIRCUMFERENCE IS A LIGHT MINUTE I DIDN'T DO THAT FOR YOU B C I'M PRETTY SURE THE EVENT HORIZON OF A KERR BLACK HOLE ISN'T NECESSARILY SPHERICAL SURELY THE BOUNDARY TO THE ERGOSPHERE ISN'T AND I THINK ITS A LOT EASIER TO DEFINE A BLOCKHOLE BY ITS MASS THAN THE CIRCUMFERENCE I'M ALSO JUST NOT FAMILIAR ENOUGH WITH THE KERR METRIC TO BE CONFIDENT IN AN ANSWER

ALSO J IS ALMOST CERTAINLY GOING TO BE EASIER TO WORK WITH THAN I'M PRETTY SURE THAT THE RPM UPPER LIMIT WOULD BE A FUNCTION OF THE MASS SO IS THE THEORETICAL LIMIT ON J AND YOU'D HAVE TO BE CAREFUL TO DEFINE ACCORDING TO WHOM YOU ARE MEASURING THE SINCE A FEATURE OF THE KERR METRIC IS THAT THE TIME AND ANGULAR COORDINATE GET MIXED UP AND THAT EFFECT WILL VARY DEPENDING ON HOW FAR AWAY YOU ARE AN INFINITELY FAR AWAY OBSERVER WOULD PROBABLY WORK TO CALCULATE THAT
A PHYSICIST TOLD ME THAT THE COLLIDING PHOTONS MUST BE TRAVELING EXACTLY IN OPPOSITE VELOCITIES FOR PRODUCTION OF MASSIVE PARTICLES HOWEVER HE DID NOT EXPLAIN WHY IS THIS CLAIM TRUE IF SO WHAT IS THE REASONING

IT CAN'T BE TRUE BECAUSE THAT'S NOT A STATEMENT IN ORDER FOR PAIR PRODUCTION TO OCCUR IN A PHOTON SYSTEM THE BARE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT IS THAT THE INVARIANT MASS OF THE SYSTEM EXCEEDS THE REST MASSES OF THE PARTICLES YOU WISH TO CREATE THERE CAN BE ADDITIONAL CONSTRAINTS BASED ON ANGULAR MOMENTUM AND THE PROBABILITY OF THE REACTION MIGHT BE VERY LOW UNTIL THE CENTER OF MASS ENERGY IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE SUM OF THEIR REST MASSES BUT ANYWAY AT A BARE MINIMUM YOU NEED ENOUGH INVARIANT MASS TO PRODUCE THE PARTICLE MASSES A SYSTEM OF TWO PHOTONS HAS NONZERO INVARIANT MASS AS LONG AS THEY'RE NOT MOVING IN EXACTLY THE SAME DIRECTION IF THE PHOTONS ARE MOVING IN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS THE SYSTEM HAS SOME MASSACHUSETTS FOR GIVEN PHOTON ENERGIES THE INVARIANT MASS IS MAXIMIZED WHEN THEY'RE MOVING IN EXACTLY OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS SO IT'S NOT TRUE THAT THEY NEED TO BE MOVING IN EXACTLY OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS BUT THAT'S HOW YOU GET THE MOST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK

IT SEEMS REASONABLE THAT A SINGLE PHOTON TRAVELING ALONE IN SPACE COULD NEVER PRODUCE PARTICLES BY PAIR PRODUCTION SINCE THAT WOULD VIOLATE CONSERVATION OF MOMENTUM

CORRECT
YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN THIS RECENT PRELIMINARY RESULT FROM ATLAS WHERE THEY SEE EVIDENCE FOR SCATTERING THE DIPHOTON EPEUS EPMINUS IS CHANNEL IS DISCUSSED HERE AS A BACKGROUND

IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT INSTEAD OF USING STRONG LASERS HERE THEY ARE USING THE EM FIELDS PRODUCED BY LEAD ION BEAMS THE LEAD IONS DON'T HIT EACH OTHER BUT THE EM FIELDS INTERACT TO PRODUCE OTHER STUFF ADDITIONALLY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN'T BE DONE WITH CONVENTIONAL PROTON BEAMS IN THE LOC BECAUSE THE CROSS SECTION OF THE PROCESS SCALES AS Z SO USING LEAD IONS ENHANCES IT BY A FACTOR OF
WHAT IS THE QUESTION HE'S TRYING TO ANSWER
HAVE YOU GUYS LOOKED INTO WET OR DRY ETCH

CIB WOULD DEFINITELY WORK BUT EQUIPMENT IS COSTLY
HEADPHONES

UNLESS HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE BANGING ON THE KEYS THEN YOU JUST NEED EARTHQUAKE PADS FOR THE STAND TABLE OR WHATEVER YOU HAVE IT SITTING ON
DON'T PLAY FOR A WEEK AND OTHERWISE KEEP YOUR NOISE TO A MINIMUM AND SEE IF THE GUY STILL COMPLAINS

THE PEOPLE SUGGESTING HEADPHONES ARE PROBABLY RIGHT BUT I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR PEOPLE BECOMING HYPERSENSITIVE TO ANY NOISE ONCE SOMETHING SETS THEM OFFICIAL NOT PLAYING FOR A WEEK WOULD LET YOU SEE IF THE PERSON IS ACTUALLY RESPONDING TO YOUR NOISE OR HAS JUST BEEN TRIGGERED BY HAVING HEARD YOU ONCE AND NOW ATTRIBUTING ANY AND ALL NOISE TO YOU IT'S WORTH KNOWING IF YOU'RE JUST FACING AN UNWINNABLE BATTLE BEFORE YOU START BENDING OVER BACKWARD TRYING TO BE REASONABLE ABOUT THIS
ACOUSTICS IS TRICKY ASIDE FROM HEADPHONES YOU CAN TRY DECOUPLING THE SPEAKER AND OR THE KEYBOARD FROM ANY HARD SURFACES THAT COULD BE COMMUNICATING THE SOUND TO THE STRUCTURE OF THE BUILDING SO PUTTING SHAG CARPETING REMNANTS UNDER THE KEYBOARD STAND AND SPEAKER

IF THAT HELPS BUT ISN'T ENOUGH MAYBE YOUR NEIGHBOR WILL SPLIT THE COST OF FANCY RUBBER
TRY PADDING IT GO UPSTAIRS GET HIS NUMBER GO BACK DOWNSTAIRS CALL HIM TEST IT YOU KNOW BASIC HUMAN INTERACTION
WHY IS THIS IN R PHYSICS
STEP GO TALK TO HIM

STEP 2 WEAR HEADPHONES WHEN YOU PLAY SEE IF THAT DISTURBS HIM IF IT DOES THE PROBLEM IS YOU BANGING ON THE KEYS AND THE SOLUTION TO THAT MAY BE AS SIMPLE AS MOVING THE KEYBOARD TO A DIFFERENT SPOT OR ADDING SOME PADDING OR SOMETHING IF IT DOESN'T THE PROBLEM IS THE SOUND

STEP IF IT'S THE SOUND JUST WEAR HEADPHONES WHEN YOU PLAY AT NIGHT TO ACTUALLY SOLVE THE PROBLEM THOUGH IF THE PROBLEM IS A VIBRATION THEN MAYBE YOU'RE USING A SPEAKER WITH TOO MUCH BASS TURN THAT SHIT DOWN

I USED TO PLAY DDR IT WAS PROBABLY PRETTY ANNOYING TO THE NEIGHBORS DOWNSTAIRS YOU KNOW WHAT I DID I KNOCKED ON THEIR DOOR AND EXPLAINED THAT I WAS GOING TO BE PLAYING DDR AND I'D STICK TO REASONABLE TIMES AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO STOP IF THERE WAS A PROBLEM JUST DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT MAYBE
EITHER THICK PADDING RUBBER FEET OR PYRAMID POINTED FEET ALSO MAKE SURE ITS NOT VIBRATING AGAINST THE WALL
THANK YOU FOR BEING RESPECTFUL OF YOUR NEIGHBOR YOU SEEM TO BE IN A VERY TINY MINORITY OF PEOPLE
HEADPHONES YOU'LL GET BETTER SOUND QUALITY THAN FROM A SMALL SPEAKER IN ANY CASE I DO THIS WITH MY EX CHURCH ORGAN
I'D SAY PAD THE SPEAKER TO MUFFLE THE BASE OR MOVE YOUR KEYBOARD TO A DIFFERENT PART OF THE APARTMENT
THE PROBLEM MIGHT NOT BE THE PIANO MUSIC IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE BUILDING HAS A RESONANT FREQUENCY THAT CAUSES HIS FLOOR TO BOUNCE UP AND DOWN WITH YOUR SWAYING POUNDING TAPPING AND PEDAL MOTIONS
DECOUPLE FROM FLOOR BY PUTTING A CARPET UNDERNEATH IF YOUR KEYBOARD HAS HOLLOW METAL LEGS YOU CAN ALSO FILL WITH FINE SAND THE FRICTION ABSORBS THE ACOUSTIC ENERGY
YOUR PHONE LIKELY HAS A MOTION SENSOR THAT WILL WORK WITH A VIBRATION SENSOR APPARENTLY TELL YOUR NEIGHBOR YOU ARE WORKING ON A SOLUTION TAKE YOUR PHONE IN HIS SPACE PUT ON THE SUPPOSEDLY VIBRATING SURFACE AND HAVE A FRIEND OR SOMEONE PLAY YOUR KEYBOARD THAT'S YOUR BASELINE
NOW HAVE A FRIEND PUT A TOWEL UNDERNEATH THE SPEAKER TO SIMULATE RUBBER PADDING SEE IF IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE TO THE READINGS
RUBBER FOAM SHEETS STACKED UP WORK WELL DEFINITELY COLLABORATE WITH THE NEIGHBOR IF POSSIBLE I'VE LIVED BELOW A SUBWOOFER OWNER BEFORE AND EXPERIENCED THIS ISSUE IT WAS FAR WORSE THAN EXPECTED TRY KITCHEN DRAWER LINER MATERIAL FOR A CHEAP SOLUTION CORK BOARD WORKS TOO
HIGH-PASS FILTER SET AT HZ ATH NO RESONANCE
IN THE OLDEN DAYS PEOPLE WOULD REST THEIR SPEAKERS ON A PHONE BOOK
GO GRAB LIKE TOWELS AND FOLD THEM PLACE THEM UNDER YOUR SPEAKER IT SHOULD DAMPEN THE VIBRATIONS ENOUGH WITHOUT EFFECTING THE VOLUME
DID ANYONE SAY HEADPHONES YET
YES VERY CHEAP SOLUTION EXPLAIN TO THE LANDLORD OR TO THE NEIGHBOR IF HE TALKS TO YOU THAT HIS DEMANDS ARE UNREASONABLE AND HIS SENSITIVITY TO NOISE IS INCONGRUENT WITH HIS DESIRE TO LIVE IN AN APARTMENT COMPLEX HE CAN PURCHASE AND APPLY SOUND DAMPENING MATERIAL TO HIS BEDROOM WHICH WILL HELP KEEP NOISE FROM ALL SOURCES TO A MINIMUM BE THEY FROM HIS OWN APARTMENT HIS NEIGHBORS ANIMALS INSECTS AND ROAD NOISES
MOVE TO A HOUSE

COMPUTING THE LANDING PROBABILITY FOR A POLYHEDRON IS ESSENTIALLY HOPELESS THERE IS NO WAY THAT RESULT IS EXACT IN GENERAL SOME APPROXIMATIONS HAVE SURELY BEEN MADE I RECKON SOMETHING CAN BE DONE WITH SOME ERGODICITY HYPOTHESES WITH THIS COMBINED WITH THE FACT THERE IS NO SOURCE THE FORMULA IS PRETTY MUCH USELESS

NOTE YOU WILL BE TOLD THE PROBABILITY OF LANDING ON A FACE IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE AREA OF THE FACE OR THE SOLID ANGLE OR WHATEVER IT'S OBVIOUSLY FALSE HERE'S A COUNTEREXAMPLE TAKE A DIE IN THE SHAPE OF A TRUNCATED PYRAMID WITH THE PYRAMID STEEP AND SHORT ENOUGH THAT THE DIE CANNOT STAND ON ONE OF THE SIDE FACES THEN THE PROBABILITY TO LAND ON THOSE IS ALWAYS ZERO

EDIT JUST AS A CUTE ADDITION THE DUAL POLYHEDRA TO THOSE WOULD MAKE FAIR DICE THE DUAL OF AN ARCHIMEDEAN SOLID IS A ATAL POLYHEDRON WHICH HAS IRREGULAR BUT EQUAL FACES OF THE CATALAN SOLIDS MAKE FOR FAIR DICE PROBABILITY NUMBER OF FACES

EDIT 2 SORRY THE DUAL TO THE SNUB DODECAHEDRON IS ONE OF THE TWO THAT IS NOT FAIR BUT THE DUAL TO THE ROMBICOSIDODECAHEDRON IS FINE ALONG WITH OTHER CATALAN SOLIDS
THE CONCEPT OF STERADIAN SPHERICAL RADIAN WILL BE HELPFUL HERE AS THE PROBABILITY OF LANDING ON A SIDE SHOULD BE PROPORTIONAL TO THE STERADIAN OCCUPIED BY THAT SIDE OVER OF THE TOTAL SPHERE

YOU WILL NEED TO DEFINE A SPHERE THAT IS POSITIONED ON THE CENTRE OF MASS WITH A RADIUS TO THE LOWEST SURFACE POINT SIDE WITH THE LOWEST ENERGY LEVEL

TO CALCULATE THE STERADIAN FOR A SIDE YOU NEED TO PROJECT THE AREA OF THE SIDE ONTO A SPHERE AT THE LOWEST ENERGY LEVEL IF TWO SIDES PROJECT TO THE SAME POINT ON THE SPHERE THE LOWEST ENERGY LEVEL WINS

STERADIAN OF ONE SIDE A R 2

WHERE
A IS THE AREA OF THE SPHERE COVERED
R IS THE RADIUS OF THE SPHERE

EDIT
GETTING DOWN VOTES AND REALIZED THAT I MISSED AN IMPORTANT ASPECT THE OTHER THING TO THINK ABOUT IS THE MINIMUM ENERGY STATE A COIN WILL NEVER LAND ON ITS SIDE BECAUSE FLAT IS A LOWER ENERGY STATE SO THIS NEEDED TO BE CONSIDERED
IF YOU HAVEN'T HAD VECTOR CALC AND SPECIAL RELATIVITY YET MY ADVICE WOULD BE TO JUST WAIT UNTIL YOU HAVE GR IS A DEEP AND DIFFICULT SUBJECT AND WON'T BENEFIT YOU IN ANY OF YOUR CLASSES TO KNOW I WOULD SAY JUST WAIT A YEAR OR TWO AS YOUR TIME WOULD BE BETTER SPENT UNDERSTANDING YOUR BASICS LOWER DIV MATERIAL THAN STRUGGLING ON ADVANCED TOPICS WITHOUT A PROPER FOUNDATION CHEERS
I WAS IN YOUR POSITION JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO HERE'S WHAT I DID

START WITH A MECHANICS COURSE IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY IT'S CRUCIAL THAT YOU HAVE A SOLID UNDERSTANDING OF PHYSICS BEFORE YOU TRY TO LEARN THE ADVANCED STUFF

LEARN CALC ALL THE WAY THROUGH VECTOR CALCULUS A GREAT RESOURCE FOR THIS IS PROFESSOR LEONARD THIS IS CALC BUT HE HAS ALL OF THEM

HERE'S WHERE I LEARNED PHYSICS ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM I ALSO LEARNED SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND BASIC QUANTUM MECHANICS AT THIS POINT QM IS OPTIONAL BUT FUN

I LEARNED LINEAR ALGEBRA AND DIFF EAS AT THIS POINT I USED KHAN ACADEMY FOR THIS THOUGH I'M NOT SURE IT'S THE BEST RESOURCE OUT THERE

NEXT I WOULD RECOMMEND TRYING TO TAKE A CLASS ON MATHEMATICAL PROOFS WHEN YOU ARE READING PAPERS RATHER THAN WATCHING VIDEOS YOU WILL APPRECIATE IT I WATCHED THIS SERIES BECAUSE I'M A COMP SCI MAJOR BUT IF YOU AREN'T A COMP SCI PERSON JUST LOOK FOR A METHODS OF PROOFS CLASSICAL

NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE FUN STUFF

TENSOR CALCULUS IS WHAT GENERAL RELATIVITY IS FOUNDED ON I FOUND THIS SERIES TO BE HELPFUL

SO NOW IT'S TIME TO GET INTO GRAMMAR

THIS SERIES FROM PBS SPACE TIME IS A GREAT INTRODUCTION INTO ACCURATE GRAMMAR THEIR OTHER STUFF IS GREAT TOO

THIS VIDEO FROM DRPHYSICSA STEPS THROUGH THE THOUGHTS BEHIND EACH PART OF THE EDES AND IS NOT THE BEST VIDEO BUT IT HELPED ME

AND THAT'S WHERE I COULDN'T FIND ANY MORE VIDEOS SO I USED SOME TEXT RESOURCES

THE BOOK GRAVITATION IS THE MOST COMMONLY USED TEXTBOOK FOR GR AS FAR AS I KNOW

I FOUND THIS ARTICLE ON WIKIPEDIA TO BE ENORMOUSLY HELPFUL IN UNDERSTANDING HOW TO WORK A GENERAL RELATIVITY PROBLEM IT TOOK ME A FEW TIMES GOING THROUGH IT TO FOLLOW IT ALL THE WAY BUT IT IS GREAT

WHERE YOU GO AFTER THIS REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO WITH GR PERSONALLY I FIND THEORY TO BE VERY INTRIGUING AND THAT LEADS DOWN THE ROAD TO STRING THEORY

GOOD LUCK
I'D RECOMMEND GETTING THROUGH VECTOR CALCULUS FIRST AS YOU'D LEARN IN E MASCULINE
READ ORIGINAL PAPERS MUCH WILL BE DIFFICULT DON'T EXPECT TO INGEST IT ALL BUT THEY ARE REMARKABLY SHORT THEY ARE REMARKABLY CLEAR AND THEY WILL GET YOU HOOKED FOR ALL THE REST OF THE DUE DILIGENCE THE REST HERE ARE SUGGESTING TAKE A NICE SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND JUST READ THROUGH THEM EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT QUITE YET EQUIPPED IT IS WORTH THE EXPERIENCE FOR THE RELATIVELY SMALL AMOUNT OF TIME IT WILL TAKE

YOU'RE LUCKY IN MOST FIELDS THE PRIMARY PAPERS ARE NOT APPROACHABLE AT ALL BUT THERE IS MUCH TO BE GOTTEN FROM THE THINKING TAKING PLACE IN WRITINGS
IM NO EXPERT BUT AS AN UNDERGRAD I WAS HAVING TROUBLE WITH GENERAL RELATIVITY AT FIRST BECAUSE I HADNT HAD THE PREREQUISITE MATHS YET WHAT WAS REALLY HELPFUL FOR ME WAS YOUTUBE VIDEOS ON TENSOR CALCULUS THIS IS YEARS AGO BUT I THINK I USED KAHN ACADEMY AFTER THAT IT WAS JUST WORKING THROUGH THE TWO HALVES OF THE EINSTEIN FIELD EQUATION UNDER DIFFERENT CONDITIONS AND KEEPING TRACK OF INDICES
I THINK BOOK IS THE ONE FOR YOU BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE WRITTEN
YOU HAVE TO START SOMEWHERE SO START SLOW START AT A WALK AND THEN GO TO A CAR OR A BUS AND START DRIVING THERE YOU'RE MOVING FASTER THAT'S GOOD THEN DRIVE TO THE AIRPORT AND GET IN AIRPLANE NOW YOU'RE GOING REALLY FAST NOW TAKE THAT PLANE TO FLORIDA AND TRY TO GET A SPOT IN A SPACE MISSION THAT'S A BIT TRICKY BUT IT IS POSSIBLE NOW YOU ARE REALLY ACCELERATING GOOD JOB WITH A LITTLE MORE WORK I'LL JUST LEAVE THIS PART AS AN EXERCISE TO THE READER YOU CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO TRAVEL AT ABOUT C OR SO AND YOU'LL BE REALLY GETTING INTO GENERAL RELATIVITY

I'D SAY GOOD LUCK AND SEE YOU WHEN YOU GET BACK BUT I'LL BE DEAD
YOU CAN JUST READ A FIRST COURSE IN GENERAL RELATIVITY BY SCHUTZ YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW MUCH CALCULUS LINEAR ALGEBRA IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT SPECIAL RELATIVITY IS NOT SO COMPLICATED YOU NEED TO LEARN IT ELSEWHERE FIRST
TEXTBOOK IS VERY UNDERGRADUATE FRIENDLY PHYSICS FIRST MATH LATER THOUGH YOU'LL STILL NEED TO KNOW SOME
IN ADDITION TO THE GOOD TIPS YOU'LL GET HERE CHECK OUT THIS THREAD WHICH ARE ANSWERS TO A SIMILAR QUESTION AS YOURS AND ALSO AT SOME POINT IN YOUR LEARNING I RECOMMEND THIS GENERAL OVERVIEW AS SUPPLEMENTAL READING
IF YOU SHOULD CARE TO FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF SO EARLY ON READ ABOUT NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRY PROBLEMS LIKE EMBEDDING THE SPHERICAL GEOMETRY ONTO THE PLANE THESE MATHEMATICS BEGAN WHAT BECAME GENERAL RELATIVITY OTHERWISE JUST FOLLOW YOUR UNIVERSITY'S SUGGESTED OUTLINE UNTIL GR OPENS UP FOR YOU
A ABSTRACT ALGEBRA COURSE HELPED ME A LITTLE FOR GR MORE FOR QUANTUM BUT I WOULD RECOMMEND ABSTRACT ALGEBRA FOR PRETTY MUCH ALL PHYSICS UNDERGRADS
I DON'T HAVE ANY VERIFICATION FOR WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY SO TRUST THIS AS YOU WISH


BUT I TOOK AN INTRODUCTION TO RELATIVITY COURSE AND TENSORS WERE NOT REALLY THE BIG ISSUE SO MUCH THE ISSUE IN UNDERSTANDING EXACTLY WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WAS UNDERSTANDING DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY TERMS THINGS LIKE THE CONCEPTUAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RIEMANN RICCI AND SCALAR CURVATURES MAYBE IT WAS JUST THE PROFESSOR

MY POINT IS LOOK FOR A DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY BOOK NOT A TENSOR BOOK THE DG BOOK WILL CONTAIN A SECTION ON CERTAIN RULES ABOUT TENSORS WHICH YOU'LL GET THE HANG OF
VIDEO LECTURES ARE PRETTY APPROACHABLE LOTS OF OTHER GREAT COURSES ON THAT SITE TOO
I'M A MASTER STUDENT IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS AS I'VE GONE THROUGH SIMILAR THOUGHTS AS YOU EVEN SINCE I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL MY ADVICE WOULD BE NOT TRY TO TAKE GR SERIOUSLY AT YOUR STAGE IT DOESN'T HURT IF YOU READ AND WATCH SOME ELEMENTARY STUFF LIKE IN MOST OF OPEN COURSES BUT IN MY OPINION IT'S NOT JUST THE MATHS THAT ARE DIFFICULT IT'S ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT LEVEL OF ABSTRACTION IN PHYSICS YOU WOULD DEFINITELY STRUGGLE A LOT WITHOUT A PROPER UNDERSTANDING OF VECTOR CALCULUS AND AN ADVANCED COURSE ON CLASSICAL PHYSICS I EAST LAGRANGIAN HAMILTONIAN FORMALISM AND CLASSICAL FIELD THEORY YOU'D BETTER OFF FOCUS ON WHAT YOU ARE DOING NOW THAN TRYING TO STRETCH TOO MUCH TO GET WHAT YOU ARE NOT READY FOR ALL THE UNDERGRADUATE PHYSICS COURSES ARE GOOD PREPARATION FOR YOU TO BE A BETTER PHYSICS MIND
LEARN VECTOR CALCULUS AND GO THROUGH PAPER EVEN THOUGH THE MATH MAY BE BEYOND SCOPE ABOVE ALL THOUGH LEARN SPECIAL RELATIVITY FIRST THERE ARE PRETTY GREAT RESOURCES OUT THERE MIT'S ONLINE NOTES OR SPECIAL RELATIVITY BY HALLIWELL WHICH I USED IN CLASS AND CHECK OUT YOUTUBE VIDEOS SPECIAL RELATIVITY IS STILL CONCEPTUALLY VERY MUCH A CHALLENGE BUT DEALS WITH MOTION AT HIGH SPEEDS IN THE ABSENCE OF ACCELERATING FRAMES SO IT IS A MUCH SIMPLIFIED VERSION OF GR AND IS NOT AS MATHEMATICALLY CHALLENGING GOOD LUCK OP
NUMBER GET OUT WHILE YOU STILL CAN
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO WITH MATHEMATIC
U SRS
TRY R ASKPHYSICS OR R EXPLAINLIKEIMFIVE THIS ISN'T QUITE THE RIGHT SUBREDDIT FOR SUCH A GENERAL INTRODUCTORY QUESTION
A STRAIGHT FORWARD PROBLEM AND SOLUTION PARTICULARLY SIMPLE ONES
MY SUGGESTION IS TO START BY LOOKING AT A LIST OF PHYSICS PROGRAMS THAT HAVE THE RESEARCH AREA YOURE INTERESTED IN SOLID STATE HEP NUCLEAR ETC ONCE YOU'VE DONE THAT ELIMINATE SCHOOLS YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO OR CAN'T GO TO DUE TO GEOGRAPHICAL REASONS THIS SCHOOL IS TOO FAR FROM MY FAMILY I DON'T REALLY WANT TO LIVE IN DENMARK ETC AFTER THAT START LOOKING AT THE PROFESSORS YOU WANT TO WORK WITH MAKE SURE YOU SEE SEVERAL ISH PEOPLE YOU WANT TO WORK WITH JUST IN CASE FUNDING IS A PROBLEM ONCE YOU'VE DONE THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE A CONCRETE LIST OF SCHOOLS TO PICK AND CHOSE FROM YOU'LL WANT TO SPREAD OUT SCHOOLS BASED ON DIFFICULTY OF BEING ACCEPTED IVE HAD FRIENDS OUTRIGHT NOT GET INTO GRAD SCHOOL BECAUSE THEIR SAFETY SCHOOL WAS YALE
FOR APPLYING START WITH MAKING A LIST START WITH SCHOOLS YOU'VE HEARD OF BY REPUTATION FIGURE OUT WHERE YOUR RESEARCH ADVISORS WENT LOOK UP PAPERS IN YOUR FIELD AND NOTE THE AFFILIATIONS OF THE AUTHORS

FOR EVERY PLACE ON YOUR LIST LOOK AT THE FACULTY MAKE SURE THERE ARE MULTIPLE PEOPLE THERE YOU'D BE FINE WORKING WITH IF YOU CAN'T FIND AT LEAST 2 SUCH PEOPLE DON'T APPLY IF APPLICABLE CHECK TO SEE IF THEY HAVE ACCESS TO COMPUTATIONAL EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONAL FACILITIES YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE
FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU LIKE PLASMA COSMOLOGY BEACHES

2 GO THERE

PROFIT

IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE SCHOOL YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR BUT THE PROF AND RESEARCH GROUP THAT MOST INTERESTS YOU
LOTS OF GOOD THINGS HERE ALREADY BUT AN ADDITIONAL METRIC IF YOU'RE WILLING WANTING TO GO ABROAD FROM WHEREVER YOU LIVE IS WHAT KIND OF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM YOU WANT TO WORK IN SOME PLACES TREAT PHD STUDENTS LIKE EMPLOYEES THEY DON'T TAKE COURSES IT'S FAIRLY THEY GET PAID A SALARY AND HAVE VACATION DAYS ON A STANDARD FIXED CONTRACT IN OTHER PLACES YOU'RE A STUDENT YOU TAKE COURSES YOUR HOURS ARE MORE YOURS TO DETERMINE AND YOU MAY GET PAID BY SOME POSSIBLY VARYING OVER TIME COMBINATION OF STIPENDS GRANTS OR SCHOLARSHIPS IF ONE OR THE OTHER APPROACH APPEALS TO YOU IN PARTICULAR LOOK FOR THAT
WARNING I'M A MATH GRAD STUDENT NOT PHYSICS

HONESTLY I DON'T THINK RESEARCH FIT IS ANYWHERE NEAR AS IMPORTANT AS PEOPLE SAY AS A MATTER OF FACT I THINK IT IS ONE OF THE LEAST IMPORTANT THINGS YOU HAVE A BACHELOR'S YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU WANT TO RESEARCH AND IF YOU DO IT CAN EASILY BE CHANGED RESEARCH IS RESEARCH

THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS ARE YOUR EXPERIENCE AS A STUDENT AND 2 YOUR EXPERIENCE AFTER BEING A STUDENT

SO FIGURE OUT WHAT WILL MAKE YOUR EXPERIENCE AS A STUDENT BEST FOR YOU SOME THINGS TO THINK ABOUT LOCATION UIUC IS A GREAT PROGRAM BUT IS THE MIDDLE OF ILLINOIS REALLY IDEAL HOW DUALS WORK AMOUNT AND TYPE OF FUNDING HOW DO CLASSES WORK ETC

FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENS TO PEOPLE AFTERWARD HOW MANY PEOPLE GRADUATE AND IN HOW LONG WHAT TYPES OF JOBS DO THEY GET

AND ULTIMATELY APPLY TO A BROAD RANGE OF SCHOOLS APPLY TO MIT OR SOMETHING ALSO APPLY TO MIDDLE OF THE ROAD SCHOOLS AND APPLY TO LESSER SCHOOLS AND MAYBE EVEN A MASTERS PROGRAM IT'S UP TO YOU

ALSO ONE MORE THING WITH APPLYING TO GRAD SCHOOLS YOU PROBABLY MEET THE BARE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR GETTING INTO A GRAD SCHOOL YOU PROBABLY WOULD SUCCEED AT ANY SCHOOL EVEN MIT AND PRINCETON ETC BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS NUMBER OF APPLICANTS NUMBER OF SPOTS THEY HAVE TO REJECT SOMEONE THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF LUCK INVOLVED EVEN IF YOU WOULD DO WELL SOMEWHERE THEY MIGHT STILL REJECT YOU BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO REJECT SOMEONE IT'S HARD TO DIFFERENTIATE STUDENTS A GA IS NOT REALLY ANY DIFFERENT THAN A ESPECIALLY FROM DIFFERENT SCHOOLS SO REJECTION OR ACCEPTANCE IF YOU MEET THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS IS JUST ROLLING THE DICE BY BEING A STRONGER CANDIDATE YOU CAN TILT THE ODDS IN YOUR FAVOR BUT STILL THERE IS A STRONG ELEMENT OF CHANCE
I ALSO SUGGEST LOOKING INTO THE LABS THAT ARE ON CAMPUS A SCHOOL WITH MORE BIGGER LABS WILL HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO DO QUALITY RESEARCH THIS ACTUALLY WAS THE DECIDING FACTOR IN THE GRAD SCHOOL I CHOSE
YOUR FIRST STEP IS DEFINITELY TALKING TO YOUR ADVISOR OR SOMEONE IN YOUR DEPARTMENT LIKE REALLY TALK TO THEM ABOUT ALL YOU'RE THINKING AND THEN START DOING IT REGULARLY
I'VE SEEN A LOT OF GOOD COMMENTS ON HERE BUT THERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT I ALSO CONSIDERED WHEN MAKING MY CHOICE FIRST WAS HOW THE DEPARTMENT HANDLED THE ISSUE OF QUALIFYING EXAMS MY STRONG RECOMMENDATION IS TO FOCUS ON SCHOOLS THAT USE CORE GA OR FINAL EXAMS IN THE CORE CLASSES IN PLACE OF TRADITIONAL QUALIFYING EXAMS ADDITIONALLY LOOK AT THE STIPEND VS COST OF LIVING I EAST PER YEAR AT A RURAL SCHOOL GOES FARTHER THAN IN A CITY THIS ALSO HAS THE ADDED BENEFIT OF GIVING YOU AN IDEA OF THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF THE DEPARTMENT IF A DEPARTMENT IS PAYING NOTICEABLY LESS RELATIVE TO SIMILAR SCHOOLS IT'S PROBABLY A RED FLAG IN SHORT THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD PHYSICS GRAD PROGRAMS OUT THERE AND A TON OF DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH TYPE PLACES AS LONG AS THE DEPARTMENT IS LARGE ENOUGH FACULTY GRAD STUDENTS FINANCIALLY STABLE AND HAS FACULTY THAT ARE CONSISTENTLY CONTRIBUTING TO THEIR FIELD YOU'LL DO FINE NO MATTER WHERE YOU END UP
IN NORMAL QM WE THINK OF THINGS BEING FUZZED OUT PARTICLES AREN'T IN JUST ONE PLACE USUALLY THEY ARE KIND OF A MIX OF A LOT OF PLACES WHEN WE MEASURE WHERE THE PARTICLE IS THOUGH IT STOPS BEING FUZZED OUT AND DECIDES ON ONE PLACE TO BE THIS STRANGE PHENOMENON IS WHAT WE CALL WAVEFUNCTION COLLAPSE

IN PILOT WAVE THEORY THE PARTICLES ARE NOT FUZZED OUT THEY ARE ALWAYS IN A PARTICULAR PLACE IN PILOT WAVE THEORY THERE IS NO COLLAPSE BECAUSE THERE IS NOT ANY FUZZINESS TO BEGIN WITH
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN ANY CONCEPT IN QM ACCURATELY WITHOUT MATHEMATICS DO YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE UNDERSTANDING HE MATH
ANY ATOMIC PHYSICS BOOKS THAT ANYONE PARTICULARLY LIKED
MUST HAVE BOOKS FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS IN CONDENSED MATTER THEORY
CAN SOMEONE RECOMMEND ME SOME GOOD BOOKS FOR LOGIC DESIGNING ALSO ANYTHING GOOD FOR A ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATION ENGINEERING STUDENT
ANYONE KNOW OF ANY GOOD BOOKS OR RESOURCES REGARDING FRESNEL AND FRAUNHOFER DIFFRACTION ESPECIALLY CORNU SPIRALS

EDIT I'M AN UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT AND MY PRACTICAL WORK FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS IS BASED ON THIS SO I'M TRYING TO DEVELOP A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING
WHAT'S THE GENERAL OPINION OF AFT BOOKS

GOOD BAD TOO COMPLEX FOR AN INTRODUCTION BUT GOOD AS A REFERENCE THAT MEANS THAT YOU CAN'T READ IT UNLESS YOU ALREADY KNOW A LOT ABOUT THAT SUBJECT AND SO ON
DOING A PROJECT FOR MY INTRO TO E M CLASS ON THE PHOTON AS A FORCE CARRYING PARTICLE ANY POINTERS TO GOOD LITERATURE ON THIS TOPIC
DOES ANYONE KNOW IF THERE IS ANY STANDARD TEXTBOOK FOR INTRODUCTION TO COMPLEX SYSTEMS
I'M AN UNDERGRADUATE STUDYING MATH AS SUCH I AM INTERESTED IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST I READ I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT FIELDS THERE ARE
ANY INTRODUCTORY TEXT FOR SOLID-STATE PHYSICS I FEEL LIKE I'LL NEED TO KNOW THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF SSP FOR MY GRAD SCHOOL FOCUS BUT I DON'T HAVE ROOM LEFT IN MY SCHEDULE TO TAKE A CLASS ON IT WHILE STILL IN UNDERGRAD
I HAVE A TERRIBLE PROBLEM DISCERNING QUESTIONS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S PHYSICALLY HAPPENING AND WHAT FORMULAS TO USE IF THERE'S ANY TEXTBOOK THAT COULD HELP WITH THAT I WOULD APPRECIATE THE ADVICE
HI ALL I'M SWITCHING MAJORS TO MECHANICAL ENGINEERING AND IT'S BEEN 2 YEARS SINCE I'VE TAKEN CALCULUS BASED PHYSICS CAN ANYONE MAKE A RECOMMENDATION FOR A PHYSICS TEXTBOOK THAT WILL REACQUAINT ME WITH THE BASICS OF PHYSICS SPECIFICALLY MECHANICS AND ELECTROMAGNETISM I WAS THINKING ABOUT GETTING THE FEYNMAN LECTURES
ENGINEERING GRAD HERE

I'D LIKE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT QUANTUM MECHANICS ANY BOOKS YOU ALL RECOMMEND
I'M LOOKING FOR AN UNDERGRADUATE QUANTUM MECHANICS TEXTBOOK THAT'S NOT AS ADVANCED AS SHANKAR NOR TOO ELEMENTARY LIKE GRIFFITHS I THINK I'VE NARROWED MY CHOICES TO BINNEY ZETTILI AND MCINTYRE WHICH ONE WOULD YOU RECOMMEND AND WHY
IS THERE A GOOD ONLINE RESOURCE FOR LAW MY GIRLFRIEND HAS A GARBAGE PROFESSOR AND SHE BASICALLY HAS TO LEARN THE COURSE MATERIAL ON HER OWN CURRENTLY SHE IS STUCK WITH LAW AND IS NOT GETTING IT ANY HELP ON A GOOD ONLINE RESOURCE WOULD BE MUCH APPRECIATED THANKS

ANY RESOURCES AND OR TEXTBOOKS YOU'D RECOMMEND TO GET A LITTLE AHEAD AND LEARN MORE ABOUT PARTICLE PHYSICS THERE ARE A COUPLE PROFESSORS HERE I'D LOVE TO WORK WITH BUT I FEEL LIKE I MAY NOT GET THE CHANCE IF I DON'T TRY TO LEARN THINGS ON MY OWN
HI

I WAS STUDDING BARYOGENESIS THIS PAST WEEK AND HAD THE SAME DOMPT AS YOU I FOUND THE FOLLOWING REVIEW TO BE QUITE HELPFUL
ABS
THE WAY THAT YOU ASK DOES NOT MAKE SENSE IN MUCH THE SAME WAY AS CAN A LITRE OF WATER BE REVERSED DOESN'T YOU'RE ASKING CAN ENTROPY DECREASE

NO THE UNIVERSE AND EVERYTHING IN IT IS HEADING TOWARDS A STATE OF MAXIMUM ENTROPY

YES LOCALLY IN SMALL REGIONS OF SPACE THE ENTROPY OF AN OPEN SYSTEM CAN INDEED DECREASE IF AND ONLY IF THE ENTROPY OF THE ENVIRONMENT AROUND IT INCREASES BY THE EXACT SAME AMOUNT

ENTROPY S IS EXPRESSED AS ENERGY DIVIDED BY TEMPERATURE

HERE'S AN EXAMPLE

MOST OF THE ENERGY PRESENT ON EARTH COMES FROM THE SUN AS PHOTONS DISCRETE PACKETS OF LIGHT ENERGY FOR EVERY PHOTON THAT EARTH RECEIVES FROM THE SUN IT RADIATES ABOUT AWAY BACK INTO SPACE IF YOU COUNT UP ALL THE DISCRETE ENERGIES OF THE OUTGOING PHOTONS THEY MATCH THE ENERGY OF THE SINGLE INCOMING PHOTON SO WHAT GOES IN COMES BACK OUT HOWEVER WHAT COMES OUT IS FAR LESS USEFUL THAN WHAT CAME IN THE WEAK PHOTONS THAT LEAVE EARTH WILL WHEN THEY ARE EVENTUALLY ABSORBED BY AN ATOM OR MOLECULE NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE MUCH ENERGY TO THE SYSTEM WHICH WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO MUCH WORK AND SO IT GOES ON THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY NEVER CHANGES BUT IT BECOMES SO DILUTE THAT IT STOPS BEING OF ANY USE AS IT CAN NO LONGER POWER ANY REACTIONS MAXIMUM ENTROPY ACHIEVED

THE USAGE OF THE TERM EXACT IS UNDER REVIEW
INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER
ASK UNIVAC
FROM WIKIPEDIA

STATISTICAL MECHANICS GIVES AN EXPLANATION FOR THE SECOND LAW BY POSTULATING THAT A MATERIAL IS COMPOSED OF ATOMS AND MOLECULES WHICH ARE IN CONSTANT MOTION A PARTICULAR SET OF POSITIONS AND VELOCITIES FOR EACH PARTICLE IN THE SYSTEM IS CALLED A MICROSTATE OF THE SYSTEM AND BECAUSE OF THE CONSTANT MOTION THE SYSTEM IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING ITS MICROSTATE STATISTICAL MECHANICS POSTULATES THAT IN EQUILIBRIUM EACH MICROSTATE THAT THE SYSTEM MIGHT BE IN IS EQUALLY LIKELY TO OCCUR AND WHEN THIS ASSUMPTION IS MADE IT LEADS DIRECTLY TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE SECOND LAW MUST HOLD IN A STATISTICAL SENSE THAT IS THE SECOND LAW WILL HOLD ON AVERAGE WITH A STATISTICAL VARIATION ON THE ORDER OF N WHERE N IS THE NUMBER OF PARTICLES IN THE SYSTEM FOR EVERYDAY MACROSCOPIC SITUATIONS THE PROBABILITY THAT THE SECOND LAW WILL BE VIOLATED IS PRACTICALLY ZERO HOWEVER FOR SYSTEMS WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF PARTICLES THERMODYNAMIC PARAMETERS INCLUDING THE ENTROPY MAY SHOW SIGNIFICANT STATISTICAL DEVIATIONS FROM THAT PREDICTED BY THE SECOND LAW CLASSICAL THERMODYNAMIC THEORY DOES NOT DEAL WITH THESE STATISTICAL VARIATIONS

THERMODYNAMICS NEVER BY AN AXIOM
STATISTICAL MECHANICS YES BUT VERY UNLIKELY
INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER
YES LOCALLY APPLY ENERGY CREATE MORE ORDER ONCE THAT ENERGY IS REMOVED SYSTEM WILL MOVE TO A MORE ENTROPIC STATE

ENERGY TO STACK A BUNCH OF QUARTERS YOU'VE CREATED A MORE ORDERED LESS ENTROPY SYSTEM WALK AWAY AND EVENTUALLY YOU'LL FIND WITHOUT YOU ADDING ENERGY TO THE SYSTEM THE STACK OF QUARTERS COLLAPSED THROUGH A RANDOM ADDITION OF ENERGY FROM THE ENVIRONMENT

THERE ARE MORE WAYS FOR RANDOM ENERGY TO ENTER THE SYSTEM THAN THERE ARE FOR A VERY SPECIFIC FORM OF ENERGY TO ENTER THE SYSTEM TO MAINTAIN THE ORDERED LOWER ENTROPY STATE

YOU CAN NEVER WIN YOU CAN NEVER BREAK EVEN GIVEN LONG ENOUGH TIME SCALES THE HOUSE ALWAYS WINS
WHEN ENERGY CHANGES FORM THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE TO DO WORK DECREASES DURING THE TRANSFORMATION THE MISSING ENERGY IS ENTROPY IT HELPS TO THINK ABOUT ENGINES AND PERPETUAL MOTION IF YOU WANT TO BOTHER WITH MATH STUFF
NOPE
YOU SHOULD READ ARCADIA BY TOM STOPPARD
NO
REVERSING ENTROPY WOULD MEAN GOING BACK IN TIME SO A SHORT ANSWER NUMBER
HOWEVER IF YOU MEAN DECREASING THEN YOU COULD ONLY IN AN OPEN SYSTEM THIS IS POSSIBLE IN A CLOSED SYSTEM THE HIGHER THE ENTROPY THE MORE IN EQUILIBRIUM THE SYSTEM IS WHEN THIS CLOSED SYSTEM IS IN EQUILIBRIUM THEN IT CANNOT GO BACK TO THE STATE IT STARTED AT
LET'S USE THE EXAMPLE OF COFFEE AND MILK I KNOW THIS IS USED A LOT BUT IT WORKS ON A SIMPLE SCALE WHEN YOU STIR THE MILK IN THE COFFEE THEN THE MILK WILL SPREAD AROUND THE COFFEE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND WILL REACH EQUILIBRIUM HOWEVER AS TIME GOES BY THE MILK WILL NOT SEPARATE FROM THE COFFEE AND GROUP UP IN ONE SPOT THIS IS WHY ENTROPY CANNOT BE REVERSED
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ENTROPY IS THE MEASURE DISORDER WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY REVERSING THAT
FOUND THIS FUN NEW WAY OF LEVITATING MAGNETS OVER COPPER THE GRADE CUBE MAGNETS ARE LEVITATING WHEN THEIR AXLE OF POLARITY IS LINED HORIZONTALLY ON A DEGREE ANGLE IN RESPECT TO THE ALTERNATING POLES OF THE MAGNET ABOVE THIS MAGNETIC GEAR SYSTEM INDUCES THE SPINNING THE FLAT RECTANGULAR MAGNET IS STRONGER GRADE AND IT IS ABLE TO LEVITATE EVEN WITH A VERTICAL AXLE OF POLARITY
IT'S CALLED AN ANTIBUBBLE

A DROPLET OF LIQUID SURROUNDED BY A THIN FILM OF GAS AS OPPOSED TO A GAS BUBBLE WHICH IS A SPHERE OF GAS SURROUNDED BY A LIQUID

AIR IS ADHERING TO THE DROPLETS
BUT WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT THE CELLO DOES THAT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH CRACKING SNAPPING DON'T KNOW A BETTER WORD FOR IT TYPE OF SOUND THAT IS PRODUCED BY A BOW ON A STRING THAT IT EXCITES THE WATER A SO MUCH THE DROPLETS BREAK OFF
U MRPENNYWHISTLE

NICE VIDEO I BET MOUTHS DROPPED QUITE OFTEN
I'M ONLY A MINUTE INTO THE VIDEO BUT I'M GONNA PAUSE HERE TO MAKE MY PREDICTIONS

HAVING JUST WATCHED THIS VERITASIUM VIDEO I'M GOING TO GUESS THAT THIS PHENOMENA IS CAUSED BY STANDING WAIVES ON THE SURFACE PREVENTING THE BEAD OF LIQUID FROM BEING OK TIME TO KEEP WATCHING

HEY I WAS RIGHT AND DESTIN LINKS THE VERITASIUM VIDEO TOO HOLLY COW THAT CELLO AIR BUBBLE CLIP IS AMAZING AND BEAUTIFUL
GOD THE CC IS SO FAR OFF BASE
IS THERE A FULL VIDEO OF THE BACH CELLO SUITE AND THE DANCING WATER EFFECT THAT ANYONE KNOWS OF
THAT WAS PRETTY NEAT
THAT WAS JUST AWESOME KUDOS TO THE GUY FOR NOT GIVING UP
DELETED
BOBS MEMORIES ONLY WORK IN THE POSITIVE ENTROPY DIRECTION SO HE CAN HAVE NO RECOLLECTION OF THIS NEGATIVE ENTROPY U AND CAN ONLY REMEMBER THE U
WHY WOULDN'T THE MUCH BIGGER UNIVERSE AROUND BOB HAVE THE SAME IMPACT ON BOB THAT YOU THINK BOB WOULD BE HAVING ON THE UNIVERSE WOULDN'T BOB IMMEDIATELY DIE BECAUSE THE ENTROPY WOULD CAUSE BOB'S LUNGS TO EXUDE OXYGEN AND ABSORB CARBON DIOXIDE
THERE REALLY ISN'T ANYTHING THE LOC ISN'T CAPABLE OF DOING DAMAGE ON ANYTHING BUT AN EXTREMELY LOCAL SCALE SOME THINGS COULD MELT OTHERS COULD EXPLODE THERE COULD BE SOME SLIGHT RADIATION LEAKS BUT NOTHING REALLY BIG NOTHING THAT ANYONE OUTSIDE OF THE FACILITY WOULD NOTICE
THE LOC IS ONLY A THREAT TO YOU IF YOU ARE A WEASEL IF YOU ARE A WEASEL STAY AWAY FROM THE POWER CABLES
A CASCADE RESONANCE

EDIT I MEANT RESONANCE CASCADE ACTUALLY
WATCH THIS WEBCAM FOR A MINUTE

LOC
VACUUM DECAY MAYBE IT'S TO DO WITH THE HIGGS FIELD WHICH AS WE KNOW IS THE SOLE REASON THE LOC WAS CREATED YES THAT'S SARCASM
CONSIDERING THAT MOTHER NATURE HAS BEEN FIRING OFF SUBATOMIC PARTICLES AT US WITH ENERGIES FAR EXCEEDING THAT WHICH COULD BE PRODUCED BY LOC FOR BILLIONS OF YEARS AND NOTHING CATASTROPHIC OR APOCALYPTIC HAS HAPPENED IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT LOC IS INCAPABLE OF CREATING THE EVENTS YOU ARE LOOKING FOR
MAYBE AN EVENT COULD TRIGGER THE COLLAPSE OF THE HIGGS FIELD FROM A FALSE VACUUM TO A REAL VACUUM CHANGING THE VERY LAWS OF PHYSICS AND CAUSING THE UNIVERSE TO CEASE TO EXIST WITHIN A SPHERE SPREADING AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT OUTWARD FROM THE POINT OF ORIGIN

SHARED CI
NONE THIS EXPLAINS WHY
THE LOC NOTHING REALLY

EVEN IF THE LOC SOMEHOW HOW THE CAPABILITY TO CAUSE MASSIVE DESTRUCTION THERE IS NO WAY THAT SOME TOP PHYSICIST WORKING THERE WOULD BE ABLE TO TRICK EVERYONE INTO BELIEVING THEM YOU WOULD LITERALLY NEED EITHER SOME SORT OF WHO KNOWS THINGS ABOUT PHYSICS THAT WE CANNOT POSSIBLY YET KNOW OR SOME SORT OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN MOST IF NOT ALL OF THE PHYSICISTS THERE
I REMEMBER SOME CHATTER ABOUT WHETHER THE LOC COULD PRODUCE TINY BLACK HOLES BY FORCING A GREAT DEAL OF ENERGY INTO A VERY SMALL VOLUME THERE'S NO GOOD SCIENCE BEHIND IT AS FAR AS I KNOW BUT THE IDEA CIRCULATED IN THE POPULAR MEDIA FOR SOME TIME SINCE THIS IS SCI-FI YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH A EXPLANATION OF HOW THIS HAPPENED EVEN THOUGH MOST PHYSICISTS AGREE THAT IT CANNOT HAPPEN

ALTERNATELY JUST ABANDON THE STANDARD MODEL ENTIRELY AND HAVE THE LOC ACCIDENTALLY PRODUCE SOME EXOTIC PARTICLE THAT NOBODY CAN UNDERSTAND OR EXPLAIN MAYBE IT CONVERTS EVERYTHING IT TOUCHES INTO ANTIMATTER OR SOME WILD SHIT LIKE THAT AS LONG AS YOU STICK TO INSTEAD OF TRYING TO ACTUALLY EXPLAIN IT WITH PHYSICS I'D BE WILLING TO SUSPEND DISBELIEF IT'S USUALLY THE ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE A DETAILED EXPLANATION THAT IRRITATES ME BECAUSE IT'S NEVER CORRECT AND IT DOESN'T FURTHER THE STORY

I APPRECIATED A SCENE IN LOOPER WHERE ONE CHARACTER STARTS TALKING ABOUT TIME TRAVEL AND CAUSALITY PARADOXES AND THE OTHER CHARACTER JUST SAYS SOMETHING LIKE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW IT WORKS THAT'S THE END OF IT LET'S MOVE ON WAVE YOUR HANDS AND FOCUS ON THE STORY
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL AND DEFINITELY COOL PHYSICS DOES IT HAVE AN ANALOG IN OTHER PHYSICAL SYSTEMS THOUGH I KNOW OIL DROPS HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED AS VISUALIZATIONS OF THEORY BUT I'M MORE CURIOUS ABOUT THE COUPLED OSCILLATIONS

ALSO WHICH IF ANY DROPLETS COULD YOU REMOVE WITHOUT DISTURBING THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE I'M CURIOUS WHAT OTHER SHAPES WOULD BE POSSIBLE

IS THIS WHAT QUANTUM MECHANICS LOOKS LIKE THESE TYPES OF EXPERIMENTS ARE PERFORMED IN AN OIL BATH WHICH IS MECHANICALLY VIBRATED TYPICALLY IT IS AN UPTURNED SPEAKER CONVERTED TO HOLD AN OIL BATH AND VIBRATED BY DRIVING THE COILS WITH A SINUSOIDAL VOLTAGE THERE WILL BE ENERGY INPUT INTO DRI
METRONOME SYNCHRONIZATION 2 MANY ARRAYS OF OSCILLATING SYSTEMS WILL IN MOST CASES SYNCHRONIZE WITH AN OUTSIDE DRIVING FORCE
WELCOME TO THE ELECTRIC UNIVERSE THEORY HD DOCUMENTARY WHERE ELSE DOES THIS SORT OF THING CROP UP
I'M A BOT WORKING HARD TO HELP REDDITORS FIND RELATED VIDEOS TO WATCH

PLAY ALL INFO GET IT ON CHROME FIREBOX
THIS IS GETTING WAY OUT OF HAND THERE IS NO CONNECTION WITH PHYSICS ANYMORE
THERE ARE MANY EXPERIMENTS LIKE THIS ONE GOING ON RIGHT NOW TO TEST THE PILOT WAVES INTERPRETATION OF QUANTUM MECHANICS MOST OF OUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF QUANTUM MECHANICS COMES FROM EXPERIMENTAL INTERPRETATION WHICH LEADS TO PHILOSOPHICALLY CONFUSING RESULTS
HOW CAN A PARTICLE HAVE WAVE PROPERTIES WHY DOES A WAVEFORM COLLAPSE TO ONE STATE WHEN YOU MEASURE IT
THESE KINDS OF QUESTIONS HAVE NO CLASSICAL ANALOGY WHICH MAKES THEM DIFFICULT TO CONCEPTUALIZE BUT THE PILOT WAVES INTERPRETATION SEEKS TO RELATE THE CLASSICAL FLUID DYNAMICS OF DROPLETS BOUNCING ON A VIBRATING BATH TO QUANTUM MECHANICS TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS
THIS IS REALLY COOL TO SEE AND SEEMS SO STRANGE AT FIRST THINKING ABOUT IT THOUGH IT'S LIKE OH OF COURSE THEY WOULD
WOULD THIS QUALIFY AS A TIME CRYSTAL
BUT CAN'T THEY NOT BOUNCE FOREVER THERE HAS TO BE SOME ENERGY LOSS THIS ISN'T A PERPETUAL MOTION MACHINE WAS I PERHAPS LIED TO BY THE INTERNET HYPE MACHINE
THIS IS SO COOL AND IT ALSO MAKES ME WONDER WHY THEY ARE NOT TEACHING THIS IN SCHOOL
PERPETUAL MOTION
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS FOR A SECOND THE DROPLET WOULD EVENTUALLY COME TO A REST ON THE SURFACE OF THE OIL THIS IS PRETTY EASY TO DEBUNK BY ANYONE WHO HAS EVER POURED OIL INTO ANYTHING
NOT AT ALL THOUGH IT CERTAINLY MEANS THAT A COMPLETE ALL PROPOSITIONS HAVE A PROOF OR AN MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION WON'T BE A PART OF THIS IF YOU CONSIDER IT NECESSARY FOR A TOE TO BE ABLE TO ASSERT THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH OR FALSITY OF ANY STATEMENT WE CAN MAKE THEN THE ANSWER IS YES THAT BEING SAID THERE ARE PLENTY OF QUITE CHEERFUL THEORIES WHICH GET ALONG QUITE FINE WITHOUT THIS PROPERTY PER S THE CALCULUS OF INDUCTIVE CONDUCTIVE CONSTRUCTIONS BEING EASIEST TO ROK AMONG THEM IMHO

DEPENDING ON YOUR PERCEPTION OF WHAT PROOF AND LOGICAL TRUTH IS THIS IS MORE OR LESS UPSETTING I'D SAY FOR INSTANCE THERE'S A NOTION OF CONSTRUCTIBLE OBJECT BEING EQUIVALENT TO PROVABLE PROPOSITION SO IF YOU CONSIDER THAT THERE MAY BE OBJECTS IN THE UNIVERSE WHICH WE CAN'T CONSTRUCT BUT ALSO CAN'T SEE WHY NOT THIS ISN'T ALL THAT SHOCKING IT IS SIMPLY HUMBLING IF YOU BELIEVE IN THE MORE CLASSICAL INTERPRETATIONS WHICH ESSENTIALLY TAKE TRUTH TO BE A SENTENCE DESIGNATING SOME STATE OF AFFAIRS YOU MIGHT BE QUITE CONFUSED ABOUT THE NOTION OF SOMETHING BEING TRUE WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO BE SHOWN AT ALL THIS IS SORT OF A HUGE DEFICIENCY OF THIS VIEW OF LOGIC IMHO BUT ITS THE ONE IN THE MAINSTREAM STILL TODAY

LISTEN TO VLADAMIR VOEVODSKY FOR MUCH BETTER AND MORE COMPLETE TALKS ON THIS SUBJECT PARTICULARLY HIS TALK QUESTIONING THE CONSISTENCY OF FIRST ORDER ARITHMETIC AS AN INTERPRETATION OF 2ND THEOREM
IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT ONE MEANS BY A TOE OF COURSE THIS IS TOO HARD TO DEFINE SINCE THERE WILL ALWAYS BE OPPONENTS TO ANY DEFINITION GIVEN INSTEAD LET'S CONSIDER A SCENARIO TAKEN FROM PERSPECTIVE HETP ON THE MATTER WHAT IF CONJECTURE IS A TRUE BUT UNPROVABLE STATEMENT

CONJECTURE SAYS THAT EVERY EVEN NUMBER GREATER THAN 2 IS THE SUM OF TWO PRIMES WE CAN MAKE THIS PROBLEM PHYSICAL BY ASKING CAN WE ALWAYS SPLIT AN EVEN PILE OF WOOD BLOCKS INTO TWO PILES EACH OF WHICH CAN BE MADE INTO A RECTANGLE

IS THIS A QUESTION OUR TOE SHOULD BE ABLE TO ANSWER IF YES THEN ONE CAN PROBABLY MAKE A GOOD ARGUMENT THAT THEOREMS SUGGEST THAT A TOE IS UNATTAINABLE ON THE OTHER HAND MAYBE OUR TOE DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO ANSWER CONJECTURE IT SHOULD JUST BE ABLE TO ANSWER IT FOR ANY SPECIFIC EVEN NUMBER NOT ALL EVEN NUMBERS THAT IS GIVEN ANY EVEN NUMBER ONE CAN FIND IN A FINITE NUMBER OF STEPS IF THIS EVEN NUMBER IS THE SUM OF TWO PRIMES PERHAPS THAT IS WHAT IS SUFFICIENT FOR A TOE
DOES THE TRUE BUT NOT PROVABLE RESTRICTION IMPLY THAT WE CAN NEVER DESCRIBE ANY SITUATION

UNLESS WE ARE STRICT RATIONALISTS PROOF IS NOT THE ONLY SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE

ALSO UNLESS WE ARE STRICTLY HONEST KNOWLEDGE IS NOT THE ONLY SOURCE OF DESCRIPTIONS ASTROPHYSICS WAS USED TO DESCRIBE FICTIONAL EXOPLANETS FOR DECADES BEFORE ANY REAL ONES WERE DISCOVERED AND NOTHING BROKE
IF WE WOULD FOCUS ON PREDICTABILITY INSTEAD OF FIGURING OUR THE TRUTHFULNESS OF THE ANY STATEMENT ABOUT PHYSICS WORLD THEN THE SITUATION IS REALLY UNKNOWN
LET'S DEFINE PREDICTION A BIT MORE HERE I WOULD ASSUME THAT IT MEANS PREDICTING FUTURE STATE OF A THEORETICAL UNIVERSE AT TIME SAT ABOUT WHICH WE HAVE A PERFECT KNOWLEDGE A TIME WHAT IS OBVIOUSLY IMPOSSIBLE HOWEVER WE ARE INTERESTED IF IT WAS POSSIBLE FROM CALCULATION POINT OF VIEW NOT MEASUREMENT POV
OBVIOUSLY PRACTICALLY IT WOULD STILL BE INFEASIBLE BECAUSE IT IS HARD TO MODEL UNIVERSE BUT WE DON'T CARE ABOUT TIME IT WOULD TAKE
SO LET'S TAKE VERY SMALL THEORETICAL UNIVERSE LET'S ASSUME ITS FINITE AND THAT ACCURACY OF CALCULATIONS IS NOT A PROBLEM

WE HOPE EVERYTHING LEFT IS BASED ON CERTAIN RULES AND WE CAN CALCULATE ANY STATE AT ANY TIME TAKE FROM CONTINUOUS SET SINCE WE HAVE A COUNTABLE SET OF RULES WE CAN'T DECIDE TRUTHFULNESS OF ALL TRUE STATEMENTS HOWEVER AT THIS POINT WE HAVE NOTHING THAT WOULD SAY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CALCULATE SOME FUTURE STATE HOWEVER THE PHYSIC OF UNIVERSE IS STRANGE AND THERE INFINITIES INVOLVED IN SUCH A PREDICTIONS AND IT MAY STILL REQUIRE TO DECIDE TRUTH OF ANY KIND OF ARITHMETIC STATEMENT I EAST IN DECIDING POSSIBLE QUANTUM STATE OF INFINITE NUMBER OF VIRTUAL PARTICLES OR CALCULATING THE OUTCOME OF DIMENSION INFINITE CALCULATION

PUT IT LIKE THIS BY ANALOGY TO COMPUTERS IT IS NEVER POSSIBLE TO DECIDE IF THE PROGRAM WILL FINISH OR NOT WITH A SINGLE ALGORITHM HOWEVER IT IS QUITE EASY TO DECIDE A STATE IN NTH STEP OF GIVEN PROGRAM HOWEVER IF YOU ADD EXTRA TIME DIMENSIONS THE PROGRAM CAN RUN INTO OR IF YOU ADD UNKNOWN OMNIPOTENT ORACLES THEN IT BECOMES INFEASIBLE

ALSO THE GODEL THEOREM IS NOT AS STRONG AS YOU WOULD THINK IN PHYSICAL WORLD THERE ALWAYS POSSIBILITY OF A SET OF RULES TO DECIDE TRUTHFULNESS OF ANY STATEMENT FROM ANY FINITE OR COUNTABLE SET YOU CAN'T REALLY ASK MORE QUESTIONS THAN THAT
SURPRISINGLY THERE CAN NOT BE SUCH A TOE JUST LAST YEAR IT WAS PROVEN THAT A QUITE SIMPLE PHYSICAL PROBLEM IS ACTUALLY UNDECIDABLE NAMELY THE MASS GAP CONJECTURE I EAST IS THERE AN ENERGY GAP BETWEEN THE DISCRETE ENERGY STATES OF A SYSTEM AND THE CONTINUOUS STATES WHICH IS QUITE IMPORTANT FOR SEMICONDUCTORS

THE PAPER IS FOUND HERE
NATURE JOURNAL FULL

IN A NUTSHELL THE AUTHORS SHOWED THAT THE MASS GAP CONJECTURE IN 2D SPIN LATTICE SYSTEMS AMOUNTED TO SOLVING THE HALTING PROBLEM WHICH IS UNSOLVABLE

I FIND THIS QUITE AMAZING AS THIS DISPROVES THE EXISTENCE OF A TOE FOR A GIVEN SYSTEM AS THIS MEANS THAT WHILE WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MEASURE THE MASS GAP WE CAN NOT COME UP WITH A THEORY FROM WHICH WE CAN DERIVE THAT THE SYSTEM HAS A MASS GAP
NOTE THAT WHEN YOU ARE SEARCHING FOR COURSE INFORMATION COLLEGE PHYSICS IS USUALLY THE NAME OF AN PHYSICS COURSE FOR BIOLOGY AND OTHER SOFT SCIENCE MAJORS WHILE UNIVERSITY PHYSICS IS THE NAME OF THE PHYSICS COURSE FOR MATH PHYSICS ENGINEERING AND CHEMISTRY MAJORS

YOUR UNIVERSITY PHYSICS COURSE WILL COVER MECHANICS DYNAMICS ROTATIONAL MOTION THERMODYNAMICS WAVE MOTION ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM

SECOND YEAR YOU WILL MOST LIKELY GET INTO MODERN PHYSICS WHICH COVERS SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF QUANTUM MECHANICS
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND DAVID INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRODYNAMICS IT IS A CLASSIC UNDERGRADUATE TEXT IN ELECTRODYNAMICS HIS STYLE IS A BIT WORDY BUT I FEEL IT COMPLEMENTS ALL OF THE MATHEMATICS WELL IT BEGINS WITH A GOOD OVERVIEW OF VECTOR CALCULUS WHICH IS NECESSARY TO DO COLLEGE LEVEL E M SO THE TEXT IS MANAGEABLE EVEN IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN EXPOSED TO CALC YET
WHATEVER THE LIGHTEST NEUTRINO IS IT'S THAT WE'RE STILL NOT SURE OF THE ACTUAL NEUTRINO MASSES ONLY THE SQUARED DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEIR MASSES WE DO KNOW HOWEVER THAT THE SUM OF THE THREE NEUTRINO MASSES IS LESS THAN EV
SO THE NEUTRINO IS THE LIGHTEST PARTICLE WE KNOW OF IS THE AXION PREDICTED IN THIS NEW RESEARCH LIGHTER THAN A NEUTRINO
THERE IS SOME CONFUSION IN SOME OF THE OTHER COMMENTS

LEAST MASSIVE PARTICLES BEST OF

ELECTRON PRETTY LIGHT CAN BE TAKEN TO BE MASSLESS IN LOTS OF CASES HAS A MASS OF EV

2 NEUTRINOS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR MASSES ARE THE UPPER LIMIT IS EV LESS IF YOU BELIEVE DATA COMBINATIONS OF BAO AND WE DO KNOW THE MASS SPLITTINGS SORT OF IT IS DEFINITELY POSSIBLE THAT ONE OF THEM IS EXACTLY MASSLESS ALTHOUGH THIS IS AWKWARD THEORETICALLY WE HAVE NO EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE ON THE ISSUE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER

PHOTONS GLUONS AND GRAVITONS THEY HAVE NO MASS THEORETICALLY IN PRACTICE MEASURING SOMETHING TO HAVE ZERO MASS IS TRICKY IT CAN BE DONE SOMEWHAT BY MEASURING THE NUMBER OF DEGREES OF SPIN FREEDOM MASSLESS PARTICLES HAVE TWO WHILE MASSIVE HAVE THE EXPERIMENTAL LIMITS ON THE PHOTON ARE QUITE STRONG AND ROBUST THE EXPERIMENTAL LIMITS ON THE GLUON ARE ROBUST AND KINDA STRONG THE LIMITS ON THE GRAVITON ARE KINDA STRONG AND NOT AT ALL ROBUST

ALL OF THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT OP ASKED ABOUT WHICH IS SIZE DOESN'T REALLY MEAN WHAT WE THINK IT DOES BUT ROUGHLY TRANSLATES INTO CROSS SECTION A CONCEPT RELATED TO PROBABILITY OF INTERACTING FOR EXAMPLE FOR A TENNIS BALL FLYING THROUGH THE AIR IN THE PRESENCE OF OTHER TENNIS BALLS FLYING THROUGH THE AIR THE CROSS SECTION IS PI R 2 THE CROSS SECTIONAL AREA FOR PARTICLES HOWEVER IT IS MORE COMPLICATED ELECTRONS SEEM TO HAVE INFINITE CROSS SECTION FOR EXAMPLE ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT CROSS SECTION IN PARTICULAR WAY SCALES WITH THE MASS OF THE PARTICLE PHOTONS HAVE SUBSTANTIAL CROSS SECTIONS FOR EXAMPLE

THE SMALLEST CROSS SECTION IS A BIT OF A TRICKY THING TO DEFINE BUT ROUGHLY SPEAKING IT WOULD BE THE NEUTRINO THE NEUTRINO ISN'T CHARGED UNDER HYPERCHARGE OR COLOR CHARGE ONLY WEAK SO ITS CROSS SECTION IS QUITE SMALL BY ALL PRACTICAL MEASURES THEY CORRESPOND TO THE LOWEST CROSS SECTIONS MEASURED

THAT SAID IF DM IS MADE UP OF WIMPS A VERY POPULAR IDEA FOR MANY REASONS ITS CROSS SECTION IS PROBABLY QUITE A BIT SMALLER THAN THAT OF NEUTRINOS
WHAT DO YOU THINK WORLDLIKE MEANS
I THINK YOU ARE USING THE WORD WORLD LINE NOT ACCORDING TO ITS MEANING

A WORLD LINE IS THE PATH OF AN OBJECT IN SPACETIME NOTHING TO DO WITH OTHER UNIVERSES

YES WHEN BLACK HOLES COLLIDE IT CAN BE FELT ACROSS WORLD LINES GRAVITATIONAL WAVES COULD BE DETECTED ON EARTH BUT WORLD LINES DON'T MEAN WHAT YOU THINK THEY MEAN

ALSO THERE'S NO WORLD LINE THEORY
GRAVITATION WAVES TRAVEL AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT SO IF THE WORLD LINES OF OBJECTS GRAVITATIONAL WAVE ARE WITHIN A LIGHT CONE THEN THE GRAVITATIONAL DISTURBANCE WILL INTERACT

WORLD LINES ARE SIMPLY AN OBJECT'S MOTION IN SPACETIME AND HAVE A LOCAL ZONE THAT DICTATE WHERE THEY CAN INTERACT OR THEY CANNOT INTERACT BECAUSE THE LIGHT SPEED DISTANCE IS TOO GREAT BETWEEN WORLD LINES

GENERAL RELATIVITY HAS BEEN TESTED AND IT'S PREDICTIVE ABILITY IS SPOT ON WORLD LINES ARE JUST A CONVENIENT WAY TO THINK ABOUT HOW SPACETIME OBJECTS INTERACT IN TERMS OF GRAMMAR AS WE LEARN MORE OR EVEN ABLE TO DETECT QUANTUM GRAVITY A LOT OF HOW WE EXPLAIN GRAVITATIONAL WAVES MAY CHANGE BUT FOR NOW THERE IS NO REASON TO THINK GENERAL RELATIVITY CANNOT EXPLAIN HOW GRAVITATIONAL WAVES AND WORLD LINES INTERACT THE FACT THAT FIGO KNEW EXACTLY WHAT TO LOOK FOR AND ACTUALLY DETECT IT SHOULD GIVE YOU MORE EVIDENCE THAT GR IS EXPLAINING HOW OUR UNIVERSE WORKS EXTREMELY WELL
ONCE AGAIN WE HAVE A NEW CLAIM THAT METALLIC HYDROGEN HAS BEEN DIRECTLY FORMED AND OBSERVED IN THE LABORATORY IF THIS NEW RESULT END UP BEING TRUE IT WOULD BE A PRETTY BIG DEAL SINCE PHYSICISTS HAVE BEEN HUNTING FOR DIRECT EVIDENCE OF METALLIC HYDROGEN FOR DECADES FOR A BRIEF EXPLANATION AND HISTORY OF THE FIELD HERE IS A DECENTLY GOOD AND ACCESSIBLE INTRODUCTION NOW WE HAVE SEEN SIMILAR CLAIMS IN THE PAST BUT SO FAR THESE CLAIMS HAVE FAILED TO STAND UP TO CLOSER SCRUTINY THIS MOST RECENT CLAIM COMES FROM THE SILVERA GROUP AT HARVARD HETP THEY ALSO USED A DIAMOND ANVIL CELL TO SQUEEZE HYDROGEN TO INSANE PRESSURES OF UP TO THAT'S A PRESSURE COMPARABLE TO THE PRESSURE FOUND IN THE DEPTHS OF THE CORE AT THEY REPORT SEEING A PHASE TRANSITION WHERE THE HYDROGEN TURNS REFLECTIVE THEY THEN FIT THE OPTICAL DATA TO THE PREDICTIONS OF THE CRUDE MODEL AND CLAIM THAT THEY HAVE CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT THE PHASE THEY SEE IS METALLIC TO QUOTE THE ABSTRACT
WE HAVE STUDIED SOLID HYDROGEN UNDER PRESSURE AT LOW TEMPERATURES WITH INCREASING PRESSURE WE OBSERVE CHANGES IN THE SAMPLE GOING FROM TRANSPARENT TO BLACK TO A REFLECTIVE METAL THE LATTER STUDIED AT A PRESSURE OF GA WE HAVE MEASURED THE REFLECTANCE AS A FUNCTION OF WAVELENGTH IN THE VISIBLE SPECTRUM FINDING VALUES AS HIGH AS FROM THE METALLIC HYDROGEN WE HAVE FIT THE REFLECTANCE USING A CRUDE FREE ELECTRON MODEL TO DETERMINE THE PLASMA FREQUENCY OF EV AT T K WITH A CORRESPONDING ELECTRON CARRIER DENSITY OF PARTICLES CM CONSISTENT WITH THEORETICAL ESTIMATES THE PROPERTIES ARE THOSE OF A METAL SOLID METALLIC HYDROGEN HAS BEEN PRODUCED IN THE LABORATORY

ALL THIS IS PRETTY EXCITING BUT WE'LL HAVE TO SEE WHAT HOLES OTHERS IN THE FIELD MAY TRY TO DIG INTO THIS NEW REPORT
PRETTY COOL MOST OF WHAT I READ ABOUT METALLIC HYDROGEN IS SOMETHING LIKE WE BLASTED SOME HYDROGEN WITH A FEMTOSECOND LASER AND ONE OF THE SPECTRAL LINES MIGHT BE SIMILAR TO SOMETHING PREDICTED BY DENSITY FUNCTIONAL THEORY FOR METALLIC HYDROGEN IF WE SQUINT THIS SEEMS TO BE A BIG STEP FORWARD
CHECK OUT LOOP QUANTUM GRAVITY A QUITE POPULAR APPROACH TO QUANTUM GRAVITY USING GR AS A STARTING POINT TO QUANTIZE SPACETIME INTO A LATTICE OF NODES OR KNOTS WHERE SPACETIME SORT OF LOOPS AROUND ON ITSELF MIGHT BE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR PROVIDED I DIDNT MISUNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION
APART FROM THE ALREADY MENTIONED LOOP QUANTUM GRAVITY THERE ARE A BUNCH OF OTHER IDEAS OF HOW TO QUANTIZE SPACETIME LIKE FOR EXAMPLE CAUSAL SETS CAUSAL DYNAMICAL TRIANGULATION AND SHAPE DYNAMICS THE REASON YOU SELDOM HEAR ABOUT THEM IS BECAUSE VERY FEW PEOPLE WORK ON THESE VARIOUS THINGS AND ALSO WHICH OF COURSE IS CLOSELY RELATED BECAUSE THEY TYPICALLY DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH IN THE WAY OF INTERESTING RESULTS
JUST TO CLARIFY LAG IS NOT DISCRETIZATION OF SPACETIME THE SEPARATION INTO TETRAHEDRA IN LAG IS ANALOGOUS TO THE FOURIER EXPANSION OF FIELDS IN AFT THE TETRAHEDRA ARE JUST MATHEMATICAL TOOLS TO EXPRESS THE QUANTIZATION
THE POINT IS WHILE A GREAT VARIETY OF SUCH MODELS HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED LAG IN PREMIS THEY SHARE A VERY GENERAL FEATURE THEY DON'T WORK THE MAIN ISSUE IS THEY DON'T REPRODUCE A SMOOTH SPACETIME IN THE CLASSICAL LIMIT WHEN YOU MANAGE TO QUANTIZE THEM OFC
THERE IS FAIRLY POPULAR LOOP QUANTUM GRAVITY WHERE SPACE IS QUANTIZED AN THUS POSSES SOME GRANULAR STRUCTURE I'M NOT SURE WHETHER THIS IS STILL PROBLEM OR NOT BUT SOME PHYSICISTS ARGUE D THAT THIS THEORY VIOLATES LORENTZ INVARIANCE THERE ARE ALSO NONCOMMUTATIVE QUANTUM FIELD THEORIES WHERE COORDINATES DO NOT COMMUTE WHICH RESULTS INTO UNCERTAINTY RELATION FOR COORDINATES SOME OF THEM ARE STAND ALONE BUT OFTEN USED IN CONTEXT OF STRING THEORY AND I KNOW AT LEAST ONE WHICH ARISES FROM OPEN STRING THEORY AS SOME LIMIT THESE THEORIES HAVE HOWEVER SOME STRANGE PROPERTIES SUCH AS UV IR MIXING BUT I THINK THERE ARE SOME RECENT PROPOSALS ON HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS RATHER UNPLEASING PHENOMENON
OP AS MANY HAVE MENTIONED LOOP QUANTUM GRAVITY FEATURES A DISCRETE SPACE TIME IN A CERTAIN SENSE I HAVE SOME FAMILIARITY WITH THE THEORY THOUGH I AM MUCH MORE FAMILIAR WITH APPROXIMATE VERSIONS OF IT THAN THE FULL THEORY HOWEVER IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT LAG I CAN TRY TO ANSWER THEM FOR YOU AND IF I SAY SOMETHING WRONG MAYBE SOMEONE WHO KNOWS MORE THAN ME CAN CHIME IN

EDIT
TO ANSWER THE THRUST OF YOUR QUESTION YES THERE ARE THEORIES WITH DISCRETE SPACE TIME HOWEVER THEY ARE CLEARLY SOMEWHAT UNPOPULAR PART OF THE REASON FOR THIS UNPOPULARITY IS THAT CERTAIN SYMMETRIES ARE BROKEN WHEN YOU GO TO DISCRETE SPACE TIME AND WE HAVE SOME CONVINCING EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE THAT THESE SYMMETRIES HOLD TOO WELL TO BE DESCRIBED BY THESE DISCRETE THEORIES ONE REASON FOR LAGS POPULARITY IS THAT IT SOLVES THIS PROBLEM IN A FAIRLY CONVINCING DEPENDING ON WHO YOU TALK TO WAY IF YOU'D LIKE I CAN ELABORATE ON THESE SYMMETRIES AND HOW LAG OBEYS THEM THOUGH I'D ASK YOU TO TELL ME YOUR LEVEL OF MATHEMATICAL AND PHYSICAL SOPHISTICATION SO I CAN GIVE YOU AN ANSWER THAT MAKES SENSE TO YOU
LATTICE CD
CAUSAL SETS DON'T KNOW MUCH THEM BUT IT SOMETHING THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE WORKING ON
NUMBER SCHRDINGER LIKE EINSTEIN NEVER ACCEPTED QUANTUM MECHANICS AT ALL AND PREFERRED A DETERMINISTIC VIEW OF PHYSICS ALTHOUGH WITH SOME CAVEATS

THIS IS IRONIC BECAUSE QUANTUM THEORY WAS ORIGINALLY HIS THEORY HE PROPOSED THE WAVE EQUATION
SCHRÖNDIGER DERIVED HIS EQUATION FROM FORMAL ARGUMENTS BASED ON THE MATHEMATICAL CHARACTERISTICS THAT SUCH AN EQUATION WOULD HAVE TO OBEY THAT WAY HE FOUND AN EQUATION THAT COULD DESCRIBE THE EVOLUTION OF AN UNSPECIFIED WAVE FUNCTION WHICH HE NEVER REALLY GAVE ANY PHYSICAL MEANING THE COPENHAGEN INTERPRETATION ON THE OTHER HAND DEALS WITH THE PROCESS OF MEASUREMENT AND COLLAPSE OF THE WAVE FUNCTION WHICH IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM ITS TIME EVOLUTION AND IS NOT DESCRIBED BY EQUATION SO EVEN IF HE DISCOVERED THE WAY A WAVE BEHAVES WHICH IS AFTER ALL A SLIGHT VARIATION OF CLASSICAL MECHANICS HE DID NOT STUDY THE MUCH MORE BIZARRE PROCESS OF MEASUREMENT THE PHENOMENON WHICH THE COPENHAGEN INTERPRETATION TRIES TO EXPLAIN TO MY KNOWLEDGE HE DID NOT FIND ANY AVAILABLE INTERPRETATION CONVINCING HENCE HIS PROPOSAL OF THE CAT PARADOX
SCHROEDINGER

HIS NAME IS EITHER SCHRDINGER IN THE GERMAN ALPHABET OR SCHROEDINGER SCHRODINGER IN THE ENGLISH ALPHABET

E IS WRONG IN BOTH LANGUAGES
INDEED SOME THINK THE CAT EXPERIMENT SAYS THAT SCHROEDINGER BELIEVED THE CAT WOULD REALLY BE IN THIS STATE OF SUPERPOSITION WHEN IT JUST SHOWS THAT THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH HOW YOU GET TO THAT CONCLUSION
IS THIS GUY FOR REAL HE HAS NO IDEA HOW PATH INTEGRALS WORK IF HE THINKS HE CAN DEVIATE FROM THE BORN RULE USING THEM TOTAL GARBAGE

R ASKSCIENCE COMMENTS

CAN ANYBODY ANSWER HOW A PILOT WAVE THEORY DEALS WITH

SPIN AND THE SPIN STATISTICS THEOREM
THE KOCHER SPECKER THEOREM


THIS IS DEFINITELY A NICE WAY TO VISUALIZE QUANTUM BUT IT'S CONSTANTLY BEEN OVERHOPED IN THE MEDIA FOR YEARS AS REVOLUTIONIZING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF QUANTUM MECHANICS IT DOESN'T DO THAT
COMPLETE PHYSICS BOOB HERE WOULD THIS NOT BE SOMETHING LIKE A SYSTEM
BUT THEN WHAT IS THE WAVE MADE OUT OF IF SAY PHOTONS ARE PARTICLES RIDING THEIR OWN WAVE INTERACTION THEN WHAT IS THE MEDIUM OF THE WAVE IN A VACUUM
I'D SAY IT'S A PRETTY GOOD ANALOGY FOR BUT ONLY FOR SITUATIONS THAT DON'T INVOLVE VIOLATING BELL INEQUALITIES IT CAN DO THE EASY STUFF BUT NOT THE DEEP INTERESTING STUFF
HMMMMM I CAN'T SAY I PARTICULARLY LIKE THE IDEA OF SAYING THAT ANYTHING IN PHYSICS SHOULD COME DOWN TO WHAT WE'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DECIDING HOW BEST YOU PREFER TO THINK ABOUT PHYSICAL CONCEPTS AND DECIDING HOW THE UNIVERSE WORKS THE FIRST IS TOTALLY UP TO YOU THE OTHER IS BASED ON EVIDENCE
SO REGARDLESS OF THE MERITS OF PILOT WAVE THEORY THIS IS THE BEST DEMONSTRATION I'VE EVER SEEN OF WHAT PARTICLE WAVE BEHAVIOR ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE PARTICULARLY THE I'VE NEVER PICTURED A PARTICLE RIDING AROUND LIKE THAT FOLLOWING THE WAVE OUTWARD SEEING HOW A PARTICULAR PEAK OR VALLEY CAN MAKE THE PARTICLE VEER OFF MAKES IT EASY TO APPRECIATE HOW COMPLEX THAT MOTION CAN BECOME OVER TIME AND HOW SENSITIVE IT MUST BE TO THE PARTICLE'S STARTING POSITION

IT ALSO MAKES IT CLEAR WHY WAVEFORM INTERFERENCE AND DISTORTION BY PHYSICAL OBJECTS DOESN'T COUNT AS OBSERVATION SINCE THE NEW WAVEFORM CAN BE PERFECTLY KNOWABLE WITHOUT EXPOSING ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THE ACTUAL COURSE THE PARTICLE WILL TAKE

EVEN IF THE ACTUAL MECHANICS DON'T INVOLVE A WAVE SHOVING A DISTINCT PARTICLE AROUND IT'S A NICE CHANGE OF PACE TO BE ABLE TO CLEARLY SEE WHAT SORT OF ROUTE A PHOTON COULD ACTUALLY FOLLOW THOUGH THE AND WHAT DIFFERENCE THE INTERFERENCE PATTERN MAKES INSTEAD OF THE USUAL HAVING SOMEONE INSIST THAT DOESN'T MATTER AND THEN DRAWING A CLOUD ON A PIECE OF PAPER WITH A GIANT QUESTION MARK TO ILLUSTRATE THE CONCEPT

THE FIRST TIME I HEARD PHYSICISTS EXPLAINING THAT A PHOTON WOULD TAKE EVERY POSSIBLE ROUTE TO THEIR DESTINATION SIMULTANEOUSLY I WAS PICTURING THINGS LIKE PHOTONS POPPING IN AND OUT OF EXISTENCE SOME TAKING A SHORT BREAK TO DO DONUTS IN THE PARKING LOT AND SOME GOING BACK IN TIME TO KILL HITLER FAILING AND RETURNING JUST IN TIME TO SPLATTER ON A SCREEN THIS DEMONSTRATION CLEARLY SHOWS WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY DEALING WITH THAT WHILE COMPLEX ITS PATH IS PERFECTLY LOGICAL AND WE COULD EVEN PERFECTLY DETERMINE WHERE IT CAME FROM AND WHERE IT WAS GOING IF THE UNIVERSE WOULD GET OFF ITS HIGH HORSE JUST ONCE AND LET US PROPERLY MEASURE THE DAMN THING

THE FACT THAT PHOTONS CAN DO SPOOKY THINGS LIKE RETCONNING THEMSELVES AND PROBABLY DON'T ACTUALLY EXIST AS A PARTICLE UNTIL THE MOMENT THEY INTERACT WITH AN OBSERVER IS BESIDE THE POINT IF PEOPLE ARE STARTING OUT WITH NO EXPECTATION OF WHAT THEY SHOULD BE EXPECTING A PHOTON TO DO WHICH IS GOING TO BE THE CASE BECAUSE WE SKIPPED THAT PART AND JUMPED STRAIGHT IN TO WHY IT'S WRONG IF WE DID THAT WITH NEWTONIAN PHYSICS AND SKIPPED STRAIGHT TO GENERAL RELATIVITY MOST PEOPLE WOULD CONSIDER GRAVITY TO BE SOME MAGICAL CONCEPT THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY BE EXPECTED TO UNDERSTAND IN ANY PRACTICAL WAY JUST LIKE THEY DO WITH QUANTUM MECHANICS DEMONSTRATIONS LIKE THIS ARE FANTASTIC FOR CONNECTING THE DOTS AND DISPELLING THOSE MYTHS EVEN IF THEY CAN ONLY GO SO FAR BY THEMSELVES
THIS IS FANTASTIC
WE USUALLY WEAR OVERALLS AND USE TINY TOOLS TO STOP THEM WAVE FUNCTIONS FROM COLLAPSING
IT'S CUTE BUT HEY THERE'S PROBLEMS WITH IT DON'T TAKE THIS VISUALIZATION TOO SERIOUSLY

FIRST EACH PARTICLE HAS ITS OWN PILOT WAVE AND THOSE PILOT WAVES DON'T INTERACT WITH OTHER PARTICLES OR OTHER PILOT WAVES ALL ONE PILOT WAVE DOES IS CONDITION WHERE ITS PARTICLE ENDS UP

SECOND THE FORM OF THE PILOT WAVE IS NOT JUST A FUNCTION OF THE BOUNDARIES BUT ALSO A FUNCTION OF THE PARTICLES MOMENTUM MASS AND VELOCITY IT COMPLETELY CHANGES FORM WHEN THE MOMENTUM CHANGES AND THIS CHANGE IS INSTANTANEOUS OUT TO THE EDGE OF THE UNIVERSE

THIRD THE PHASE VELOCITY OF THE PILOT WAVE IS C SQUARED OVER V WHERE V IS THE SPEED OF THE PARTICLE I E FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT USUALLY MUCH FASTER

FOURTH DON'T EVEN TRY TO IMAGINE THE SHAPE OF A PILOT WAVE FOR A SYSTEM OF TWO PARTICLES OR MORE

FIFTH IT DOESN'T PREDICT ANYTHING MEASURABLE THAT IS NOT FOUND WITH THE COPENHAGEN INTERPRETATION
FASCINATING I DON'T TEND TO STUDY QUANTUM MECHANICS HOWEVER THIS HAS REALLY PEEKED MY INTEREST I LIKE THE WAVE IDEA IT'S WORTH MORE STUDY THANK YOU
I'D SUGGEST NOT GETTING A TATTOO YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ESPECIALLY A PHYSICS ONE

I'M ALL FOR BUT TRY FINDING SOMETHING THAT SUITS YOU THIS IS RUSHED AND YOU MIGHT REGRET IT LATER
IS YOUR DESIGN MEANT TO MEAN S BECAUSE THAT'S NOT TRUE THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS SAYS ROUGHLY THAT S IN THE FUTURE AFTER THE HEAT DEATH OF THE UNIVERSE THEN INDEED S BECAUSE NO PROCESSES WILL BE POSSIBLE

SO NEITHER S NOR S IS GOING TO INFINITY I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S WHAT YOUR DESIGN MEANT TO SHOW BUT MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T NONETHELESS I THINK A DESIGN INVOLVING THE SYMBOLS S AND AN ARROW THE ARROW OF TIME COULD STILL BE PRETTY GOOD BECAUSE THOSE ARE RELATED CONCEPTS AS LONG AS THEY ARE ARRANGED IN SUCH A WAY AS TO NOT IMPLY AN UNTRUE LIMIT
AN ARROW LIKE THOSE THAT PEOPLE USE ON BOWS I MIGHT BE MISTAKEN BUT I THINK THERE'S A THEORY USING THAT SAW ON THAT COSMOS SERIES NEIL TYSON VERSION THAT SOME CRAZY GREEK PROPOSED THIS THOUGHT EXPERIMENT IMAGINE AN ARCHER SHOOTING ONE ARROW IN A GIVEN DIRECTION THEN HE RECOVER THE ARROW AND SHOOT IT TO THE SAME DIRECTION AND DOES IT AGAIN AND AGAIN IT'S SOMETHING TO EXPLAIN INFINITY OF SPACE I THINK IT FITS WITH THE IMAGE YOU'RE THINKING

THE ARROW WOULD BE PIERCING BOTH BUT WITH NO DIRECT LINK
HAS ANYONE EVER TAKEN A YEAR OFF AFTER GETTING THEIR PHD

IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER YOU WENT BACK INTO ACADEMIA AFTERWARDS OR NOT I'D BE INTERESTING IN HEARING REGARDLESS I'D BE INTERESTED IN DETAILS ABOUT WHAT YOU DID IN THAT TIME WHETHER YOU'RE HAPPY ABOUT IT AND WHAT THE FINANCIAL SITUATION WAS IF YOU'RE WILLING TO GIVE THOSE DETAILS
A QUESTION TO THE EUROPEAN NON-AMERICAN PART OF THE COMMUNITY

I AM CURRENTLY A LAST YEAR MASTER STUDENT AND I AM LOOKING AT THE POSSIBILITIES OF CONTINUING WITH A PHD ANYWHERE IN EUROPE ESSENTIALLY NOW THERE IS A LOT OF ADVISE ON REDDIN CONCERNING THE AMERICAN MODEL OF DOING A UNDERGRAD DEGREE AND THEN GOING TO GRAD SCHOOL BUT AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND THIS DOESN'T REALLY WORK THE SAME WAY IN PARTS OF EUROPE I KNOW IN MY COUNTRY AT LEAST PHD POSITIONS ARE POSTED AS A NORMAL JOB LISTING NOW THIS LEADS IN TO THE ACTUAL QUESTION HOW DO YOU THEN FIND A RELEVANT PHD PROGRAM WHEN THE PROCESS ISN'T JUST TO APPLY FOR A GRAD SCHOOL PROGRAM AT A UNIVERSITY AND SEARCHING ACROSS SEVERAL COUNTRIES HOW DO YOU EVEN START LOOKING
ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS GENERALLY SPEAKING HOW DIFFICULT OR INTELLECTUALLY TAXING IS AN ENTRY CHEM ENGINEERING JOB WHEN COMPARED TO THE DIFFICULT CHALLENGES A STUDENT FACES NEARING HIS PH D
IM A 3RD YEAR BACHELOR STUDENT IN EAST GERMANY AND SOON ILL HAVE TO CHOOSE A SPECIALIZATION I CAN CHOOSE BETWEEN

STRUCTURE OF CONDENSED MATTER

ELECTRONIC PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS

APPLIED SOLID STATE PHYSICS AND PHOTONIC

PARTICLE AND NUCLEAR PHYSICS

SOFT CONDENSED MATTER AND BIOLOGICAL PHYSICS

THEORETICAL PHYSICS

ARE ANY OF THESE PARTICULARLY GOOD BAD IN TERMS OF FINDING A GOOD PAYING JOB AFTER A MASTERS DEGREE OR ARE THE DIFFERENCES SO MINUTE THAT I SHOULD JUST CHOOSE MY FAVORITE

WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY WHAT I WOULD PREFER BUT IF THE CHANCE TO GET A GOOD JOB IS MUCH WORSE FOR MY FIRST PICK COMPARED TO MY SECOND I MIGHT CHOOSE MY SECOND FAVORITE SPECIALIZATION
I'M A PHYSICS SENIOR AND I'M GOING TO START APPLYING FOR GRADUATE SCHOOL FOR MY RESEARCH BACKGROUND IS IN OPTICS AND I KNOW IF I MAKE THAT MY AIM IN GRADUATE ADMISSIONS MY CHANCES OF GETTING INTO A DESIRED SCHOOL ARE HIGHER BUT I STILL HAVE THESE OTHER AREAS OF RESEARCH UNEXPLORED AND I DON'T WANT TO IGNORE THAT

I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT TO DO

I WANT TO EXPLORE OTHER AREAS OF RESEARCH LIKE CONDENSED MATTER HEPP SOLID STATE AND SO FORTH BOTH THEORY AND EXPERIMENTAL BUT I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME AND THE MORE EXTENSIVE MY OPTICS BACKGROUND IS THE BETTER MY CHANCES ARE FOR AN AMO CENTERED DEPARTMENT

I UNDERSTAND GRADUATE SCHOOLS SHOULD BE CHOSEN ON THE DEPARTMENTS RESEARCH AND NOT THE PRESTIGE OF THE SCHOOL ITSELF BUT I DON'T WANT TO GO TO GRADUATE SCHOOL AND DO RESEARCH IN OPTICS WHEN I MUCH MORE ENJOYED CONDENSED MATTER THEORETICAL RESEARCH

HOW CAN I GO ABOUT GETTING INTO A GRAD SCHOOL I'D ENJOY WHILE NOT BEING STUCK WITH AN AREA OF RESEARCH THAT ISN'T THE MOST CAPTIVATING TO ME

AND WHO KNOWS MAYBE THERE'S A OF OPTICS THAT COULD REALLY ATTRACT ME I JUST DON'T KNOW YET AND I FEEL I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME

I'M A FRESHMAN PHYSICS MATHEMATICS DOUBLE MAJOR THOUGH PHYSICS IS DEFINITELY MY MAIN INTEREST MY UNIVERSITY HAS AN EXTREMELY GOOD MATH DEPARTMENT AND I'LL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE COURSES IF I WISH IN FUTURE YEARS

I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN PARTICLE PHYSICS PROBABLY THEORY WHICH OF THESE COURSES WOULD BE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS TO TAKE AT SOME POINT IN MY UNDERGRADUATE CAREER

SO FAR I'VE GATHERED THAT TAKING SOME ALGEBRA COURSES ADVANCED ADVANCED 2 AND LIE GROUPS ALGEBRA IN ADDITION TO DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY WOULD BE GOOD ARE THERE ANY OTHERS
IS GOING TO SCHOOL AN EXTRA YEAR MAYBE ONE SEMESTER WORTH IT FOR A BIOMEDICAL BS DEGREE I'M A CHEMISTRY BS MAJOR AND I'M ALSO TAKING MATH PHYSICS MINORS BUT SINCE I DON'T LIKE THE CHEMISTRY ELECTIVES THAT MY SCHOOL OFFERS I HAVE THE OPTION TO TAKE UPPER DIVISION PHYSICS COURSES INSTEAD AND DOING THAT I WOULD END UP WITH JUST UNITS SHY OF THE BIOMEDICAL DEGREE WHICH I COULD DO IN ONE SEMESTER BUT I'M ASKING IS IT WORTH IT IN TERMS OF GETTING A JOB AFTER SCHOOL I'M REALLY NOT LOOKING AT ANY GRAD OR MED SCHOOL AFTER I'M REALLY TIRED OF THIS BUT I KNOW I COULD DO JUST ONE MORE SEMESTER IF IT'S WORTH IT I TRIED LOOKING HERE FOR JOBS AROUND MY CITY WITHIN DRIVING DISTANCE SINCE THERE'S NO WAY I COULD MOVE OUT FOR OTHER REASONS BUT THERE'S ZERO HETP I'M THINKING IT'S BECAUSE IT'S NOT A STANDARD DEGREE LIKE BIOCHEM PHYSICS OR THOSE KIND SO I'D LIKE ANY OPINIONS YOU GUYS HAVE
I'M CURRENTLY A JUNIOR CHEMICAL ENGINEERING MAJOR AND I'M LOOKING TO PHYSICS GRAD SCHOOL BECAUSE I'M VERY DISSATISFIED WITH MY CLASSES THEY'RE BORING AND DON'T QUENCH MY HUNGER FOR UNDERSTANDING

IS IT POSSIBLE TO GO FROM CHEME UNDERGRAD TO PHYSICS PHD PROGRAM

IF IT HELPS I HAVE A GA AND I'M ALREADY HEAVILY INVOLVED IN RESEARCH WILL HAVE YEARS OF UNDERGRAD RESEARCH EXPERIENCE BY GRADUATION

I HAVE MY OWN RESEARCH PROJECT THAT IS GOING WELL AND WILL EVENTUALLY END UP IN ME PUBLISHING A HOPEFULLY HIGH IMPACT PAPER


THIS IS ALL MAINLY FOR ADMISSIONS QUESTIONS IN GENERAL DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY ADVICE FOR SOMEONE IN MY POSITION LOOKING AT GRAD SCHOOL
I RECENTLY CHANGED MY MAJOR TO ENGINEERING PHYSICS WITH A MINOR IN COMPUTER SCIENCE WHAT SORT OF JOBS AND CAREERS CAN I GET INTO WITH THIS

IF YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE ADVICE FROM A GUY THAT WENT TO COLLEGE FOR YEARS THEN YEAH GO FOR IT GET YOUR PHYSICS DEGREE LIKE I FINALLY DID OF COURSE BACK THEN SCHOOL WAS A LOT CHEAPER STARTED OFF PAYING ABOUT SEMESTER AND FINISHED UP AT MAYBE PER THIS WAS YEARS AGO

I ACTUALLY BEGAN MY UNIVERSITY STUDIES INTENDING TO PURSUE A PHYSICS DEGREE EVEN THOUGH EVERYONE ELSE WANTED ME TO TAKE MATHEMATICS OBE PROBLEM WAS THAT I WENT TO A LOCAL SCHOOL AND CONTINUED TO HANG WITH MY HIGH-SCHOOL FRIENDS MOST OF WHOM WERE AND PETTY CRIMINALS JUST SHOWING UP FOR THE TESTS WHICH WORKED FINE IN HS DIDN'T WORK IN MY MATH AND PHYSICS CLASSES AND I ENDED UP ON AND OFF ACADEMIC PROBATION FOR MY FIRST FEW YEARS

GAVE UP ON PHYSICS AT THIS POINT AND STARTED TAKING PSYCHOLOGY CLASSES CAME WITHIN TWO COURSES OF A PSYCH BACHELOR'S BUT SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE HAD A PSYCH PROF WITH A PHYSICS DEGREE WHO CONVINCED ME TO TRY THAT ROUTE AGAIN THIS TIME I WENT TO CLASS APPLIED MYSELF AND FINALLY STARTED TO HAVE SOME SUCCESS IN PHYSICS AND MATH CLASSES SO YEARS IN I GOT MY PHYSICS BS MY LAST THREE SEMESTERS WERE PROGRESSIVELY MY BEST AS AN UNDERGRAD DEAN'S LIST AND ALL THAT AND I ENDED UP WITH A GA

THE ONLY JOB I WAS OFFERED AT GRADUATION WAS BUILDING ORDINANCE FOR THE NAVY SO I DECIDED TO GO BACK TO GRAD SCHOOL AT THE SAME STATE COLLEGE I GOT MY BS AT FORCED MYSELF TO GO TO EVERY LECTURE AND KEEP UP WITH THE WORK AND ENDED UP THE TOP STUDENT IN THE DEPARTMENT WITH STRAIGHT AS IN UNITS OF GRAD PHYSICS COURSEWORK FIVE YEARS INTO THIS DECIDED TO ACCEPT OF PROFESSIONAL POSITION WHILE I FINISHED BY THESIS

THE THESIS NEVER GOT FINISHED FOR VARIOUS CONVOLUTED REASONS BUT THE CAREER HAS WORKED OUT GREAT WITHOUT IT MY BUDDY WHO HELPED ME GET THAT FIRST JOB DID FINISH HIS PHYSICS PHASIS AND ENDED UP GETTING A BONUS AT WORK FOR IT AS NEAR AS I CAN FIGURE THAT MUST BE ABOUT WHAT IT WAS WORTH ALTHOUGH I STILL MAKE A BETTER SALARY THAN HE DOES I'M HAPPILY NAVIGATING SPACECRAFT AROUND THE SOLAR SYSTEM FOR NASA NOW AND IT BEATS THE HELL OUT OF WORKING AT A REAL JOB IF YOU'RE DOING WHAT YOU ENJOY THEN ITS NOT REALLY WORK IS IT
I ENJOY READING ABOUT IT BOTH IN PRACTICE AND IN THEORY

I WOULD TRY TO FIGURE OUT IF YOU LIKE DOING IT IN PRACTICE AND THEORY BEFORE COMMITTING TO ANYTHING ARE YOU PREVENTED FROM TAKING ANY PHYSICS CLASSES IN YOUR CURRENT MAJOR
YOUR QUESTIONS ARE WELCOME BUT ON THURSDAY WE HAVE OUR EDUCATION AND CAREER QUESTIONS THREAD WHERE YOU MAY GET A BETTER RESPONSE

I DON'T THINK YOUR PROGRESS TOWARDS AN ARCHITECTURE DEGREE WILL COUNT MUCH TOWARDS A PHYSICS DEGREE YOU COULD MAYBE WORK TOWARDS A CIVIL ENGINEERING DEGREE AND THEN APPLY FOR PHYSICS MASTERS PROGRAMS
I CAN TAKE WHICHEVER CLASSES I'D LIKE TO I'VE TAKEN INTRO PHYSICS AND WASN'T A HUGE FAN BUT I READ THAT IT WAS A WEED OUT CLASS AND WAS DESIGNED TO BE DIFFICULT IN MANY CASES BEYOND THAT I'M IGNORANT OF THE SCHOOLING
I'M AND WITH UNFINISHED DEGREE IN PHYSICS IF YOU DO MENTAL CEREBRAL THINGS DAILY THEN YOU CAN LEARN PHYSICS AT ALMOST ANY AGE
HOW IS YOUR MATHEMATICS

ENGINEERING IS MORE GLOBALLY PRACTICAL
OH NEAT MY SENIOR THESIS WAS ON LASERS UNFORTUNATELY I JUST WOKE UP SO I'M GOING TO HAVE TO COME BACK AND EDIT THIS THROUGHOUT THE DAY TO INCLUDE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE LIST

FIRST I'LL SAY YOU SHOULD SEARCH ARTICLES FOR MICROMACHINING IT'S WHERE ABLATION IS USED TO MANIPULATE SMALL BITS OF MATTER AND CAN OPEN UP A LOT MORE INFORMATION PARTICULARLY RESEARCH ARTICLES ON THE TOPIC THAN JUST SEARCHING FOR ABLATION

ALSO WHILE IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING DIRECTLY ON ABLATION YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE BYU OPTICS TEXTBOOK WHICH IS GOOD BOOK IN GENERAL THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR FREE DOWNLOAD ON THEIR WEBSITE

I DO KNOW A FEW GOOD RESEARCH ARTICLES BUT IT'LL TAKE ME SOME TIME TO SORT THROUGH THE RELEVANT ONES THAT ARE ALSO FREELY AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC READING LIKE I SAID I'LL WORK MORE ON THIS COMMENT THROUGHOUT THE DAY SO STAY TUNED
THIS IS THE BEST TL R I COULD MAKE ORIGINAL REDUCED BY I'M A BOT

MATTHEW FISHER A PHYSICIST AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA RAISED EYEBROWS LATE LAST YEAR WHEN HE PUBLISHED A PAPER IN ANNALS OF PHYSICS PROPOSING THAT THE NUCLEAR SPINS OF PHOSPHORUS ATOMS COULD SERVE AS RUDIMENTARY CUBITS IN THE BRAIN WHICH WOULD ESSENTIALLY ENABLE THE BRAIN TO FUNCTION LIKE A QUANTUM COMPUTER

NOTION OF QUANTUM PROCESSING IN THE BRAIN BROADLY FITS INTO THIS EMERGING FIELD OF QUANTUM BIOLOGY

OVER THE COURSE OF HIS FIVE-YEAR QUEST FISHER HAS IDENTIFIED JUST ONE CREDIBLE CANDIDATE FOR STORING QUANTUM INFORMATION IN THE BRAIN PHOSPHORUS ATOMS WHICH ARE THE ONLY COMMON BIOLOGICAL ELEMENT OTHER THAN HYDROGEN WITH A SPIN OF A LOW NUMBER THAT MAKES POSSIBLE LONGER COHERENCE TIMES



EXTENDED SUMMARY FAQ VERSION TL RS SO FAR THEORY FEEDBACK AND COMMENTS ARE MONITORED CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK IS WELCOME TOP KEYWORDS QUANTUM FISHER 2 SPIN BRAIN ATOM
ORIGINAL PAPER HERE
AN ANSWER THAT CAN'T BE GIVEN AS OF TODAY WE ONLY KNOW HOW IT WORKS BUT NOT WHY
ANY MASSLESS PARTICLE WITH SPIN 2 MUST BE EMITTED AND ABSORBED EQUALLY BY ALL OTHER KINDS OF PARTICLES WITH A STRENGTH DEPENDENT ON THEIR ENERGY AND THIS PRODUCES A GRAVITATIONAL FIELD THAT ATTRACTS OBJECTS TOGETHER AND FOR MOST OBJECTS MOST OF THEIR ENERGY IS DUE TO THEIR MASS VIA E MC 2

THE FACT THAT IT AFFECTS ALL PARTICLES AND THEY ALL FALL AT THE SAME RATE GIVEN THE SAME GRAVITATIONAL FIELD MEANS THAT WE CAN ALSO CONSIDER THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD TO BE PART OF THE SHAPE OF SPACETIME ITSELF BECAUSE YOU CAN TAKE SOME SMALL REGION OF SPACE AND SUBTRACT OUT THE SAME GRAVITATIONAL ACCELERATION ON ALL THE PARTICLES AND IT LOOKS JUST LIKE THERE ISN'T ANY GRAVITY AT THAT POINT SO JUST LIKE ANY POINT ON A SPHERE LOOKS FLAT IF YOU ZOOM IN ENOUGH EVERY POINT IN SPACE CAN BE SEEN AS HAVING NO GRAVITY TECHNICAL TERM IS A MANIFOLD BUT THE SPACE AND TIME AXES ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN THE REGIONS OF SPACE NEARBY AND THIS IS KNOWN AS SPACETIME CURVATURE

AN OBJECT WILL MOVE THROUGH EACH SMALL REGION OF SPACE WITH A CONSTANT SPEED AND DIRECTION JUST LIKE 1ST LAW OF MOTION BUT THE SPEED WILL BE DIFFERENT WHEN IT MOVES TO A DIFFERENT REGION OF SPACE DUE TO THE CURVATURE THE PATH IT TRACES OUT IS CALLED A SPACETIME GEODESIC AND IT'S THE PATH FOLLOWED BY ANY OBJECT IN FREE FALL NO FORCES ON IT OTHER THAN GRAVITY LIKE A FALLING APPLE OR AN ORBITING PLANET

THE EXISTENCE OF PARTICLES OF MASS AND SPIN 2 GRAVITONS IS ONE OF THE FEW OPTIONS AVAILABLE IN QUANTUM FIELD THEORY AND THE EXISTENCE OF PARTICLES WITH MASS AND SPIN IS DUE TO HAVING A QUANTUM STATE THAT IS SYMMETRIC UNDER ROTATIONS IN SPACE AND TIME MASS MEANS THE GRAVITONS MOVE AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT SPIN 2 MEANS THEY ARE SYMMETRIC WHEN ROTATED BY O WHICH IS RELATED TO THE FACT THAT THEY CAUSE AN ATTRACTIVE FORCE
DON MANUEL IS CORRECT BUT HERE IS A GOOD REFERENCE TO HELP PUT THE CONCEPT INTO CLEARER VIEW SEE SECTION FOR MORE DETAIL

ANY WHY EXPLANATION HAS TO TAKE SOMETHING FOR GRANTED SCIENCE IS ABOUT DESCRIBING THE MINIMAL STARTING POINTS FOR THESE WHY QUESTIONS GRAVITY IS ONE OF THE FOUR FUNDAMENTAL FORCES MEANING IT'S WHERE THE STARTING POINT FOR WHY QUESTIONS IS

THE BEST ONE LINE DESCRIPTION OF WHAT GRAVITY IS IS DUE TO WHEELER
MASS TELLS SPACE-TIME HOW TO CURVE AND SPACE-TIME TELLS MASS HOW TO MOVE
ALRIGHT THIS VIDEO DOES THE BEST JOB I HAVE SEEN DESCRIBING THE CONNECTION BETWEEN GR AND GRAVITY YES THERE IS NO GRAVITATIONAL FORCE IN GR INSTEAD GRAVITY IS AN ARTIFACT OF EXISTING INSIDE AN ACCELERATED FRAME OF REFERENCE DUE TO CURVED SPACE TIME NOW THIS MAY ONLY GIVE YOU MORE QUESTIONS BUT ON THE OTHER HAND YOU MIGHT COME OUT OF IT UNDERSTANDING A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THE UNIVERSE AROUND US

EDIT IF YOU LIKE THIS KIND OF STUFF PBS SPACE TIME IS ONE OF THE GREATEST SERIES OUT THERE FOR EXPLAINING COMPLICATED ASTROPHYSICAL CONCEPTS
THE SHORT ANSWER IS WE DON'T REALLY KNOW YET
YOUR MOM
HERBAL SCIENTIST HERE WELL RAVIOLI OFCOURSE
WOW OKAY THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR YOUR ANSWERS I UNDERSTOOD AT LEAST PARTS OF ALL OF THEM I THINK THE WHY QUESTION HOLE I SEEM TO BE DIGGING AT JUST SEEMS TO GO DOWN TO DEEP DARK UNEXPLAINED PLACES BUT THANKS FOR SHEDDING SOME LIGHT ON AT LEAST PART OF THE TUNNEL I'M GONNA DO MY BEST TO GO THROUGH ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS SOON SO EXPECT FURTHER QUESTIONS
THANKS AGAIN
EINSTEIN SAID THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A GRAVITATIONAL FORCE MASS IS NOT ATTRACTING MASS OVER A DISTANCE INSTEAD IT'S CURVING SPACETIME
THINGS ARE JUST FALLING INTO EACH OTHER
SOMEONE CORRECT ME BUT ISN'T IT BECAUSE OF AN OBJECT'S MASS
QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT
A VERY HOT IDEA NOWADAYS IS THAT GRAVITY IS A MANIFESTATION OF QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT THE HOLOGRAPHIC PRINCIPLE HAS LED TO SOME BIG DEVELOPMENTS IN RECENT YEARS MOST SIGNIFICANTLY THE ADS AFT CONJECTURE WHICH POSITS THAT SPACETIME WITH GRAVITY ARE DUAL TO I EAST EQUIVALENT TO QUANTUM FIELD THEORIES THAT LIVE IN ONE FEWER DIMENSION THOUGH THE CORRESPONDENCE IS UNPROVEN IT HAS BEEN VERIFIED IN MANY TOY MODELS AND HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED IN CONDENSED MATTER SYSTEMS LIKED THE HOLOGRAPHIC SUPERCONDUCTOR

ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO NYU AND TAKAYANGI DISCOVERED A VERY IMPORTANT LINK BETWEEN THE DUAL THEORIES SPECIFICALLY THE ENTANGLEMENT ENTROPY IN THE QUANTUM FIELD THEORY CAN BE CALCULATED FROM THE AREA OF A SURFACE IN THE GRAVITATIONAL SPACETIME PEOPLE ARE NOW TRYING TO REVERSE ENGINEER THIS I EAST IF I START WITH A QUANTUM FIELD THEORY WITH A CERTAIN CONFIGURATION OF STATES AND THEREFORE A KNOWN ENTROPY CAN I CONSTRUCT A DUAL SPACETIME

THIS IDEA IS STILL VERY YOUNG AND HAS NOT YET BEEN CONNECTED WITH ANYTHING VERY CLOSE TO REALITY HOWEVER IF DEVELOPED FURTHER IT COULD HELP TO EXPLAIN WHAT GRAVITY IS BY CONNECTING IT WITH THE PROPERTY OF ENTANGLEMENT A TECHNICAL SUMMARY CAN BE FOUND IN A OLD REVIEW HERE I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND AN ELI DESCRIPTION
GRAVITY IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SUBJECTS IN THE ANCIENT TIMES ONE HYPOTHESIS WAS THAT AN OBJECT THAT YOU DROP WANTS TO REACH A CERTAIN PLACE THAT IS WHY IT MOVED TO THIS PLACE AND THEN CAME TO REST

GRAVITY SEEN AS A FORCE BEHAVES A LITTLE FUNNY IT ATTRACTS HEAVIER THINGS MORE THAN LIGHT THINGS THIS WASN'T GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD IN ANCIENT TIMES IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT A HEAVY OBJECT WOULD FALL FASTER THAN A LIGHT OBJECT AND EXPERIMENTING WAS NOT A COMMON PRACTICE

WAS IT NEWTON THAT FIRST UNDERSTOOD IN DETAIL AND COULD FORMULATE THE MATHEMATICS BEHIND IT THERE ARE SOME FUNNY THINGS HERE IF YOU DROP A CANON BALL IT'LL TAKE ABOUT ONE SECOND TO HIT THE GROUND IF YOU SHOOT A CANON BALL EXACTLY HORIZONTAL IT WILL STILL TAKE ONE SECOND TO HIT THE GROUND IF YOU DISREGARD UNEVEN TERRAIN AND ASSUME A PLAT GROUND THAT CAN BE UNDERSTOOD FAIRLY EASY BUT IF YOU SHOOT A LASER EXACTLY HORIZONTAL IT WILL STILL TAKE ONE SECOND TO HIT THE GROUND GIVEN THE SAME ASSUMPTIONS THE FUNNY THING IS THAT LIGHT HAVE NO MASS AND STILL GRAVITATIONAL FORCE BENDS IT

IN THE ANCIENT TIMES AN OBJECT AT REST WAS DEFINED AS WHEN IT IT STOPPED MOVING THAT WAS THE NATURAL STATE AND APPLIED TO EVERYTHING NEWTON REALIZED THAT IT WOULD CONTINUE TO MOVE UNLESS THERE IS A FORCE APPLIED VELOCITY WOULD STAY THE SAME UNLESS A FORCE IS APPLIED GRAVITY WAS SEEN AS A FORCE WHICH EXPLAINED WHY A FALLING APPLE ACCELERATED TOWARDS THE GROUND

WITH EINSTEIN SOME OF THIS WAS TURNED AROUND IF GRAVITY IS NOT A FORCE THEN A FALLING APPLE DOES NOT ACCELERATE TOWARDS THE GROUND IT IS THE OBSERVERS STANDING ON THE GROUND THAT ACCELERATE THAT IS WHY THEY FEEL THE PUSH FROM THE GROUND

A THING I CAN'T UNDERSTAND FORCES OF NATURE SEEM TO BE MEDIATED BY PARTICLES BUT THERE HAS BEEN NO SUCH PARTICLE IDENTIFIED FOR GRAVITATION GRAVITON BUT IF GRAVITATION IS REALLY CURVED SPACE AND NOT A FORCE COULDN'T IT BE THE CASE THAT THERE IS NO PARTICLE INVOLVED

I PROBABLY JUMBLED SOME CONCEPTS HERE FEEL FREE TO CORRECT ME

JUST WONDERING WHAT INHERENTLY CAUSES THE ATTRACTION OF OBJECTS TO ONE ANOTHER

GRAVITY DOESN'T ONLY HAVE AN EFFECT ON OBJECTS IT WILL EFFECT ANY FRAME OF REFERENCE
A VERY SIMPLE DESCRIPTION I LIKE IS THAT MOST THINGS IN THE UNIVERSE WANT TO HAVE A POTENTIAL ENERGY OF WHEN YOU'RE MILES ABOVE THE EARTH YOU HAVE A HUUUGE POTENTIAL ENERGY BUT WHEN YOURE ON THE SURFACE YOUR POTENTIAL ENERGY IS RELATIVE TO EARTH
INHERENTLY

SPECIAL RELATIVITY SAYS GRAVITY IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE UNEVEN DISTRIBUTION OF MASS AND ENERGY IN THE UNIVERSE

BUT THEN CONSEQUENCES ARE DIFFERENT FROM AN INSEPARABLE ATTRIBUTES


SOMETHING TO DO WITH PARTICLES THAT ARE AFFECTED BY THE UNIFORM HIGGS FIELD THAT GIVE THEM MASS AND CAUSE THEM TO INTERFERE WITH OTHER PARTICLES THAT HAVE MASSACHUSETTS I'M SURE THE R ASKSCIENCE GUYS COULD BE MORE TECHNICAL
THIS PROOF IS BASICALLY THE SAME AS THE USUAL ONE THE FACT THAT THE LAST EXPRESSION EQUALS ZERO FOLLOWS FROM THE SAME REASONING AS THE USUAL PROOF BY CONTRADICTION SO THIS PROOF IS JUST A VAGUER VERSION OF THE USUAL ONE
NOT PHYSICS BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS COOL ENOUGH TO PUT HERE ANYWAY
OR JUST SAY THAT ASSUMING THERE ARE JUST N PRIME NUMBERS PN THEN
P2 PN IS LARGER THAN ALL THE PRIMES AND YET INDIVISIBLE BY ANY ONE OF THEM SINCE DIVIDING BY ANY PRIME PRODUCES THE REMAINDER RATHER THAN THEREFORE IT'S PRIME ITSELF QED
THERE MUST BE SOME P THAT DIVIDES

WHY

EDIT OKAY SUPPOSE THERE IS NO SUCH P THEN IS PRIME WHICH CONTRADICTS THAT P IS THE PRODUCT OF ALL PRIMES
I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND DOESN'T ENTROPY SPONTANEOUSLY DECREASE IN THE SHORT TERM IN CLASSICAL SYSTEMS ANYWAY ALSO HOW WOULD A QUANTUM DEMON SUCCEED WHERE A CLASSICAL ONE FAILED
WELL SURE IF IT'S LOCAL ENOUGH YOU CAN OF COURSE CIRCUMVENT IT SINCE IT'S STATISTICAL IN NATURE
LAYS OUT A POSSIBLE AVENUE TO A SITUATION WHERE THE SECOND LAW IS VIOLATED ON THE MICROSCOPIC LEVEL

WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN TRUE SINCE THE SECOND LAW IS A LAW OF LARGE SCALE AND OR LONG TERM STATISTICAL AVERAGES SAYING YOU CAN VIOLATE IT AT THE MICROSCOPIC LEVEL IS LIKE SAYING I CAN FLIP TEN HEADS IN A ROW SURE I CAN BUT ON AVERAGE YOU'RE GOING TO GET NEARLY AS MANY HEADS AS TAILS
THIS IS WHY PHILOSOPHY IS USELESS
BY THE END OF THE RUN WE WERE REGULARLY OPERATING AT ABOVE THAT

WITH A RECORD ABOVE THE DESIGN VALUE DESPITE A LOWER NUMBER OF COLLIDING BUNCHES THE MACHINE EXCEEDED MANY OF ITS DESIGN VALUES AN AMAZING JOB BY THE MACHINE OPERATORS AND EVERYONE ELSE INVOLVED IN KEEPING THE MACHINE RUNNING
OFF TOPIC BUT I LIKE HOW THEY CLEVERLY SET UP THE CSS TO MAKE IT SO YOU CAN'T SELECT THE OPINION PART OF THE HEADLINE SO PEOPLE WON'T ACCIDENTALLY IT THEM HAVING THEIR OWN LD IS ALSO COOL

I HAD IT SHOW UP IN ANOTHER WEIRD PLACE IF YOU HAVE A BUOY SITTING IN WAVES ATTACHED TO A SPRING AND A MASS AT THE BOTTOM THAT YOU WANT AT A CERTAIN DEPTH AND THE WAVES ARE ROLLING BY AT A CERTAIN ANGULAR FREQUENCY AND AMPLITUDE AND STUFF AND YOU SET UP ALL THE DIFFERENTIAL AND SOLVE FOR THE SPRING CONSTANT THAT WILL KEEP THE MASS AS STATIONARY AS POSSIBLE AND YOU SET ALL THE POSSIBLE VARIABLES TO BE EQUAL TO THEN THE SPRING CONSTANT YOU GET IS THE GOLDEN RATIO WTF
THANK YOU IT'S INFORMATION LIKE THIS THAT MAKES THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE
AWESOME
THE COEFFICIENTS ARE USED IN COUPLING ANGULAR MOMENTA SO THEY SHOW UP WHEN YOU TAKE MATRIX ELEMENTS WHICH GIVE YOU THE PROBABILITIES OF CERTAIN PROCESSES HAPPENING

IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN HOW TO READ A TABLE OVER TEXT BUT DO YOU KNOW HOW TO COUPLE ANGULAR MOMENTA

IF I ASKED YOU TO ADD TWO SPINS OF WHAT WOULD THE BASIS STATES BE IN BOTH THE COUPLED AND UNCOUPLED BASES
ARE YOU USING A TEXT IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER TO EXPLAIN IF WE CAN POINT YOU TO EXPLANATIONS INSTEAD OF THE WHEEL

ALSO YOU MUST COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND CG COEFFICIENTS IN THE CONTEXT OF ADDITION OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM BEFORE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND IT IN CONTEXT OF PARTICLE DECAY SEE AN INTRO QM TEXT LIKE GRIFFITHS FOR THAT OR EVEN WIKIPEDIA SEE ALSO THE THEOREM

IF I UNDERSTAND YOU CORRECTLY YOU'RE NOT ASKING ABOUT ANGULAR MOMENTUM BUT THE INTERNAL ISOSPIN SYMMETRY
I LIKE THE IDEA OF ANIONS AND I LIKE THE MACHINES THAT TRY TO DETECT THEM MAYBE THEY'LL EVEN BE REAL
YOU LEARN MOST OF DATA ANALYSIS BY JUST DOING IT SINCE IT IS VERY SPECIALIZED TYPICALLY YOU START WORKING WITH EXPERIENCED COLLEAGUES WHO TEACH YOU THE TOOLS OF THE TRADE AND THEN GO FROM THERE SINCE YOU ARE GOING INTO ASTRONOMY THERE'S IRAF ET AL FOR OPTICAL ANALYSIS AIPS OR CASA FOR RADIO ASTRONOMY HEASOFT CIAO ISIS FOR X-RAY ANALYSIS AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER SOFTWARE PACKAGES PLUS A LOT OF SPECIALIZED SOFTWARE FOR THE DATA REDUCTION STEPS WHICH YOU LEARN BY A READING THE USER'S MANUALS AND B WORKING WITH OTHERS

ONCE YOU HAVE THE FIRST ANALYSIS DONE YOU WILL THEN NEED TO DO A LOT OF STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLOTTING AND SO ON WHAT YOU USE THERE REALLY DEPENDS ON THE ENVIRONMENT YOU'RE WORKING IN MANY PEOPLE THESE DAYS USE PYTHON JUST BECAUSE IT IS THE THING OF THIS DECADE BUT ANY OF THE OTHER SOFTWARE PACKAGES THAT PEOPLE USE WILL DO AS WELL THE REALLY IMPORTANT THING HERE IS TO ALSO HAVE A WELL FUNDED BACKGROUND IN THE STATISTICS AND MATHEMATICS OF DATA ANALYSIS I EAST DO NOT JUST USE THE PACKAGES BUT UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE DOING GOOD STARTERS HERE FOR PEOPLE IN THE PHYSICAL FIELDS IS THE CLASSIC BY BEVINGTON AND ROBINSON DATA ANALYSIS FOR THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES WHICH I CONSIDER A MUST READ ONCE YOU'VE GRAPPLED THE CONCEPTS THERE GO AND READ SOME OF THE MORE MODERN BOOKS ON DATA ANALYSIS FOR ASTRONOMY BAYESIAN LOGICAL DATA ANALYSIS FOR THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES IS A GOOD STARTER YES THIS BOOK IS USING MATHEMATIC BUT DO NOT FORGET THAT KNOWING THE CONCEPTS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE LANGUAGE YOU'RE USING

I'LL ANSWER FROM A NUCLEAR PHYSICS PERSPECTIVE BUT WHAT I SAY WILL PROBABLY APPLY WELL TO HEP EXPERIMENT TOO

FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DO A LOT OF DATA ANALYSIS IN YOUR WORK RESEARCH WHAT DO YOU DO AND WHAT TOOLS SOFTWARE DO YOU USE

ROOT FOR ANALYSIS AND BEANT FOR SIMULATIONS

HAVE YOU READ ANY BOOKS ON THE SUBJECT AND OR HOW DID YOU START LEARNING

IT'S HARD TO ASSIGN ONE SINGLE SUBJECT TO DATA ANALYSIS I'VE READ MULTIPLE BOOKS WHICH ARE RELEVANT TO WHAT I DO WHEN DOING ANALYSIS FOR STARTERS I'D RECOMMEND THE C TEXTBOOK BY AFORE IF YOU ARE NOT ALREADY PRETTY FAMILIAR WITH PROGRAMMING I'D RECOMMEND THE STATISTICS BOOK BY COWAN FOR AN INTRODUCTION TO THE MATHEMATICAL STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES APPLIED IN DATA ANALYSIS

BUT BOOKS ASIDE THE WAY TO LEARN IS TO START DOING IT IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU LEARN OVERNIGHT IT'S SOMETHING YOU LEARN AS YOU GO YOU NEVER REALLY STOP LEARNING THINGS
DEFINITELY VERY DIFFERENT FROM AREA TO AREA I CAN'T HELP YOU WITH THE ASTRO STUFF BUT I WOULD GREATLY SUGGEST LEARNING A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE OR TWO MAYBE PYTHON OR MATALAN AND C THESE CAN REALLY MAKE YOUR LIFE SO MUCH EASIER LATER YOU'LL NEVER DO ANYTHING MORE THAN ONCE MANUALLY EVER AGAIN HAHA
I FIND DATA ANALYSIS TO BE VAGUE DIFFERENT CALCULATIONS NEED TO BE DONE IN DIFFERENT PROJECTS
MATERIAL SCIENCE
IT DEPENDS TO A DEGREE ON WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WITHIN AEROSPACE ENGINEERING BUT I WOULD PROBABLY SAY MATERIAL SCIENCE WOULD BE MOST USEFUL THEN MATH ESPECIALLY IF YOUR MATH PROGRAM HAS A MORE APPLIED FOCUS FOR THE MINOR DEPENDS ON THE INSTITUTION I DON'T SEE HOW AN ASTRO MINOR WOULD DO THAT MUCH FOR YOU
I'LL GO OUT ON A LIMB AND SAY DO WHAT YOU WANT I WOULDN'T LOOK AND SEE WHICH ONE IS BEST FOR GRAD SCHOOL BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THEY REALLY CARE MY SUGGESTION IS TO FIND SOMETHING YOU ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT AND PUT TIME AND COMMITMENT INTO THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A MINOR
JUST ASK OLDER STUDENTS WHAT KIND OF QUESTIONS TO EXPECT IN THE EXAMINATION
WHERE I STUDIED IN GERMANY SO NO IDEA IF THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES THE STUDENT ASSOCIATION HAD A WEBSITE WHERE THEY UPLOADED OLD EXAMS ONLY LOOKING AT THOSE AND LEARNING THE ANSWERS WILL USUALLY NOT HELP HOWEVER COMBINING YOUR STUDYING OF THE CONCEPTS WITH A LOOK AT TYPICAL EXAM QUESTIONS SHOULD YIELD QUITE GOOD RESULTS

IT'S BASICALLY HOW I STUDIED FOR ALL MY EXAMS REDO ALL EXERCISES READ THE RECOMMENDED BOOK AT LEAST SUPERFICIALLY AND LOOK AT OLD EXAMS TO GET A FEELING FOR THE KIND OF QUESTIONS TO EXPECT
FOR SIMPLE STUFF I USE INSCAPE IT'S A BASIC VECTOR GRAPHICS PROGRAM THAT YOU CAN DOWNLOAD FOR FREE IT HAS A BIT OF A LEARNING CURVE BUT CAN PRODUCE REALLY PROFESSIONAL LOOKING DIAGRAMS

I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT JUST USE POWERPOINT THOUGH AND ITS POSSIBLE TO MAKE THAT LOOK REALLY GOOD TOO DEPENDING ON THE APPLICATION

FOR ADVANCED 3D MODELLING PEOPLE GENERALLY USE SOLID WORKS
INSCAPE IS ALMOST OBLIGATED BECAUSE IT ALLOWS FOR INTEGRATION OF LATEX CODE

AND TIKE BUT THAT'S BLACK MAGIC
MISPAINT
I LIKE TO JUST USE BECAUSE ITS SUPER SIMPLE TO USE AND HAS ALL THE FUNCTIONALITY THAT YOU CAN EVER WANT BUT IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT HAS TO HAVE ACCURATE PROPORTIONS OR MORE COMPLICATED DESIGNS I WOULD JUST USE LIBRECAD OR INSCAPE
SECONDING INSCAPE
EDIT THERE'S DIA IF YOU WANT SOMETHING SIMPLER
BLENDER 3D FOR 3D GRAPHICS IT'S NICE BECAUSE OF THE PYTHON INTEGRATION I HAVE WRITTEN A SCRIPT WHERE I ONLY NEED TO PROVIDE THE BASIS OF A CRYSTAL LATTICE AND BLENDER WILL GENERATE A NICE CRYSTAL STRUCTURE MODEL FOR ME

PYTHON WITH MATPLOTLIB FOR MOST OF MY CUSTOM 2D GRAPHS

AND IGOR PRO FOR APES PLOTS SIMPLY BECAUSE ALL THE DATA EVALUATION IS DONE WITH IT ANYWAY
ROOT OTHERWISE JUST C WITH GRAPHICS LIBRARY
IPE
MY INSTITUTION HAS A SUBSCRIPTION TO CORELDRAW SO I USUALLY USE THAT INSCAPE IS ALSO A GOOD OPTION BOTH HAVE PLUGGING FOR TYPESETTING LATEX FORMULAS ALTHOUGH THE CORELDRAW PUGIN DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK THAT WELL

SOMETHING I'VE NEVER QUITE UNDERSTOOD HOW DO THEY COME UP WITH CANDIDATE MATERIALS TO TEST FOR SUPERCONDUCTIVITY I MEAN I CAN'T IMAGINE IT'S GUESSING AT RANDOM BUT AT THE SAME TIME THIS INTERFACING TECHNIQUE WAS PROPOSED BACK IN THE S AND IT'S TAKEN THIS LONG TO FIND A MATERIAL WHICH DEMONSTRATES IT IS THERE SOME WAY TO TELL ON PAPER WHETHER A MATERIAL IS GOING TO EXHIBIT SUPERCONDUCTIVITY OR IS IT JUST LOTS AND LOTS OF TRIAL AND ERROR
THERE ARE ENTIRE SUBFIELDS OF MESOSCOPIC PHYSICS DEDICATED TO INDUCED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY THE TITLE AND ARTICLE IS RATHER MISLEADING

HEAVY BROWN DWARFS ARE SUPPORTED BY ELECTRON DEGENERACY PRESSURE ELECTRONS ARE FERMIONS WHICH MEANS TWO ELECTRONS CANNOT BE IN THE SAME STATE A HIGHER DENSITY MEANS MORE STATES HAVE TO BE OCCUPIED WHICH NEEDS MORE ENERGY IN OTHER WORDS EXPANSION WOULD RELEASE ENERGY A PRESSURE GRAVITATIONAL FORCES LEAD TO THE FORCE NECESSARY TO KEEP THE ELECTRONS PACKED TOGETHER SO EVERYTHING IS IN BALANCE

DEGENERACY PRESSURE SCALES WITH THE ELECTRON DENSITY TO THE POWER OF WHILE GRAVITATIONAL FORCES SCALE WITH DENSITY SQUARED AS IT IS THE MULTIPLICATION OF TWO DENSITIES THAT IS NEARLY THE SAME SO INCREASING THE DENSITY BY A CONSTANT FACTOR EVERYWHERE NEARLY LEADS TO A SOLUTION AS WELL

IT IS NOT EXACT FOR HEAVIER BROWN DWARFS THE CORE DENSITY SHOULD INCREASE FASTER THAN LINEAR WITH THE OVERALL MASSACHUSETTS THE OUTER LAYERS ON THE OTHER HAND ARE SUPPORTED BY THE REGULAR REPULSION BETWEEN ATOMS THE DENSITY DOES NOT DEPEND SO MUCH ON PRESSURE WHICH MEANS IT INCREASES SLOWER THAN LINEAR WITH THE OVERALL MASSACHUSETTS THOSE TWO EFFECTS HAPPEN TO CANCEL EACH OTHER ROUGHLY

I WAS PRETTY GOOD AT MATH AND PHYSICS IN HS BUT I WENT INTO COLLEGE WITH THE INTENTION OF DOING A TRACK IN MY SECOND SEMESTER I TOOK DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS II WHICH INCLUDED POWER SERIES SOLUTIONS I THOUGHT THEY WERE FUN TO PLAY WITH AND WE HAD SEEN THE HYDROGEN ATOM PROBLEM IN OUR INTRO TO MODERN PHYSICS CLASS SO I THOUGHT I'D TRY TO SOLVE IT ON MY OWN

I DISCOVERED OF COURSE THAT THE FIRST SERIES FOR THE RADIAL PART I THINK HAS COEFFICIENTS THAT LOOK LIKE CONSTANT I I IN THE NUMERATOR WHERE I IS THE INDEX OF THE COEFFICIENT IF YOU APPLY THOSE BORING CONVERGENCE TESTS YOU LEARN IN CALC II YOU FIND THAT THAT SERIES DIVERGES UNLESS OF COURSE THE SERIES TERMINATES THAT WILL HAPPEN IF AND ONLY CONSTANT N N WHERE N IS SOME INTEGER

KEEP GOING AND YOU FIND TWO MORE SUCH INTEGERS ONLY AFTER I WAS FINISHED DID I REALIZE THAT THOSE CONSTANTS ARE EXACTLY THE QUANTUM NUMBERS FROM HIGH SCHOOL CHEM WHICH LABEL THE STATES OF THE ELECTRONS I WAS ABSOLUTELY GIDDY I FELT LIKE I UNDERSTOOD SOMETHING THAT NOT EVEN MY OLD TEACHERS KNEW I KNEW WHERE THOSE CONSTANTS CAME FROM WHY THEY HAD TO BE INTEGERS WHY L HAD TO BE STRICTLY LESS THAN N ETC

THAT INTERPLAY BETWEEN WHAT SEEMED LIKE PURE MECHANICAL MATHEMATICS AND THE PHYSICS OF ENERGY AND ANGULAR MOMENTUM FLIPPED A SWITCH IN MY BRAIN AND I BECAME VORACIOUS IN MY CONSUMPTION OF PHYSICS
I WAS DRAWN TO IT FOR A SIMILAR REASON I TOOK AP PHYSICS MY SENIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL AND AS THE YEAR WENT ON I BEGAN TO NOTICE THAT NEARLY ALL OF THE CONCEPTS MIRRORED THE STUFF I HAD ALREADY LEARNED IN CALC THE YEAR BEFORE CALCULUS WAS BY FAR MY FAVORITE CLASS IN HIGH SCHOOL AS WELL AS THE CLASS THAT I DID THE BEST IN AND I JUST REALLY ENJOYED BEING ABLE TO APPLY IT IN PHYSICS ANOTHER BIG FACTOR IN MY FASCINATION WITH PHYSICS WAS THE REALIZATION THAT NEARLY EVERY NATURAL PHENOMENON ON EARTH CAN BE QUANTIZED I HAVE ALWAYS HAD THIS FEELING THAT THE STRUCTURE OF THE UNIVERSE AT IT'S CORE IS PURELY MATHEMATICAL AND PHYSICS REALLY ALLOWED ME TO SEE THAT IN A DIFFERENT WAY
FIRST FEW WEEKS OF HIGH SCHOOL PHYSICS DEALT WITH CHECKING UNITS IN EQUATION MY TEACHER RANDOMLY EXPLAINED ONE EQUATION ANGULAR VELOCITY DEFINITION I BELIEVE SOMETHING OF THAT SORT AND I BLURTED OUT THAT'S SO COOL

I HAVE ENCOUNTERED THE DESCRIPTION OF REVERSIBLE IRREVERSIBLE ADIABATIC COMPRESSION EXPANSION WERE Q AND THE PROCESS GOES THROUGH STATES OF IF I HAVE UNDERSTOOD CORRECTLY FOR AN ADIABATIC PROCESS TO BE REVERSIBLE THE PRESSURE OF THE SURROUNDINGS MUST BE EQUAL TO THE PRESSURE OF THE SYSTEM BECAUSE OTHERWISE PART OF THE WORK WILL BE CONVERTED TO HEAT SO IT WILL BE UNOBTAINABLE AS WORK AGAIN

TWO THINGS I'M NOT SURE ABOUT

SAY WE ARE CONSIDERING AN ADIABATIC COMPRESSION PROCESS Q SO U W THE WORK DONE ON THE SYSTEM BUT THEN HOW DO WE LOSE WORK AS HEAT IN AN IRREVERSIBLE PROCESS IF Q IS IT THAT Q REFERS ONLY TO HEAT THAT HAS PASSED THROUGH THE SYSTEM'S BOUNDARIES IN WHICH CASE THAT IS ACTUALLY AND ALL THE WORK IRREVERSIBLY LOST IS GAINED AS HEAT BY THE SYSTEM AS A PART OF THE WORK DONE ON IT FOR INSTANCE VISCOUS FORCES FRICTION FOR AN ABRUPT IRREVERSIBLE CHANGE SO WOULD IT BE RIGHT THAT WE COULD STATE THE FIRST LAW AS U W

2 IN THE REVERSE CASE OF REVERSIBLE IRREVERSIBLE EXPANSION DOES THE SAME IDEA APPLY TO THE SYSTEM OR IS IT THE SURROUNDINGS THAT GAIN HEAT FROM LOST WORK OR DO BOTH THE SURROUNDINGS AND THE SYSTEM LOSE ENERGY IN THE FORM OF HEAT FOR BOTH IRREVERSIBLE CASES COMPRESSION AND EXPANSION

ANYWAY AFTER THESE LITTLE THINGS MY MAIN PROBLEM IS I HAVE NEVER SEEN A TREATMENT IN TEXTS OF PURE HEAT TRANSFER ENDERGONIC THE WAY THEY TREAT THE ADIABATIC CASE BUT THEN WHEN THEY STATE THE SECOND LAW THEY MAKE IT A POINT TO TALK ABOUT HEAT TRANSFERRED FOR THE REVERSIBLE PROCESS NOW I KNOW THAT THE SCOPE OF THE SECOND LAW IS MORE FAR-REACHING THAN PURE HEAT TRANSFER SO IT MAY SEEM A TRIVIAL CASE TO TALK ABOUT PURE HEAT TRANSFER WITHOUT ANY WORK BEING DONE BUT SINCE THERE IS NO MENTION OF IT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING CASES IS TRUE

IS HEAT TRANSFER IN ITSELF ALWAYS REVERSIBLE AND THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES A PROCESS REVERSIBLE OR NOT IS WHETHER THE WORK IS DONE REVERSIBLY OR NOT AND IF SO HOW AND WHY IS IT ALWAYS REVERSIBLE COULD IT BE THAT EVEN A FINITE TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SYSTEM AND SURROUNDING DOESN'T MATTER FOR PURE HEAT TRANSFER

2 IS HEAT TRANSFER IN ITSELF ALWAYS IN WHICH CASE IT SHOULD BE TREATED EXPLICITLY IN TEXTS TO GIVE A CLEAR PICTURE AND AVOID CONFUSION AND IF SO HOW AND WHY IS IT ALWAYS IRREVERSIBLE

IS PURE HEAT TRANSFER IN AND OF ITSELF EITHER REVERSIBLE OR IRREVERSIBLE DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE IF THE TEMPERATURE GRADIENT IS INFINITESIMAL SMALL OR FINITE AND IF THE SYSTEM MOVES THROUGH STATES OF AND IF SO WHAT DOES IT DEPEND ON WHY AND HOW IN WHICH CASE AGAIN IT SHOULD BE TREATED EXPLICITLY IN TEXTS TO GIVE A CLEAR PICTURE AND AVOID CONFUSION

I HAVE FOUND REASONS TO SUPPORT AND REJECT ALL THREE OF THESE CASES SO I CONCLUDED THAT I MUST ASK SOMEONE TO GIVE ME SOME INSIGHT I STRESS THAT I AM TALKING ABOUT PURE HEAT TRANSFER WITH NO WORK BEING PERFORMED FOR INSTANCE TWO OTHERWISE ISOLATED SYSTEMS BROUGHT INTO THERMAL CONTACT THROUGH A SINGLE CONDUCTING WALL

THANKS FOR ANY HELP SORRY FOR THE LONG POST

CHEERS
IS THE SIGNAL DETECTED BY FIGO JUST RAPIDLY MODULATING GRAVITY OR DID IT ALSO DETECT SOME KIND OF WAVE PROPERTIES OF GRAVITY
I REJECTED UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF LONDON TO GO TO LANCASTER UNIVERSITY DID I FUCK IT UP
EDIT I REALLY THINK THAT I FUCKED MYSELF AND LOST A GREAT OPPORTUNITY
I MAJORED IN COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS AND WE REFERENCED WORK EXAMPLES FROM RANGING FROM LOWER LEVEL PHYSICS COURSES AND INTO THE HIGHER LEVEL COURSES SUCH AS QUANTUM MECHANICS BE SURE TO THUMB THROUGH AN INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER SIMULATION METHODS BY HARVEY GOULD JAN TOBOCHNIK AND WOLFGANG CHRISTIAN YOU MAY ALSO WISH TO CHECK OUT SOME OF RUBIN WORK

OPEN SOURCE PHYSICS HAS A MYRIAD OF DJS EXAMPLES RANGING FROM THE TRIVIAL TO VERY COMPLEX AND WITH DJS YOU CAN JUMP INTO MODELING USING MINIMUM RESOURCES MINIMUM CODE AND YOU CAN SCROLL THROUGH A SIGNIFICANT LIST OF EXAMPLES ON THE OSP AND COMPADRE SITES
AND PROGRAMMING AT THE SAME TIME

AS A COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICIST MYSELF I WOULD COMMENT THAT IF YOUR GOAL IS TO LEARN TO PROGRAM IN THE SENSE THAT YOU WANT TO HAVE SKILLS TO MAYBE DO SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT SOME DAY THE PYTHON BOOK WITH COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS IN THE TITLE WON'T GET YOU VERY FAR BEYOND THE ABSOLUTE BASICS IF THAT'S NOT YOUR GOAL THAN THE RECOMMENDATIONS HERE ARE ALL FINE BUT IF IT IS THEN JUST KEEP THAT IN MIND NO COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS BOOK I'VE SEEN IS GOING TO TEACH YOU OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING ALGORITHM DESIGN BEST CODING PRACTICES ETC
I'M SOPHOMORE PHYSICS MAJOR WORKING IN A ENGINEERING LAB AND WITH A PROFESSOR ON THE CMS EXPERIMENT I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE USE PYTHON AND C C A LOOKOUT ESPECIALLY C WE ALSO USE GNUPLOT FOR GRAPHS MATHEMATIC AND MATALAN WORK EQUALLY WELL I ALSO USE ROOT BUT THAT'S LIKE C AND PYTHON CERN PEOPLE USE THAT MOSTLY I LEARNED C AND PYTHON USING ONLINE FREE RESOURCES I WILL LEAVE THE LINKS HERE WHEN I FIND THEM

IF YOU HAVE OTHER QUESTIONS FEEL FREE TO MESSAGE ME
A GREAT BOOK TO CONSIDER IS COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS BY MARK NEWMAN IT GIVES GREAT EXAMPLES AND HAS SOME COOL PROBLEMS TO SOLVE THE BOOK TEACHES COMPUTATIONAL METHODS USING PYTHON EXCLUSIVELY
PYTHON RESOURCE PAGE FOR USE IN SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING

PYTHON LIBRARIES FOR PHYSICISTS
I FOUND IT CAN BE REALLY CHALLENGING TO LEARN BOTH PROGRAMMING AND COMPLEX PROBLEM SOLVING WITH IT AT THE SAME TIME BUT WORTH A SHOT ANYWAY

I'D RECOMMEND A GOOD BOOK ON LEARNING PYTHON THE SIDEBAR ON R LEARNPROGRAMMING MAY BE A GOOD RESOURCE WORKING THROUGH SOME OF A BOOK WOULD BE A GOOD START BEFORE JUMPING INTO COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS ONCE THAT IS DONE I THINK THERE IS A NUMERICAL RECIPES BOOK IN PYTHON THAT WOULD COME IN HANDY BASICALLY IT'S A BOOK FULL OF USEFUL ALGORITHMS TO SOLVE A VARIETY OF PROBLEMS THEN WORKING THROUGH SOME SIMPLE MECHANICS PROBLEMS WOULD BE A GOOD START ALSO HAS SOME MATH TO SOLVE

TYPED ALL THIS ON MOBILE SO I COULDN'T PROVIDE AS MANY LINKS AS I'D LIKE BUT HOPEFULLY IT'S SOMETHING TO USE AS A STARTING OFF POINT


YOU ARE READING WAY TOO MUCH INTO THAT STATEMENT SEAN CARROLL IS AS ATHEIST AS THEY COME AND AT MOST HE COULD BE ACCUSED OF USING FLOWERY LANGUAGE TO APPEAL TO A WIDE YOUTUBE AUDIENCE IT'S LIKE SAYING OBJECTS LIKE TO BE AT A STATE OF LOWER POTENTIAL ENERGY I'M NOT IMPLYING A ROCK HAS SECRET DESIRES IT'S JUST EASIER LANGUAGE TO EXPLAIN WHY THE ROCK ROLLS DOWN THE HILL

2 BILLIONS OF YEARS VS A FEW DECADES THERE HAS BEEN WORK ON OTHER SELF REPLICATING SYSTEMS BUT I THINK MANY SCIENTISTS ARE NOT TRYING TO REINVENT THE WHEEL NOT REALLY MY AREA OF EXPERTISE

ACTIVATION ENERGY SO IT'LL STAY THERE UNLESS ENOUGH ENERGY HAS BEEN SUPPLIED TO GET IT OUT BUT IN THE LONG TERM THE SUN WILL CONSUME THE EARTH PROTONS MIGHT DECAY AND IF THEY DON'T EVERY ELEMENT MIGHT QUANTUM TUNNEL TO FUSE INTO IRONICALLY THAT OIL WON'T STAY DOWN THERE FOR AN INFINITE TIME EVENTUALLY IT WILL GO TO A LOWER ENERGY STATE
IT'S NOT THAT THERE IS A PERSONALITY DRIVING THE PROCESS OR ANYTHING THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS ISN'T NECESSARILY DRIVEN BY RANDOMNESS EITHER THOUGH IT'S A STATISTICAL LAW THE PROBABILITY THAT ENTROPY WILL GO UP IN ANY SYSTEM IS HUGE FROM MY UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT SEAN SAID CARBON DIOXIDE HAS A LOT OF FREE ENERGY WITH NO DIRECT CHEMICAL REACTION TO USE THAT ENERGY AND LIFE SOLVES THAT PROBLEM TAKING THE LOW ENTROPY ENERGY AND CONVERTING IT TO A HIGHER ENTROPY ENERGY FURTHERING ALONG THE 2ND LAW


ISSUE 2 THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WORKING ON ABIOGENESIS IT'S KIND OF A TWO PART PROBLEM AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW BOTH THINGS HAPPENED AND HOW HOW SELF REPLICATION HAPPENED AND HOW METABOLISM HAPPENED WHICH CAME FIRST AND HOW DID THE OTHER COME ABOUT SEAN IS SUGGESTING THAT THE ENERGY PROCESSING PART OF LIFE IS THE MORE IMPORTANT PART IF THAT IS THE TENDENCY FOR ENERGY TO GO THEN THESE PROCESSES CAN HAPPEN AGAIN AND AGAIN AND EVENTUALLY THROUGH A DARWINIAN PROCESS SOME KIND OF REPLICATION STICKS WITH IT I THINK


ISSUE SURE THAT OIL MIGHT STAY THERE WITH ALL ITS POTENTIAL ENERGY FOR A VERY LONG TIME BUT EVENTUALLY IT'S ENERGY WILL BE USED IT MIGHT NOT GET USED UNTIL THE SUN DEVOURS THE EARTH BUT IT WILLIAM THE UNIVERSE IS ON A ONE WAY TRIP TO THE HIGHEST ENTROPY CONFIGURATION THAT IT COULD BE IN SUN EATS EARTH STARS ALL BURN THROUGH THEIR FUEL MORE BLACK HOLES FORM EVERYTHING FALLS IN BLACK HOLES BLACK HOLES EVAPORATE DUE TO HAWKING RADIATION UNIVERSE IS LEFT IN HIGHEST ENTROPY STATE IT COULD BE IN SPARSE SINGLE PARTICLES IN A COLD DARK SPACE TIME LOSES ITS MEANING IN THIS HIGHEST ENTROPY CONFIGURATION
YOU SOUND INTERESTED IN ABIOGENESIS

IF CORRECT THEN YOU MAY FIND USEFUL INFORMATION ON THAT PAGE
ISSUE THE REACTIONS DON'T TRY TO FIND A WAY TO SUSTAIN ITSELF JUST ASSUME THAT THERE ARE MANY RANDOM REACTIONS NOW SOME OF HAPPEN TO REPLICATE THEMSELVES OR ELSE THE INITIAL REAGENTS TAKE SOME BASIC COMPONENTS AVAILABLE IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND BUILD A COPY OF THE REAGENTS NOW YOU HAVE TWICE AS MANY SELF REPLICATING REACTIONS AND SOON THEY WILL BE THE MOST NUMEROUS

ISSUE 2 U FOOLISHCHEMIST ALREADY POINTED OUT THE TIME PROBLEM THE OTHER ONE IS THE RECIPE NO ONE KNOWS WHAT THE MINIMAL SELF SUSTAINING REACTION IS

ISSUE HAS BEEN ADDRESSED WELL ENOUGH BY SOME SUCH AS U FOOLISHCHEMIST AND U REVERENDPARIAH
IS THERE ANY SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR DETERMINING HOW DISORDERED A SYSTEM IS FOR EXAMPLE IT DOESN'T SEEM INTUITIVE TO ME THAT THE UNIVERSE AS IT IS NOW MOSTLY VACUUM AREAS OF LOW DENSITY GAS AND DUST AND AREAS OF HIGH DENSITY LIKE STARS AND PLANETS IS LESS DISORDERED THAN A UNIVERSE ONLY FILLED WITH PHOTONS SLOWLY COOLING TO ABSOLUTE ZERO
YOU'D PROBABLY BE INTERESTED IN THIS PAPER

NATURE JOURNAL FULL


DOES THIS ANSWER YOUR SECOND ISSUE AUTOCATALYTIC BISTABLE OSCILLATORY NETWORKS CAN BE PREPARED IN THE LAB USING CHEMICALS PRESUMABLY SIMILAR TO THE EARTH

ALSO TRY NOT TO THINK THAT LIFE IS MOVING TOWARDS A SPECIFIC PURPOSE IF ANYTHING ORGANISMS ARE SIMPLY TRYING TO MOVE AWAY FROM STRESS IN ANY WAY THEY CAN FOR EXAMPLE INTRONS DIDN'T EVOLVE BECAUSE ORGANISMS WANTED TO MAKE THEIR GENETIC CODE MORE COMPLEX IT WAS AN ADAPTATION TO RAMPANT RETROTRANSPOSON ACTIVITY

NATURE JOURNAL FULL


ANTIBIOTICS RESTRICTION ENZYMES THE SYSTEM DNA METHYLATION SPLICING THE HISTONE CODE AND HETEROCHROMATIN ALL EMERGED SIMPLY BECAUSE ORGANISMS NEEDED A WAY TO DEAL WITH SELECTIVE PRESSURES AT THAT TIME
AS OTHERS ALREADY MENTIONED WE ARE NOT THERE YET

BUT IF WE REALLY CAN GET A SINGLE THEORY OF EVERYTHING I EAST UNIFICATION OF THE STANDARD MODEL GRAVITY DM DE IT SHOULD BE A SINGLE EQUATION LIKE WE CURRENTLY HAVE FOR THE STANDARD MODEL WHICH IS A COMPOSITE LAGRANGIAN OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE THEORY EAST G QED CD

ALSO NOTE THAT EQUATIONS CAN'T DESCRIBE ALL OF EM IT GOT REPLACED BY QED LIKE THEORY OF GRAVITY WAS REPLACED BY THEORY OF GENERAL RELATIVITY

WHILE EQUATIONS ALONG WITH THE REST OF CLASSICAL ELECTROMAGNETISM ARE EXTRAORDINARILY SUCCESSFUL AT EXPLAINING AND PREDICTING A VARIETY OF PHENOMENA THEY ARE NOT EXACT BUT APPROXIMATIONS IN SOME SPECIAL SITUATIONS THEY CAN BE NOTICEABLY INACCURATE EXAMPLES INCLUDE EXTREMELY STRONG FIELDS SEE EULER HEISENBERG LAGRANGIAN AND EXTREMELY SHORT DISTANCES SEE VACUUM POLARIZATION

MOREOVER VARIOUS PHENOMENA OCCUR IN THE WORLD EVEN THOUGH EQUATIONS PREDICT THEM TO BE IMPOSSIBLE SUCH AS NONCLASSICAL LIGHT AND QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT OF ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS SEE QUANTUM OPTICS FINALLY ANY PHENOMENON INVOLVING INDIVIDUAL PHOTONS SUCH AS THE PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT LAW THE DUANE HUNT LAW LIGHT DETECTORS ETC WOULD BE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN IF EQUATIONS WERE EXACTLY TRUE AS EQUATIONS DO NOT INVOLVE PHOTONS

FOR THE MOST ACCURATE PREDICTIONS IN ALL SITUATIONS EQUATIONS HAVE BEEN SUPERSEDED BY QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS

FROM WIKIPEDIA LIMITATIONS OF THE MAXWELL EQUATIONS AS A THEORY OF ELECTROMAGNETISM
DS WHERE S IS THE ACTION
WE'RE WORKING ON IT
THAT ISN'T SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE
FOLLOWUP QUESTION WHICH IS PERHAPS CLOSER TO WHAT OP HAD IN MIND HOW MANY EQUATIONS FULLY DESCRIBE GR AND QM
IN PRINCIPLE THE LAGRANGIAN FOR THE STANDARD MODEL AND THE EINSTEIN FIELD EQUATIONS FOR GR SHOULD DESCRIBE ALL PHYSICS BUT DESCRIBING A MACROSCOPIC SYSTEM IN TERMS OF FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUENTS IN IN PRINCIPLE POSSIBLE IS USUALLY A NOT HELPFUL AND B NOT REALLY POSSIBLE SO IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN EQUATIONS THAT NOT ONLY DESCRIBE PHYSICS IN PRINCIPLE BUT ACTUALLY GIVE YOU MEANINGFUL RESULTS YOU'RE PROBABLY LOOKING AT A MUCH LARGER NUMBER OF EQUATIONS I SEVERELY DOUBT THAT ANY ONE PHYSICIST KNOWS ALL OF THEM GIVEN HOW SPECIALIZED SOME FIELDS ARE
CURRENTLY TWO EQUATIONS DESCRIBE ALL OF KNOWN PHYSICS

THE STANDARD MODEL LAGRANGIAN

FIELD EQUATIONS

WE ARE CURRENTLY LOOKING FOR A METHOD TO UNIFY THESE INTO A SINGLE EQUATION WHILST EXPLAINING CURRENTLY UNEXPLAINED PHENOMENON
DEFINE PHYSICS
YEAH SOMEONE POSTED THE FIN DU MOND ARTICLE HERE A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO NOPE TURNS OUT THE AUTHORS OF THAT PAPER WERE TOO HASTY THEIR SIMULATIONS ARE NOT EVEN REMOTELY ENOUGH TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY ACCELERATION RELATION MUCH LESS KILL MOND CURRENTLY THE ISSUE REMAINS AT DARFUR IS GOING ON LEVEL

I THINK THERE'S A GENUINE CHANCE DARK MATTER DOESN'T REALLY EXIST AND GRAVITY BECOMES MODIFIED AT VERY LOW ACCELERATIONS DUE TO QUANTUM GRAVITY EFFECTS STILL VERY FAR FROM CERTAINTY THOUGH
HEY THERE

IT IS HARD TO SUGGEST SAFETY SCHOOLS WHEN WE DO NOT KNOW HOW YOU DID IN UNDERGRAD I CAN SEE YOU WENT TO UIUC FROM YOUR POST HISTORY BUT A CURSORY LOOK DOESN'T REVEAL ANYMORE THAN THAT

THE BIGGEST MISTAKE YOU CAN MAKE IS UNDERESTIMATING JUST HOW COMPETITIVE HET IS ESPECIALLY AT THE LISTED SCHOOLS ALL OF THOSE SCHOOLS ARE VERY SOLIDLY IN THE REACH CATEGORY BARRING SOME COMBINATION OF AGRE TOP FEW OF YOUR CLASS RELEVANT RESEARCH EXPERIENCE ETC

GIVEN THE SHEER VOLUME OF APPLICATIONS THESE SCHOOLS RECEIVE MUCH OF THEIR ANALYSIS IS BASED OFF THE QUANTITATIVE ASPECTS OF YOUR APPLICATION AND ANY WEAKNESSES IN THESE ASPECTS ARE DISQUALIFYING
WHICH AREA OF HET ARE YOU LOOKING AT IT STRIKES ME AS ODD TO HAVE STRING THEORY AS A BACKUP OPTION SINCE THOSE GROUPS TEND TO BE MORE SELECTIVE AND SMALLER THAN PHANO GROUPS

MOST US HAVE A GOOD PROGRAM BUT WITH DIFFERENT FOCUS FOR INSTANCE UCLA DOES A LOT OF SCATTERING AMPLITUDES WHILE UCSC HAS CLOSE TIES TO SAC AND HAS A LOT OF BREADTH CORNELL IS NOT EASY TO GET INTO NOT SURE ABOUT ADMISSION PROSPECTS AT STONY BROOK BUT THEY'RE DOING GREAT WORK IN DARK MATTER DETECTION AND HAVE SOME REAL HEAVY HITTERS IN COLLIDER AND HIGGS PHYSICS PITTSBURGH IS GOOD WITH COLLIDER STUFF AND MORE ASTROPARTICLEY THINGS WASHINGTON HAS A STRONG LATTICE GROUP AND THEY'VE GOT SOME BIG NAMES IN MODEL BUILDING SO YEAH IF ANY OF THOSE THINGS APPEAL TO YOU APPLY TO THOSE SCHOOLS

LOOK AT A BUNCH OF SCHOOLS FOR GROUPS AND PROFESSORS THAT YOU'D LIKE TO WORK WITH LOOK AT THEIR PREPRINTS AND SEE IF YOU'D LIKE TO WORK ON THE SAME TYPE OF STUFF HONESTLY IF YOU DO THAT YOU'LL BE WAY AHEAD OF THE CURVE ASK YOUR LETTER WRITERS FOR ADVICE ON WHERE TO APPLY
I HAVEN'T LOOK AT THE PHYSICS RANKINGS IN A WHILE BUT WHAT ABOUT CU I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE WITH YOUR RESEARCH INTERESTS BUT IT IS RESPECTED AND HAS GOOD FACULTY
THIS IS THE DUDE WHO WORKED OUT THE PHYSICAL CONSEQUENCES OF AN SO LORENTZ GROUP FOR A BOOK RIGHT MY ROOMMATE KEEPS ON RECOMMENDING HIM MAYBE I'LL GIVE HIM A SHOT
HIS PERMUTATION CITY IS ALSO REALLY GOOD
I'D ALSO HIGHLY RECOMMEND DRAGON'S EGG BY ROBERT LINE FORWARD AMERICAN PHYSICIST AND SCIENCE FICTION WRITER HIS FICTION IS NOTED FOR ITS SCIENTIFIC CREDIBILITY AND USES MANY IDEAS DEVELOPED DURING HIS WORK AS AN AEROSPACE ENGINEER
AS A IT WAS A TOUGH BUT REWARDING READ
I'D ALSO TENTATIVELY RECOMMEND ALASTAIR REYNOLDS REVELATION SPACE SERIES I FOUND HIS SCIENCE TO BE BELIEVABLE

EDIT SPELLING
IT WAS A MEMORABLE READ FOR ME ONE OF THE BOOKS THAT REPRESENTS FOR ME THE VALUE OF SCIENCE FICTION I SEE IT AS A SPIRITUAL DESCENDANT OF FLATLAND BY A KING DEWDNEY
ALL OF GREG BOOKS ARE THE BEST OF VERY HARD SCI-FI LADDER ALSO CONTAINS AMAZING PHYSICS AS WELL AS THE ARROW OF TIME TRILOGY AND QUARANTINE YOU NEED AT LEAST A BS IN PHYSICS TO GET THROUGH SOME OF HIS BOOKS IF NOT A PH D
MY ASTROPHYSICS PROF ONCE KNEW A GUY WHO WAS WRITING A SCI FI NOVEL ABOUT LIFE ON A NEUTRON STAR SUPPOSEDLY ONE DAY HE ASKED HOW THE NOVEL WAS GOING WELL I FIGURED OUT ALL THE PHYSICS SO THAT'S A START HE SAID

MY PROFESSOR THEN ASKED ABOUT THE PLOT OH I'LL FIGURE THAT ONE OUT LATER

THE BOOK TURNED OUT TO BE THE DRAGON'S EGG AND JUDGING BY THE WIKI FOR THE BOOK IT WAS PRETTY SUCCESSFUL SO KUDOS TO HIM
RED GREEN BLUE MARS
ALL GREG EGAN BOOKS ARE PRETTY INTERESTING I FOUND HIS INTERPRETATION OF THE THERMODYNAMIC ARROW OF TIME RATHER IFFY IN HIS OTHER BOOK BUT REGARDLESS MOST SCIENCE FICTION NOVELS DON'T EVEN APPROACH HIS LEVEL OF SCIENTIFIC ACCURACY
I'D ALSO RECOMMEND SOLARIS BY STANISLAW LEM IF YOU DON'T LIKE TECHNOBABBLE SCI-FI FILLED WITH TROPES AND PREFER A GOOD STORY
EGAN WRITES HARD SCIFI I EAST SCIFI THAT TRIES TO PLAY COOL WITH THE KNOWN RULES OF SCIENCE HE MAY INVENT A HYPOTHESIS OR TWO BUT THEN HIS WORLD REMAINS CONSISTENT WITH THAT ASSUMPTION AND WITH THE RULES OF LOGIC

ANOTHER GOOD EXAMPLE FROM HIS WRITINGS IS THE ORTHOGONAL SERIES A CLOCKWORK ROCKET AND THE REST THE SCIENCE PART OF THIS SERIES IS ACTUALLY PRETTY INTRICATE I HAD TO SLOW DOWN INITIALLY TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WAS DIGESTED PROPERLY BUT THEN IT WAS VERY INTERESTING TO FOLLOW THE STORY WHICH AGAIN FOLLOWED WHATEVER CONCLUSIONS CAME OUT OF THE INITIAL ASSUMPTIONS NO MATTER HOW WEIRD

SELF-CONSISTENCY IS IMPORTANT FOR HARD SCIFI AND EGAN DOES IT WELL HE'S PERHAPS NOT THE MOST BRILLIANT NOVELIST OUT THERE BUT HE HAS EXCELLENT CONTROL OVER THE NARRATIVE AS IT EMERGES LOGICALLY FROM THE RULES OF THE GAME IF YOU HAVE A TASTE FOR INTELLECTUAL STIMULATION WITH A FLAVOR OF SCIENCE AND LOGIC HIS BOOKS ARE A GOOD CHOICE
WHILE WE'RE DOING RECOMMENDATIONS I'D LIKE TO ADD THE RED MARS SERIES BY KIM STANLEY ROBINSON I'M ONLY HALFWAY THROUGH BUT SO FAR THERE IS A LOT OF BELIEVABLE SCIENCE IN IT AND A LOT OF DETAIL ABOUT HOW EXACTLY THE CHARACTERS GET THINGS DONE WHILE COLONIZING MARS
ANOTHER THING I'D RECOMMEND THAT'S A BIT OUT THERE BUT SHOULD DEFINITELY BE READ BY EVERYONE DRAGONS EGG
JUST ORDERED THE BEST DEAL BY FAR WAS FOR A USED PAPERBACK ON NOT SURE WHY IT'S SO EXPENSIVE ON AMAZON

THANKS FOR THE RECOMMENDATION LOVE ME SOME HARD SCI FI
WHILE WE ARE ON THE SUBJECT A LOT OF THE PHYSICS IN THE MASS EFFECTS GAMES IS WELL DONE AND BELIEVABLE ESPECIALLY IF YOU READ THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEMS AND PLANETS FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS A PLANET IN THE GAME THAT IS TIDALLY LOCKED TO ITS STAR CREATING A PERMANENT HOT SIDE COLD SIDE AND A PERMANENT STORM BETWEEN THE TWO A CERTAIN CHARACTER LIVES IN AN AIRCRAFT THAT CONSTANTLY FLIES INSIDE THE STORM IN ORDER TO HIDE WHICH SYPHON A ELECTRICITY FROM THE LIGHTNING AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE THERE ARE SOME SPECIES WHO CAN'T POSSIBLE SHARE DISEASES BECAUSE THEIR BIOMOLECULES HAVE THE OPPOSITE CHIRALITY
QUARANTINE AND HIS SHORT STORY COLLECTIONS ARE ALSO FANTASTIC THERE'S ONLY A COUPLE OF BOOKS HE'S WRITTEN THAT I DIDN'T ENJOY
SOUNDS LIKE THIS AUTHOR HAS SOME INTERESTING READS THANKS FOR THE TIP
I KNEW A GUY DOING HIS MASTER'S IN PHYSICS NAMED GREG EGAN I WONDER IF PEOPLE GET HIM CONFUSED WITH THE AUTHOR
THREE DOLLARS FOR THE KINDLE EDITION SOLD
MY RECOMMENDATIONS ARE THE HYPERION CANTOS AND ANYTHING BY JULIO VERNE
AS FICTION I JUST COULDN'T GET INTO BOOKS I WANTED TO LIKE HIS BOOKS BUT JUST DIDN'T FIND THE WRITING PARTICULARLY COMPELLING OR THE CHARACTERS INTERESTING
YOU SHOULD CHECK OUT THE THREE BODY PROBLEM AND IT'S SEQUELS THEY ARE GREAT BOOKS WITH GREAT STORY AND BELIEVABLE PHYSICS ESPECIALLY IN THE FIRST TWO BOOKS I DEVOURED EACH BOOK WITHIN A WEEK OF THEM BEING RELEASED THEY'RE GREAT
DOWNVOTE ME I'M A BOOKMARK
MUONS PRIMARILY DECAY INTO ELECTRONS AND NEUTRINOS PRODUCE NEUTRINOS AND POSITRONS YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITH THE NEUTRINOS THEY'LL ZIP RIGHT THROUGH THE EARTH WITHOUT INTERACTING WITH ANYTHING BUT IN PRINCIPLE YOU COULD TRY TO COLLECT THE ENERGY OF THE ELECTRONS THE EASIEST WAY WOULD SIMPLY TO HARVEST THE HEAT GENERATED BY THESE ELECTRONS AS THEY IMPACT MATTER AND SLOW DOWN FOR EXAMPLE PLACING A BASIN OF WATER NEXT TO A SUFFICIENTLY BRILLIANT SOURCE OF NEUTRONS WOULD CAUSE THE BASIN TO BOIL WHICH CAN BE USED TO DRIVE A STEAM TURBINE AN ALTERNATIVE OPTION WOULD BE TO USE FUSION WHICH RELIES ON THE FACT THAT IF A HYDROGEN MOLECULE REACTS WITH A MUON THE MUON PULLS THE HYDROGEN ATOMS SO CLOSE THAT THEY UNDERGO FUSION AND THEN USE THE HEAT OF THAT FUSION REACTOR TO DRIVE A STEAM TURBINE

THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS GETTING THE MUONS THEY DO COME FROM OUTER SPACE BUT THEIR DENSITY IS VERY LOW PRODUCING ENERGY FROM THEM WOULD BE LIKE TRYING TO PRODUCE ENERGY FROM BIRD CHIRPS WE CAN ALSO PRODUCE THEM OURSELVES BUT THEN WE'D NEED TO PUT IN MORE ENERGY THAN WE'D GET OUT WHICH DEFEATS THE ENTIRE POINT
IT DEPENDS ON THE ENVIRONMENT A COMMON SITUATION IS IN A FINE GRAINED PARTICLE DETECTOR CMS OR ATLAS FOR EXAMPLE NOTE THAT THE M IN CMS STANDS FOR MUON IN THAT CASE MUONS LOSE ENERGY AT A PRETTY HIGH RATE GIVEN BY DE DX IF THE DETECTOR IS LARGE ENOUGH ALL OF THE ENERGY OF THE MUON WILL BE DEPOSITED AND ITS ENERGY CAN BE DETERMINED CALORIMETRICALLY JUST AS WITH PHOTONS AND ELECTRONS ANOTHER WAY THAT MUONS ARE MEASURED IS WITH SCINTILLATORS OR CHERENKOV WATER TANKS PIERRE AUGER TELESCOPE ARRAY AND DICE-TOP COME TO MIND WHERE AN ATMOSPHERIC MUON DEPOSITS SOME AMOUNT OF ENERGY IN THE SCINTILLATOR TANK THIS DOESN'T PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE MUON ENERGY JUST TIMING AND RATE INFORMATION
THE MUONS HAVE A TOTAL POWER OF THE ORDER OF A FEW MICROWATT PER SQUARE METER OR A FEW WATTS PER SQUARE KILOMETER COMPARE THIS TO THE WATT PER SQUARE METER WE GET FROM THE SUN EVEN IF WE COULD MAGICALLY HARVEST THE WHOLE ENERGY OF ALL MUONS IT WOULD BE UTTERLY NEGLIGIBLE
TRYING TO FIND INITIAL CONDITIONS FOR A SEMICLASSICAL BLACK HOLE MODEL HOPING TO FIND SOME WELL BEHAVED ANALYTIC SOLUTION NEAR THE BLACK HOLE HORIZON WHICH I CAN THEN NUMERICALLY EVOLVE TOWARDS THE SINGULARITY WHERE HOPEFULLY MY MODIFIED EQUATIONS OF MOTION WILL ACTUALLY CAUSE THE SINGULARITY TO BE AVOIDED

DO ANY OF YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE A GOOD SOURCE ON BLACK HOLES
LECTURES STARTED OR WEEKS AGO THIS SEMESTER I GOT PARTICLE AND NUCLEAR PHYSICS SOLID-STATE PHYSICS AND THERMODYNAMICS AND STATISTICAL PHYSICS

SO FAR MY FAVORITE ONE IS PARTICLE AND NUCLEAR PHYSICS IS FAIRLY UNEXCITING AND THERMO AND STAT IS RATHER SIMPLE ATM BUT I HAVE HEARD THAT IT IS ONE OF THE HARDER COURSES OVERALL

THE MAIN WORKLOAD HOWEVER IS GOING TO BE BECAUSE OF SOME PRACTICAL WORK WE HAVE TO DO BASICALLY EVERY FRIDAY UNTIL CHRISTMAS

WE WERE TOLD THAT IT WILL TAKE HOURS OF PREOPERATION HOURS OF WORK IN THE LAB AND HOURS TO ANALYSE THE DATA AND WRITE A REPORT

ATLEAST WE GOT TOPICS WE LIKED ALTHOUGH WE DIDNT GET OUR FAVORITES

WE GOT



LIFETIME OF LYONS

PHOTOEMISSION SPECTROSCOPY

OPTICAL EMISSION AND ABSORPTION SPECTRUMS

NUCLEAR REACTOR

TRANSVERSAL VIBRATING REED MAGNETOMETER

OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY

ACTIVITY DETERMINATION OF RADIOACTIVE SAMPLES

FIRST ONE STARTING THIS WEEK

ALSO HAD TO GET MORE FAMILIAR WITH LATEX

WE ARE DONE WITH THE FIRST ONE NOW DOING THE EXPERIMENT WAS RATHER RELAXED YOU START A MEASUREMENT WAIT A BIT SWITCH SAMPLE AND START OVER THE HARDEST PART WAS GETTING THE DOS PROGRAM TO WORK ATLEAST WE COULD PUT THE DATA ONTO A USB DRIVER DIRECTLY AND DIDNT HAVE TO GO THE ROUTE WHERE YOU PUT IT ON A FLOPPY DISK AND GO TO THE ONLY GUY IN THE BUILDING THAT STILL HAS A FDA

WHAT TOOK IS TAKING THE LONGEST IS ACTUALLY MAKING THE DIAGRAMS AND DOING THE REPORT ITS NOT HARD BUT JUST A LOT AND IT GETS REALLY FRUSTRATING WHEN YOU REALIZE YOU MADE A MISTAKE AND HAVE TO REDO A COUPLE HOURS OF WORK

I'M WORKING ON MATERIAL OUTGASSING IN A VACUUM UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE NOT GOTTEN THE SYSTEM PUMPING DOWN TO A LOW ENOUGH PRESSURE SO WE CANNOT START RECORDING ACTUAL DATA YET
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HYDRODYNAMICS IN CURVED SPACE-TIME AS I'M TRYING TO BEGIN A NEW PROJECT ON MAGNETIC FIELDS IN THE EARLY UNIVERSE

GETTING NOWHERE YET
WORKING ON A SPACE PHYSICS WORKSHEET I SWEAR THE PERSON RUNNING THE COURSE DECIDED TO CRAM ALL OF THE DIFFICULT WORK INTO THE LAST ASSIGNMENT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BECAUSE IT'S LATE OR WHAT BUT I CAN'T FOR THE LIFE OF ME FIGURE OUT HOW TO DERIVE THE E CROSS B DRIFT IT SEEMS LIKE IT SHOULD BE SIMPLE BUT UGH MAKES YOU QUESTION WHETHER YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT FIELD IF YOU CAN'T DO IT
LEARNING SOME THEORY OF DISTRIBUTIONS DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY LINEAR CONNECTION ON MANIFOLD QUANTUM FIELD THEORY AND BEGINNING STUDY OF REPRESENTATION THEORY WHICH IS CORE TOPIC OF MY MASTER THESIS
DOING MANY ANNOYING DERIVATIONS FOR A THERMODYNAMIC MODEL OF THE GAS IN ASIO 2 GOOD REVISION OF UNDERGRAD CALCULUS
SO I MEAN SINCE IT'S QUITE OBVIOUS THAT ALL OF PHYSICS COULDN'T POSSIBLY EXPLAIN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WE MUST JUMP TO THE NEXT LINE OF VALID REASONING GHOSTS
THIS LOOKS LIKE A PRESSURE DROP BETWEEN THE ROOMS CREATING A SMALL VORTEX AT THE DOOR FRAME
SO IT COULD HONESTLY BE ANYTHING
IN ESSENCE YOU DON'T ANYTHING WITH MORE THAN 2 BODIES DOES NOT HAVE ANALYTIC SOLUTIONS YOU CAN CALCULATE THIS IS KNOWN AS THE BODY PROBLEM THE ONLY WAY TO PROCEED IS NUMERICALLY YOU MAKE THE ASSUMPTION FORCES DON'T VARY FOR A SHORT TIME INTEGRATE THE MOTION THEN RECALCULATE THE FORCES THERE IS A LOT OF SOPHISTICATION YOU CAN ADD TO THIS BUT FUNDAMENTALLY THAT IS IT DYNAMICS IS AN ACTIVE AREA OF ASTROPHYSICAL RESEARCH AN THIS IS ALL ANYONE IS REALLY DOING AGAIN WITH VASTLY MORE SOPHISTICATION

IF YOU WANT TO USE A CODE AND LOOK AT THE RESULTS OF SOME SMALL SIMULATIONS THERE ARE OPEN SOURCE CODE YOU CAN USE LIKE GADGET IF YOU'RE ONLY INTERESTED IN IT AS A MATHEMATICAL PROBLEM I'M AFRAID YOU'RE OUT OF LUCK
IF COMPUTING SPEED WASN'T A LIMITATION YOU COULD USE AN EULER METHOD TYPE SCHEME WHERE YOU COMPUTE THE FORCES AT A GIVEN TIME UPDATE THE VELOCITIES AND POSITIONS AND REPEAT THIS ISN'T USED IN PRACTICE BECAUSE THE COMPUTATION TIME SCALES AS N 2 YOU MIGHT GET SOME INSIGHT INTO A MORE PRACTICAL SOLUTION FROM VOLKER GADGET A HYDRODYNAMICS CODE WHICH SCALES AS N LOG NOUN

ABS
OTHERS HAVE SUGGESTED FINDING A SHITTY JOB IF YOU NEED THE INCOME THEN PERHAPS THAT'S FINE BUT I WOULD SUGGEST FINDING A RESEARCH GROUP TO WORK WITH ASK YOUR PROFESSORS FOR ANY IDEAS SOME NATIONAL LABS OFFER YEAR LONG SUMMER OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNDERGRADS RECENT GRADUATES AND THEY PAY
THIS IS WHAT MY PROFESSOR TOLD ME ABOUT TAKING A GAP YEAR GET A SHITTY JOB NOT A REAL JOB LIKE MAKING COFFEE AT STARBUCKS OR SOMETHING SOMETHING THAT YOU'LL HATE DOING THAT WAY YOU'LL BE MORE WILLING TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL BECAUSE HE SAID IF I STOPPED SCHOOL GOT A REAL JOB AND STARTED MAKING MONEY I'D LIKE IT TOO MUCH
I DID THAT IT WAS A GOOD DECISION
I TOOK A GAP YEAR AFTER GRADUATING FROM UNDERGRAD I WORKED FOR A FEW MONTHS AND THEN WENT TRAVELING FOR THE NEXT MONTHS WITH THE MONEY I SAVED IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST DECISIONS I'VE EVER MADE I HAD THE TIME OF MY LIFE AND I ONLY STOPPED TRAVELING BECAUSE I HAD TO START GRAD SCHOOL

I WAS VERY LUCKY THAT I DIDN'T HAVE ANY LOANS TO PAY OFF AND HAD A DECENT AMOUNT SAVED TO TRAVEL FOR THAT LONG IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT I ABSOLUTELY WOULD RECOMMEND IT

IN MY OPINION PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF THINK WAY TOO LINEARLY ABOUT HOW TO GO THROUGH LIFE COLLEGE WORK GRAD SCHOOL WHATEVER TAKING THE TIME OFF TO TRAVEL OPENED MY EYES AND I GAINED A LOT OF PERSPECTIVE ABOUT WHAT I WANTED TO DO IN THE FUTURE

EVEN IF YOU'RE SPENDING THE TIME AT AN ENGINEERING JOB THAT'S STILL A GREAT EXPERIENCE TO HAVE BEFORE DOING GRAD SCHOOL YOU MAY FIND PASSION IN YOUR WORK OR YOU MAY FIND THAT YOU DON'T WANT OR NEED TO GO TO GRAD SCHOOL
I WOULD SAY IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A BAD IDEA PROVIDED YOURE WORKING SOMEWHERE IDEALLY YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE DOING SOMETHING THAT CAN BE ADDED TO YOUR CV
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF GOOD RESPONSES BUT I'LL ADD MY VOTE I WENT DIRECTLY FROM UNDERGRAD INTO AN ENGINEERING PHD AND I WISH I HAD TAKEN MORE TIME TO FIND A RESEARCH GROUP IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU FIND AN ADVISOR AND GROUP WORKING ON SOMETHING THAT EXCITES YOU IF TAKING A YEAR OFF WILL HELP YOU FIND THAT THEN DO IT
I'M TAKING A GAP YEAR TO DO RESEARCH WITH THE GROUP I WANT BE A GRADUATE STUDENT IN IT DOESN'T GET MORE RELEVANT THAN THAT

OTHERWISE TRY TO STAY IN ACADEMIA THROUGH JULI OR SOME OTHER POSITION WITH ANOTHER PROFESSOR'S GROUP YOU CAN WORK HOURS A WEEK IN A LAB AND YOU'LL STILL FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE MORE TIME TO ACTUALLY STUDY FOR THE AGRE IF YOU WANT TO TAKE IT AGAIN AS LONG AS YOU CAN REALLY JUSTIFY THE TIME OFF THEN IT SHOULDN'T HURT YOU
IF YOU THINK YOU NEED TO DO IT ABSOLUTELY DO IT
I DIDN'T TAKE A GAP YEAR AND I JUST STARTED MY MSC

I'M REALLY REGRETTING NOT TAKING A GAP YEAR I WAS TOO BURNT OUT FOR THIS SEMESTER I'M IN A REALLY BAD PLACE WITH MY ACADEMICS NOW
I TOOK A GAP YEAR AND STUDIED FOR THE PHD I SUCCESSFULLY PLACED INTO A TOP SCHOOL AFTER STUDYING FOR AND DOING WELL ON THE GRE SO IT'S POSSIBLE PROVIDED YOU HAVE THE RESOLVE TO STUDY DILIGENTLY THAT MEANS EVERY DAY FOR THE SUMMER LET ME KNOW IF YOU'D LIKE STUDY SUGGESTIONS

HOWEVER RATHER THAN TAKING A SHITTY JOB AS OTHERS RECOMMEND MIGHT I SUGGEST YOU LOOK INTO RESEARCH ASSOCIATE JOBS DURING THE INTERIM IT WOULD KEEP YOUR PHYSICS SHARP AND ALSO HELP YOUR ADMISSIONS RESULTS
I WAS ALWAYS TOLD THAT TAKING A GAP YEAR HURTS YOUR CHANCES OF GETTING INTO GRAD SCHOOL AND ALSO HURTS YOUR PERFORMANCE ONCE YOU DO GET IN UNLESS YOU SPEND THAT YEAR WORKING IN THE FIELD YOU EXPECT TO BE RESEARCHING ONCE YOU START GRAD SCHOOL I SEE SOME PEOPLE HERE ARE SAYING THE OPPOSITE SO I GUESS THAT ISN'T UNIVERSALLY TRUE BUT STILL IT'S PROBABLY SMART TO CHECK WITH THE DEPARTMENTS YOU MIGHT CONSIDER APPLYING TO AND SPECIFICALLY WITH THE PROFESSORS YOU'D WANT TO WORK WITH IF YOU KNOW TO SEE WHAT THEY SAY
IF YOU FEEL BURNT ON CLASSES AND HOMEWORK AND YOU'RE GENERALLY VERY TIRED MAYBE YOU SHOULD TAKE A GAP YEAR NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THESE REASONS BUT TO CLEAR YOUR MIND LITTLE BIT AND PERHAPS STUDY IN ADVANCE SO YOU CAN BE READY WHEN CLASSES START THAT WAY YOU'LL HAVE NICE MOMENTUM AND WON'T BE CONFUSED WITH ALL NEW STUFF YOU'LL GONNA LEARN ON LECTURES

MAKING A SHORT BRAKE ONE YEAR IS NOT A LONG TIME IN TERMS OF EDUCATION TRUST ME IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING AND IT CAN TURN OUT TO BE MUCH BETTER SOLUTION THAN GOING STRAIGHT TO GRE I WISH I MADE THAT BRAKE WHEN I HAD A CHANCE GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR DECISION
A GAP YEAR AS IN TRAVELING DOING THINGS NO WAY YOU WON'T STAY SHARP ENOUGH

A GAP YEAR AS IN STUDYING LEARNING PREPARING FOR GRAD SCHOOL IF YOUR WORK ETHIC IS GOOD ENOUGH SURE IF YOU'RE GOING TO SPEND THAT YEAR LEARNING IT'S FOR THE BETTER

I LEFT ACADEMIA MONTHS AGO AND HAVE ALREADY FORGOTTEN AN ABSOLUTE TON OF INFORMATION NO QUESTION ABOUT IT I'M CONSIDERABLY WORSE AS A PHYSICIST RIGHT NOW THAN I WAS A YEAR AGO
I'M DOING THE SAME MOSTLY BECAUSE I DIDN'T SIGN UP FOR THE AGRE THIS SEMESTER FOR FINANCIAL AND PERSONAL REASONS I WOULD RECOMMEND TALKING TO YOUR ADVISOR ADMISSIONS COMMITEE MINE RECOMMENDED TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL AND CONTINUING MY RESEARCH FOR A YEAR WHILE I STUDY FOR AGRE AND APPLY GOOD LUCK
I'M IN THE SAME BOAT MAYBE I'LL TRY TO FIND AN INTERNSHIP OVER THE SUMMER BEST OF LUCK
GET A JOB AND OR STUDENT EXCHANGE
DO IT MY BEST RECOMMENDATION IS TO FIND A JOB OR INTERNSHIP IN THAT GAP YEAR THAT IS SOMEWHAT RELATED TO SCIENCE USES ANALYTIC SKILLS YOU MENTIONED AN ENGINEERING JOB THAT COULD BE VERY USEFUL IF YOU WANT TO PURSUE EXPERIMENTAL WORK IN GRAD SCHOOL DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ALL YEAR AND DOESN'T HAVE TO BE DIRECTLY PHYSICS RELATED SOMETIMES IT'S NICE TO HAVE EXTRA SKILLS

I APPLIED TO GRAD SCHOOL MY 4TH YEAR OF COLLEGE AND WAS REJECTED DIDN'T HAVE A GREAT PHYSICS GRE AND MODERATE RESEARCH EXPERIENCE SO I APPLIED TO SOME INTERNSHIPS AND IN MY GAP YEAR I DID TWO JULI INTERNSHIPS AT DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY NATIONAL LABS IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE I WAS EXPOSED TO DIFFERENT FIELDS IN SCIENCE AND IT GAVE ME A LETTER OF RECORD MEANWHILE I DIDN'T HAVE CLASSES TO WORRY ABOUT SO I COULD DEDICATE MORE EFFORT TO PHYSICS GRE STUDYING AND THE APPLICATION ON A WHOLE

THE NEXT YEAR AND GOT INTO ONE OF MY TOP CHOICES THE GAP YEAR HELPS GIVE YOU SOME TIME TO BREATHE AND FIGURE OUT YOUR LIFE I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT
DO IT AND TAKE A REAL JOB IT WAS A BIG SANITY SAVER FOR ME AND IT MADE GRE STUDYING AND APPLICATIONS SO MUCH EASIER SINCE I DIDN'T HAVE CLASSWORK IT IS ALSO EXPERIENCE THAT DIFFERENTIATES YOU FROM OTHER CANDIDATES FOR JOBS AND IF YOU DO IT WELL IT HELPS YOU EXPAND YOUR NETWORK PLUS YOU MIGHT END UP WITH SOME ACTUAL SAVINGS AND NOT BE WITH AN EMPTY RETIREMENT ACCOUNT
I REALLY WISH I HAD TAKEN A YEAR OUT IN THE MIDDLE WAS JUST SO BURNT OUT AND MY FINAL DEGREE SUFFERED HERE YOUR FIRST 2 YEARS DONT COUNT TOWARDS YOUR DEGREE AT ALL SO I TNT MATTER THAN I HAD BURNT MYSELF OUT GETTING GOOD GRADES 1ST AND 2ND YEAR BECAUSE THE 2 YEARS THAT COUNTED AFTER WERE CRAP COZ I WAS FRIED IN THE BRAIN DEPARTMENT SO I TNT GET THE 1ST CLASS I WANTED
GAP YEARS ARE BETTER THAN EVER NOW WITH MOOCH STUDY HARD FOR FREE IN THE YEAR OFF AND THEN KNOW LOTS OF THE COURSE MATERIAL ALREADY WHEN YOU GET TO YOUR FIRST YEAR WHO KNOWS COLLEGES MIGHT SOMEDAY NOT EVEN BE NEEDED ANYMORE IF THE ONLINE COURSES ARE GOOD ENOUGH
I DID A GAP YEAR WORKING IN A LABORATORY I CAN'T SAY WHETHER IT HURT MY CHANCES OR NOT I DIDN'T HAVE TO TEST THE WATERS AS I DID GRAD SCHOOL IN THE LAB I WORKED IN

THE FIRST FEW MONTHS I WAS JUST VOLUNTEERING AND I WORKED AS A SERVER AT THE SAME TIME IT WAS A GOOD DECISION AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED IT GAVE ME THE CHANCE TO DO RESEARCH IN A LOW STRESS ENVIRONMENT THERE'S NO PRESSURE ON VOLUNTEERS

THE CONCEPTS I LEARNED IN UNDERGRAD BECAME MORE CLEAR WHEN I SAW THEM IN MY RESEARCH WHEN I WENT BACK TO GRAD SCHOOL I WAS MORE CAREFUL IN CHOOSING MY COURSES BECAUSE I KNEW WHAT I WANTED TO LEARN TO HELP ME SUCCEED IN MY RESEARCH

IF THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK IN A LAB I WOULD RECOMMEND A GAP YEAR IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE FOR ME
TOOK A GAP YEAR GOT A MEDIOCRE JOB IN AN AMAZING PLACE BEST DECISION I EVER MADE I THINK A COMPROMISE WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA PERHAPS GET A CRAPPY JOB TO COVER EXPENSES BUT DO RESEARCH IN SPARE TIME OR READ AHEAD IN YOUR TEXTBOOKS WHAT YOU SHOULD PROBABLY NOT DO THOUGH IS HANG AROUND YOUR COLLEGE TOWN AND REAP THE REWARDS OF AN UNDERGRADUATE LIFESTYLE WITH MINIMAL RESPONSIBILITIES THAT CAN GET COMFORTABLE WHICH IS KINDA SCARY
OK BACK UP THINK ABOUT IT THE ELECTRON IS JUST SITTING THERE AT REST MINDING IT'S OWN BUSINESS WHEN OUT OF NOWHERE AN ELECTRIC FIELD IS APPLIED LET'S REALLY LOOK AT THE FORM OF THE ELECTRIC FIELD GET THE LATEX SCRIPT SEE THE SIDEBAR

BOLDSYMBOL E T BOLDSYMBOL E SIN OMEGA T

IT'S SINE IT GOES AS SINE YOU CAN'T HEAR MY VOICE I'M NOT BEING CONDESCENDING I'M TRYING TO PUSH YOU TO THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS STOP NOW AND THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS

IMAGINE IT IN YOUR HEAD

LET TIME FLOW SLOWLY

WHAT'S THE INITIAL FORCE AT TIME T MAGNITUDE AND DIRECTION

OK THEN WHAT FOLLOW ALONG IN YOUR MIND FOR CYCLE OF THE SINE WAVE WHAT DO YOU SEE WHAT IS THE FORCE DOING WHAT IS THE ELECTRON MOTION

THE FORCE WAS ALWAYS IN THE SAME DIRECTION DURING THAT HALF CYCLE WASN'T IT WASN'T IT

YES YES IT WAS

SO NOW AT THE END OF THE FIRST HALF CYCLE WHEN T PI OMEGA WHAT'S THE FORCE MAGNITUDE AND DIRECTION WHAT ABOUT THE VELOCITY OF THE ELECTRON DIRECTION IS ENOUGH

OK SO NOW LET TIME FLOW FOR THE SECOND WHAT IS THE FORCE DOING WHICH DIRECTION IS IT POINTING WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE ELECTRON AS A RESULT

AFTER ONE FULL CYCLE WHAT IS THE VELOCITY OF THE ELECTRON MAGNITUDE AND DIRECTION WHAT ABOUT ITS POSITION RELATIVE TO ITS STARTING POINT EXACT NUMBERS AREN'T IMPORTANT HERE YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

SO THAT'S IT IF YOU CAN FOLLOW WHAT HAPPENS FOR ONE CYCLE YOU'VE GOT THE WHOLE THING IT JUST REPEATS AFTER THAT DOES THAT TAKE CARE OF IT I HOPE THIS FORMAT WAS HELPFUL AND NOT FRUSTRATING I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT YOU LEARN MORE WHEN YOU FIGURE THINGS OUT YOURSELF EVEN WITH A LITTLE GUIDANCE

IF THIS WAS JUST TOTALLY UNHELPFUL LET ME KNOW AND I'LL JUST SAY THE ANSWER IN ONE OR TWO SENTENCES

E TYPOS DERP

IMAGINE THAT THE ELECTRIC FIELD FOLLOWS A SIMPLE OSCILLATING FORM IN THE

E EO SIN WT

THEN APPLYING SECOND LAW WE HAVE THAT

MX QE CEO SIN WT

WHICH IS AN INHOMOGENEOUS SECOND ARDEN DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION IN TIME IT'S SOLUTION IS GIVEN BY THE SUPERPOSITION OF THE HOMOGENEOUS SOLUTION MX AND A PARTICULAR SOLUTION WITH AN OSCILLATING FORM X A SIN WT B COS WT

THE FIRST EQUATION TELLS YOU THAT THE ACCELERATION IS CERO SO THE ELECTRON MUST BE MOVING WITH CONSTANT VELOCITY AND THE SECOND EQUATION GIVES YOU AN OSCILLATING TERM SO YEAH THATS WHY
THIS SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE TRYING TO PAINT THE CLASSICAL PICTURE OF PHOTON PRESSURE IN A ROUNDABOUT WAY AN OSCILLATING ELECTRIC FIELD WILL IN TURN CREATE AND OSCILLATING MAGNETIC FIELD PERPENDICULAR TO THE OSCILLATIONS AND PHASE OFFSET THE ELECTRON WILL THEN MOVE UP AND DOWN WITH THE ELECTRIC FIELD AND THEN BE PUSHED FORWARD BY THE MAGNETIC FIELD

UNLESS I'VE MISUNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION IN WHICH CASE I'M NOT SURE WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO GET AT
IN QUANTUM FIELD THEORY EXISTENCE IS A SLIPPERY TERM THERE IS A FAMOUS PAPER BY ART HOBSON WHERE IT IS ARGUED THAT PARTICLES DON'T EVEN EXIST THEY ARE ONLY A USEFUL ANALOGY WHEN THE REAL OBJECT IS THE UNDERLYING QUANTUM FIELD

QUASIPARTICLE ARE ABOUT AS REAL AS A ELECTRON THOUGH THEY EXIST ONE LEVEL OF ABSTRACTION FURTHER HOW YOU REACT TO THAT IS UP TO TASTE

ESSENTIALLY THE QUASIPARTICLE ELECTRON IS A USEFUL FICTION DESCRIBING THE PROPERTIES OF A HUGE SWATHE ON THE ORDER OF NUMBER OF ELECTRONS INTERACTING WITH EACH OTHER AND SOME LATTICE EACH OF WHICH IS AS I SAID A USEFUL FICTION DESCRIBING THE REAL ELECTRON FIELD THOUGH AT THIS POINT NOBODY REALLY KNOWS WHAT'S REAL

PHYSICISTS ARE OFTEN MUCH MORE CONCERNED WITH WHAT ARE EMPIRICALLY OBSERVABLE THAN WHAT'S REAL AND FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW THE QUASIPARTICLE ELECTRON IS JUST AS EMPIRICALLY OBSERVABLE AS THE ELECTRON IT'S JUST LESS FUNDAMENTAL
I THINK YOU ARE CONFUSING BETWEEN DIFFERENT RENORMALIZATION SCALES REAL IS A VERY FISHY WORD
YOUR LANGUAGE IS VERY IMPRECISE UNDERSTANDABLY IT'S ENGLISH AND THE QUESTION IS RATHER VAGUE SO IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M MISUNDERSTANDING YOU BUT I THINK YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG IDEA ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE ARE CLAIMING

WHEN PEOPLE SAY THAT MEJORANA FERMIONS WERE DISCOVERED IN A MATERIAL NOBODY IS CLAIMING THAT THERE EXIST ELEMENTARY OR FUNDAMENTAL MEJORANA FERMIONS IT MEANS THAT THERE EXISTS A EXCITATION WITHIN A MATERIAL WHICH IF YOU LOOK AT HOW IT BEHAVES AT LOW ENERGIES CAN BE AS A MEJORANA FERMION MAJORANAS ARE CLAIMED TO BE REAL IN THIS SENSE

IF THIS STILL BOTHERS YOU LET ME ASK YOU ARE PROTONS REAL THE OBJECT THAT WE CALL A PROTON IS REALLY A DESCRIPTION OF THREE QUARKS WHICH ISN'T REALLY ACCURATE EITHER BECAUSE THE STRONG FORCE IS COMPLICATED DOES THIS MEAN THAT A PROTON ISN'T REAL YOU CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION HOWEVER YOU LIKE DEPENDING ON YOUR DEFINITION OF REAL BUT IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE AN DEFINITION UNDER WHICH THE PROTON ISN'T REAL
HEH I RECALL AN ANSWER TO A SIMILAR QUESTION GIVEN BY A CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICIST THAT WENT LIKE THIS

IN CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS WE CALL QUASIPARTICLE BY A DIFFERENT NAME PARTICLES

WHETHER THEY ARE FUNDAMENTAL OR EMERGENT IS NOT EXACTLY IMPORTANT IF IT LOOKS LIKE A DUCK AND IT QUACKS LIKE A DUCK AND IT IS TAXONOMICALLY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM A DUCK THEN IT'S A DUCK QUASIPARTICLE CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY DESCRIBED AS PARTICLES BY THE APPROPRIATE EQUATIONS GOVERNING PARTICLE BEHAVIOR ACCORDINGLY THEY DO QUALIFY AS ACTUAL PARTICLES JUST NOT ELEMENTARY ONES IT IS PERHAPS BEST TO THINK OF THEM AS AN EMERGENT PHENOMENON BUT THEY ARE STILL A REAL PHENOMENON
IF PARTICLES ARE JUST EXCITATIONS WITHIN ALL THE FIELDS THAT EXIST IN THE UNIVERSE THE FIELDS EXIST IN 3D RIGHT OR QUE TO QUANTIZED SPACE IS IT MORE LIKE LAYERS AND LAYERS OF SHEETS VERY CLOSE TOGETHER AREY THEY ORIENTATED IN ANY PARTICULAR WAY OR ARE THEY NOT LIKE FABRIC BUT POINTS THAT SNAP TO QUANTIZED POINTS THAT EITHER GAIN OR LOSE ENERGY LIKE GLOWING DOTS ON A GRID I'M STRUGGLING TO PICTURE IT I GUESS IT CAN'T REALLY BE IMAGINED ESPECIALLY WITH ADDITIONAL DIMENSIONS
IT WOULD SHOW YOU EARTH YEARS AGO LIGHT REFLECTED OFF OF EARTH WOULD TAKE YEARS TO GET TO THE MIRROR AND THEN YEARS TO GET BACK
I COULD SEE WHAT HAPPENED AT MY HOUSE FOUR EIGHT YEARS AGO RIGHT

IT'S PRETTY HARD TO SEE A HOUSE FROM A DISTANCE OF LY SO NO NOT REALLY I MEAN YOU COULD MAKE THE MIRROR OUTRAGEOUSLY HUGE AND CONCAVE TO FOCUS THE LIGHT BACK TO YOU YOU'D BASICALLY HAVE TO BUILD A SPHERICAL MIRROR OF LY DIAMETER AND PUT YOUR HOUSE IN THE CENTER OF IT IF YOU'RE WILLING TO DO THAT THEN SURE ABSOLUTELY
NOPE

SCENARIO YOU INSTANTLY TRAVEL LIGHT YEARS DISTANCE PLACE A MIRROR ANGLED BACK TO YOUR ORIGINAL POSITION THEN INSTANTLY TELEPORT BACK TO YOUR INITIAL POSITION

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU LOOK BACK AT THE MIRROR YOU SEE NOTHING FOR FOUR YEARS YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE LIGHT BEING REFLECTED OFF THE MIRROR TO REACH YOUR ORIGINAL POSITION

IN YEARS TIME YOU WOULD SEE WHAT HAPPENED YEARS FROM WHEN YOU PLACED THE MIRROR OR YEARS IN THE PAST
WELL YES AND NUMBER IF YOU JAD NOTHING TO DO WITH PUTTING THE MIRROR THERE AND IT'S JUST THERE THAN YES IF PUTTING THE MIRROR THERE IS PART OF THE THOUGHT EXPERIMENT THAN YOU CAN'T SEE ANY TIME BEFORE YOU LEFT TO PUT THE MIRROR THERE THE REASON BEING THAT YOU CAN'T TRAVEL FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT SO COIR JOURNEY TO PLACE THE MIRROR AND COME BACK MUST NECESSARILY BE LONGER THAN YEARS

OF COURSE RECORDING THINGS WITH A CAMERA IS PROBABLY AN EASIER SOLUTION
THANKS FOR ALL THOSE ANSWERS I DEFINITELY GOT THE CONFIRMATION NOW IF I'D PLACE A MIRROR RIGHT NOW IN DISTANCE BY SNIPPING MY FINGER I'D HAVE TO WAIT EIGHT YEARS THEN I'D SEE WHAT HAPPENS YEARS AGO

PERFECT THANK YOU ALL

I WAS KIND OF CONFUSED WITH THE TITLE HERE FROM PURDUE UNIVERSITY INITIALLY THE TITTLE SEEMS TO SUGGEST WEAK ATOMIC BOND WAS OBSERVED FOR FIRST TIME BUT THE ARTICLE ITSELF ACTUALLY SAYS A SPECIAL TYPE OF WEAK ATOMIC BOND WAS OBSERVED FOR THE FIRST TIME PROVING THE EXISTENCE OF BUTTERFLY RYDBERG MOLECULE

THE ARTICLE ITSELF IS VERY CONCISE IT'S A PLEASANT READ

IV JUST STARTED MY MASTERS IN PHYSICS AFTER FINISHING MY BSC I HAVE FRIENDS STUDYING ECONOMICS AND I THINK THAT IF YOU CAN GRASP THE MATHS AND MODELS IN ECONOMICS YOU SHOULD BE FINE WITH PHYSICS IT'S ALL ABOUT THE TIME AND EFFORT YOU PUT IN AS LONG AS YOU ARE MOTIVATED ENOUGH TO TEACH YOURSELF MATHS AND APPLY IT TO PHYSICS YOU SHOULD BE FINE GOOD LUCK
YOUR BACKGROUND CERTAINLY SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR A PHYSICS MASTERS YOU WOULD NEED TO LOOK AT THE ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS FOR SPECIFIC PROGRAMS TO SEE IF YOU COULD GET IN THOUGH IN MY COUNTRY AUSTRALIA YOUR UNDERGRAD DEGREE MAY BE CONSIDERED TOO FAR REMOVED FROM PHYSICS TO GET IN YOUR RESEARCH EXPERIENCE SAYS OTHERWISE THOUGH SO YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND A SCHOOL THAT WILL LET YOU IN
WHAT LEVEL OF MATH DID YOU GET TO WITH ECONOMICS CURIOUS AS TO WHAT IS REQUIRED
THE MATH YOU NEED IS CALCULUS VECTOR CALCULUS PDES COMPLEX ANALYSIS AND LINEAR ALGEBRA I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE THAT IN MY PAST PERSONAL EXPERIENCE ECONOMISTS AND ECON MAJORS TEND TO HAVE VERY LIMITED MATH BACKGROUNDS AND A GREAT APTITUDE FOR ABUSING WHAT THEY DO KNOW BUT I'M SURE THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW REALISTICALLY WHY A GRAD SCHOOL WOULD BOTHER TAKING A STUDENT WITH NO PHYSICS BACKGROUND EVEN IF THEIR GRADES WERE STELLAR WOULDN'T IT BE FAR SIMPLER TO TAKE SOME PHYSICS COURSES BEFORE YOU GRADUATE
A PRETTY DIFFICULT CHOICE I HAVE UNFINISHED IN PHILOLOGY PHILOSOPHY INFORMATION MANAGEMENT

I CONSIDER MYSELF GIFTED WITH OR SO IQ BUT NO I WOULDN'T TOUCH PHYSICS MASTER WITHOUT ENGINEERING PHYSICS BA

PLEASE SAVE SOME TIME AND DO A BA IN THESE FIELDS EVEN IF IT SEEMS A LOT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF MATH IS SO COMPLEX PEOPLE SAY THAT DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS ARE GAME SO START WITH BA LEVEL MATHS AND GET VERY GOOD AT THEM USING ANY OF BA S I MENTIONED EARLIER
WHO WAS SURPRISED AT THE MASSES
NOT SURE HOW MUCH GW OBSERVATION WILL CONSTRAIN THEORIES IN BASIC PHYSICS BUT THERE SHOULD BE SOME VERY INTERESTING THINGS COMING OUT ON THE ASTROPHYSICS SIDE STELLAR ASTROPHYSICS SUPERNOVAE ARBS ETC NUMERICAL RELATIVITY WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT FIELD TO GET STARTED IN A FEW YEARS AGO
I DON'T BELIEVE IT WILL AFFECT ANY THEORETICAL RESEARCH IT'S NOT A NEW THING IT'S CONFIRMATION OF A VERY OLD THING IT WILL HOWEVER LEAD INTO A NEW AGE OF GRAVITATIONAL ASTRONOMY
SORRY HE'S LBS
TRY R THEYDIDTHEMATH IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY
THE BIGGEST FACTOR IS NOT YOUR FIELD OF RESEARCH BUT THE SKILLS YOU PICKED UP ALONG THE WAY ULTIMATELY THE ONE THING EMPLOYERS ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT IS WHAT YOU CAN BRING TO THE TABLE OF COURSE THE SPECIFICS WILL THEN DEPEND ON WHAT EXACTLY YOU WANT TO DO IN THE REAL WORLD IF YOU WANT TO DO A VERY TECHNICAL JOB EAST G WORKING ON NEW LASER SYSTEMS THEN OBVIOUSLY FAMILIARITY WITH BUILDING AND MAINTAINING LASERS WILL BE A HUGE HELP IF YOU WANT TO GO INTO SOMETHING LIKE DATA SCIENCE THEN WHAT THEY WILL LOOK FOR IS A COMBINATION OF GENERAL PROGRAMMING SKILLS AND A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF STATISTICS FOR CONSULTING THE ABILITY TO MAKE PRETTY PRESENTATIONS AND COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY WILL COUNT MORE THAN MUCH OF THE TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE YOU AMASSED PUT TOGETHER

THE BEST ADVICE I HAVE IS TRY TO DECIDE RELATIVITY EARLY EAST G AT LEAST A YEAR BEFORE GRADUATING WHAT YOU WANT TO DO AFTERWARDS THEN IT BECOMES EASIER TO WORK ON THE SKILLS THAT WOULD MAKE YOU MORE EMPLOYABLE IN YOUR FIELD OF CHOICE FOR EXAMPLE FOR DATA SCIENCE YOU COULD START PUTTING SMALL PROJECTS ON GITHUB AND POLISHING THEM ALONG THE WAY THEN YOU WOULD HAVE SOMETHING TANGIBLE TO SHOW EMPLOYERS THAT PROVES YOU ARE CAPABLE OF DOING THE WORK LIKEWISE YOU HAVE TO START TALKING TO PEOPLE IN THOSE FIELDS DOING AN INTERNSHIP OR A BRIEF WORK VISIT IS ONE OF THE BEST WAY TO GET YOUR FOOT IN THE DOOR SO TO SPEAK OTHERWISE EVEN SITTING DOWN WITH PEOPLE WORKING AT SIMILAR COMPANIES FOR AN INFORMATIONAL INTERVIEW MIGHT BE QUITE HELPFUL

HOWEVER I CAN'T EMPHASIZE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS JUST TO START TALKING TO PEOPLE IN YOUR FUTURE FIELD NETWORKING MAY SOUND LIKE A DIRTY WORD BUT IT'S INCREDIBLY HELPFUL BY TALKING TO PEOPLE ALREADY WORKING IN THE KIND OF JOB YOU WANT YOU CAN GET A MUCH BETTER SENSE OF WHAT THE DAY TO DAY WORK IS LIKE AND WHAT SKILLS ARE USEFUL MORE IMPORTANTLY BY MAKING CONNECTIONS YOU CAN HAVE A CONTACT PERSON TO SEND YOUR RESUME TO THE RIGHT HIRING MANAGER WHEN YOU ARE READY TO APPLY FOR A JOB THIS SIMPLE STEP CAN BE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AS IT CAN OFFER A SHORTCUT TO A PHONE SITE INTERVIEW OTHERWISE YOU WILL BE STUCK DEALING WITH HR AS A FIRST STEP WHICH CAN BE INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING AND OFTEN FRUITLESS

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING I PICKED UP IOS DEVELOPMENT AS A HOBBY WHILE IN GRAD SCHOOL SILICON VALLEY WORSHIPS PHYSICISTS YOU'LL STILL NEED DEMONSTRABLE APPS TO SHOW OFF IN THE APP STORE AND WHAT NOT TO GET A JOB BUT PEOPLE TEND TO ASSUME I'M A GENIUS AND ASK QUESTIONS LATER
MEDICAL PHYSICS IS A GREAT CAREER OPTION ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THEM IN ONCOLOGY

EXPERIMENTAL SOLID STATE PHYSICS OR EXPERIMENTAL POLYMER WILL PROBABLY GIVE YOU THE STRONGEST POTENTIAL FOR AN INDUSTRY JOB THAT IS VERY CLOSE TO YOUR FIELD
THE HIGGS FIELD IS PRETTY HOT CURRENTLY
EM
YOU WERE SO CLOSE WITH THAT LINK
NOTHING REVOLUTIONARY OR LIKELY UNEXPECTED GETTING DEFINITE PROOF FOR THE GRAVITON WOULD SIMPLY MEAN THAT THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD IS QUANTIZED SIMILAR TO THE ELECTROMAGNETIC EM FIELD EVEN THOUGH IT IS A PAIN IN THE ASS TO OBSERVE THE GRAVITON INDIRECT EVIDENCE ALREADY ALLOWS US TO SAY QUITE A BIT ABOUT IT RECENTLY THE FIGO EXPERIMENTS ALREADY SUPPORTED THE IDEA THAT CHANGES IN THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD PROPAGATE AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT AS A CONSEQUENCE THE GRAVITON APPEARS TO BE MASSLESS ALSO BECAUSE WE KNOW THE GRAVITON HAS TO COUPLE TO THE TENSOR WE KNOW THAT ITS SPIN MUST BE 2 BUT LIKE I SAID WE ALREADY THINK WE KNOW MANY OF THESE PROPERTIES OF THE GRAVITON WITHOUT ACTUALLY OBSERVING IT OF COURSE IT WOULD BE EXCITING IF SOMETHING NEW POPPED UP THEN WE COULD WORK ON REVISING OUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF PHYSICS AND PERHAPS EVEN REFINE MODELS TRYING TO PULL TOGETHER GRAVITY AND PARTICLE PHYSICS
ISN'T GRAVITON JUST HIGGS BOSON THAT'S WHAT WE LEARNT IN PHYSICS AROUND HALF A YEAR AGO AND ISN'T HIGGS BOSON ALREADY DISCOVERED
IF IT HELPS IT'S ALSO A PIPE DREAM OF MINE TO BE AN ASTRONAUT

I'D HATE TO TRAMPLE YOUR DREAMS BUT DOES AUSTRALIA SEND PEOPLE INTO SPACE THE US RUSSIA AND CHINA I'D ASSUME ARE THE ONLY GAMES IN TOWN FOR MANNED SPACE TRAVEL

REGARDLESS I'D ASSUME THAT SOMETHING LIKE ENGINEERING IS MORE ON A CAREER PATH TO ASTRONAUT THAN RADIO ASTRONOMY I MAY BE SHOWING MY OWN IGNORANCE BUT RADIO WAVES ARE PRETTY BIG SO I DON'T THINK WE DO ANY RADIO ASTRONOMY IN SPACE SEE THE KILOMETER SIZE OF THE SQUARE KILOMETER ARRAY

AS FOR ASTRONOMY VS MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS I'D BE INCLINED TO SAY THAT MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS OFFERS YOU MORE PIVOTS FOR A POST PHYSICS CAREER WHICH SADLY IS A SERIOUS CONSIDERATION THAT ANY PHYSICS UNDERGRAD SHOULD CONSIDER THAT BEING SAID IF YOUR GRADES ARE GREAT AND YOU SHOW STRONG INTEREST AT WORKING AT THE SKA FOR SOME UNDERGRAD RESEARCH I WOULDN'T IMAGINE IT MATTERS TOO MUCH WHAT COURSES YOU'VE DONE AS LONG AS YOU'RE IN PHYSICS AT THE UNDERGRAD LEVEL NO ONE IS EXPECTING SUPER SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE


THIS IS REALLY UP TO YOU THE INTERNET CAN'T REALLY HELP YOU HERE PERSONALLY I THINK ASTROPHYSICS IS COOLER BUT THAT'S ME
YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S AN ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PHYSICS TEXTBOOKS AND POPULAR SCIENCE BOOKS ON PHYSICS READING A POPULAR SCIENCE BOOK IS A LARGELY UNRELATED ACTIVITY TO STUDYING PHYSICS SO WITH THIS UNDERSTANDING YOU NEED TO CLARIFY WHAT YOU MEAN BY AN INTRODUCTION

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON IS NOT A PHYSICIST HE'S AN EDUTAINER AND CELEBRITY AND STEPHEN HAWKING HAS WRITTEN NO INTRODUCTORY TEXTS THAT I KNOW OF SO I ASSUME YOU MEAN POPULAR SCIENCE BOOKS IF YOUR GOAL IS POPULAR SCIENCE BOOKS THEN I WOULDN'T IMAGINE IT MATTERS TO MUCH IN WHAT ORDER YOU READ THEM AS THEY'RE ALL OSTENSIBLY WRITTEN FOR A FIRST READER HOWEVER NONE OF THESE ARE INTRODUCTORY PHYSICS BOOKS THOSE WOULD BE THE BOOKS THAT WOULD BE IN A PHYSICS CLASS AND WOULD REQUIRE A BACKGROUND IN CALCULUS
I'VE BEEN READING THE FEYNMAN LECTURES ON PHYSICS RECENTLY THE WRITING IS VERY CLEAR AND ENTERTAINING IT'S ALL FREELY AVAILABLE ON WEBSITE HERE
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A TEXT BOOK THERE ARE A BUNCH OF SOLID INTRO LEVEL MECHANICS AND ELECTRICITY BOOKS TO GET YOU STARTED UNIVERSITY PHYSICS COMES TO MIND AS A PRETTY CLEAR CUT BOOK YOU'LL NEED TO KNOW CALCULUS THROUGH MULTI TO DO THE ELECTRICITY STUFF THOUGH ANOTHER RESOURCE WOULD BE THE KHAN ACADEMY PHYSICS SEQUENCE PRIMARILY BECAUSE IT'S FREE AND TYPICALLY WELL TAUGHT

IF YOU'RE LOOKING MORE FOR A POP SCIENCE BOOK SERIES WHERE YOU CAN TAKE IN A LOT OF TOPICS FROM A CONCEPTUAL LEVEL BUT NOT MATHEMATICALLY I'D SAY START BY WATCHING COSMOS SINCE ITS PRETTY EASY TO UNDERSTAND OR SOME OF THE SCIENCE CHANNELS ONE OFF SHOWS ABOUT THE UNIVERSE AT LEAST THAT'S HOW I GOT MY START AFTER THAT YOU PROBABLY CAN'T REALLY GO WRONG WITH ANY POP SCI BOOKS THEY'LL BE TARGETED TOWARDS PEOPLE WITH MINIMAL BACKGROUND
TRY QED BY FEYNMAN I'M CURRENTLY READING IT AND I'M LIKING IT IT'S NOT REALLY POPULAR LIKE THE USUAL POPULAR PHYSICS BOOKS READ IT BY YOURSELF AND YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN
I'M A BIG FAN OF MUNCASTER OR DUNCAN IF YOU WANT A GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO PHYSICS AT COLLEGE LEVEL THEY'RE FAIRLY OLD SO YOU CAN GET THEM QUITE CHEAP
UNDERSTANDING MATHEMATICS AT LEAST THROUGH CALCULUS IS ESSENTIAL TO UNDERSTANDING PHYSICS IF YOU HAVEN'T TAKEN A PRECALCULUS COURSE YET OR IF YOU JUST NEED A REFRESHER START WITH BASIC MATHEMATICS BY LANGUAGE IT CONTAINS MOST OF THE PREREQUISITE TOPICS FOR CALCULUS IT ALSO CONTAINS A NICE RANGE OF PROBLEMS FROM ROUTINE COMPUTATIONS TO APPLICATIONS OF CONCEPTS AFTER YOU FINISH YOU CAN MOVE ONTO CALCULUS BOOKS A FIRST COURSE IN CALCULUS AND CALCULUS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES AND THEN YOU'RE READY FOR INTRODUCTORY PHYSICS

PHYSICS VOLUMES AND 2 BY HALLIDAY RESNICK AND KRANE IS A GREAT INTRODUCTORY TEXTBOOK BECAUSE IT BALANCES DERIVING AND DISCUSSING CONCEPTS THIS IS A GENERAL PHYSICS TEXTBOOK THAT COVERS MECHANICS THERMODYNAMICS ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM OPTICS SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND QUANTUM MECHANICS THE FOURTH EDITION IS SUFFICIENT AND SECONDHAND COPIES ARE USUALLY INEXPENSIVE AFTER READING PHYSICS YOU'LL BE ABLE TO MOVE ONTO MORE ADVANCED OR SPECIALIZED TOPICS IT MIGHT ALSO BE BENEFICIAL TO LEARN MORE MATHEMATICS THROUGH LINEAR ALGEBRA OR PROBABILITY

GOOD LUCK AND FEEL FREE TO COMMENT OR MESSAGE ME IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ALONG THE WAY
I COULD BE WRONG BUT WHENEVER I HEAR PENROSE SPEAK HIS IDEAS ALWAYS SOUND WELL-FORMED BUT UNCONVENTIONAL HE SIMPLY DOESN'T CARE WHAT THE GENERAL OPINION IS HE ALWAYS FORMS HIS OWN IDEAS BASED ON WHAT HE KNOWS

IT TAKES A SPECIAL KIND OF MIND TO BE ABLE TO DEVIATE FROM THE NORM AND STILL MAKE SENSE IT'S EASY TO DEVIATE FROM THE NORM MAKE NONSENSE IF YOU WANT DEVIANT NONSENSE IDEAS GO TO YOUTUBE

I THINK WE NEED MORE PEOPLE LIKE PENROSE
SOOOOOO THIS GUY IS SAYING SOME OUTRAGEOUS THINGS THAT HOPEFULLY SOMEONE WHO KNOWS MORE CAN CLEAR UP FOR ME

UNITARILY DOESN'T HAVE TO BE CONSERVED

THE MOMENTUM SHOULD BE EXCITING MORE DIMENSIONS

COHERENT SUPERPOSITIONS OF HIGH MASS WILL COLLAPSE BY THEMSELVES WITHOUT MEASUREMENT

IT IS IMPROBABLE THAT OUR UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING UNIFORMLY AND IMPROBABLE THAT THE BIG BANG HAPPENED FOR THE SAME REASON

NOW UNITARILY HAS ALWAYS FELT LIKE YOU KNOW AN OBVIOUS THING PROBABILITIES SUM TO THE CONCEPT OF A PROBABILITY GREATER THAN SIMPLY DOESN'T EXIST IN PROBABILITY THEORY

THEN THE MOMENTUM DOESN'T THE EXCITATION OF EXTRA DIMENSIONS HAVE TO DO WITH ENERGY DENSITY IN WHICH CASE THERE'S NOT REALLY A HIGH ENERGY DENSITY AT ANY POINT WITHIN THE EARTH

AS FOR COHERENT SUPERPOSITIONS AS FAR AS I KNOW THIS MIGHT BE THE CASE BUT THEY WOULD ALSO OSCILLATE TO ONE THEN TO THE OTHER AND SO ON THIS IS NORMAL AND ACCEPTED HE SEEMS TO BE SAYING THAT ONCE THEY OSCILLATE TO ONE STATE THEY WILL NEVER GO BACK PERIOD NO CASE OF A LONG LONG PERIOD OF THE FUNCTION

THE LAST ONE I DON'T REALLY KNOW MUCH ABOUT BUT IT SEEMS ODD NONETHELESS
INTERESTING QUESTION I HAD NEVER HEARD OF THIS BEFORE

SAY YOU HAVE COMPLETED THE PULLEY STITCH UP TO THE POINT SHOWN IN THE RIGHT-HAND FIGURE I'M GUESSING THE NEXT STEP IS TO PULL ON THE THREADS AND THE WHOLE THING PULLS TOGETHER AND CLOSES UP YOU PULL WITH SOME AMOUNT OF FORCE CALL IT T FOR TENSION ON EACH THREAD THE TOTAL SIDEWAYS COMPONENT OF THE FORCE CALL IT TX ON EACH SIDE IS WHAT ACTUALLY PULLS THE WOUND CLOSED BUT SINCE THE THREAD IS STITCHED THROUGH THE TISSUE TWICE IT PULLS ON THE TISSUE TWICE SO YOUR THREAD IS PULLING THE WOUND CLOSED WITH A FORCE OF

SO I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THE ADVANTAGE THE STITCH PRODUCES A FORCE MULTIPLIER IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO CALL IT THE PULLEY STITCH IN THAT CASE SINCE A SYSTEM OF PULLEYS PROVIDES A SIMILAR MECHANICAL ADVANTAGE FROM A MECHANICS PERSPECTIVE THIS WOULD BE DESIRABLE IF YOU WANTED TO EITHER A USE THE SAME THREAD TENSION AS IN THE SIMPLE INTERRUPTED STITCH BUT GET MORE OVERALL PULLING FORCE ON THE WOUND OR B USE LESS TENSION AS IN THE SIMPLE INTERRUPTED STITCH BUT GET THE SAME OVERALL PULLING FORCE ON THE WOUND

AS FOR THE SPACING OF THE ENTRY EXIT POINTS I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY MECHANICAL ADVANTAGE THE THREADS ARE MEANT TO PULL THE TISSUE CLOSED LATERALLY SO IT'S THE FORCE THAT MATTERS NOT TORQUE WHICH IS WHAT LEVERAGE MULTIPLIES WHICH IS NOT DEPENDENT ON THE POINT OF APPLICATION I THINK THE SPACING OF THE ENTRY EXIT POINTS WOULD ONLY DEPEND ON WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE HEALTH OF THE TISSUE
SIGMA FOR ACCELERATED EXPANSION IN AN UNCONSTRAINED MODEL BUT JUST IN A FLAT UNIVERSE HOW DOES THAT WORK WITHOUT HEAVILY DISFAVORING A FLAT UNIVERSE I ALSO DON'T SEE THE SIGMA VALUE FROM THE ABSTRACT ANYWHERE IN THE TEXT THE TEXT COMPARES UNCONSTRAINED TO CONSTRAINED MODELS WHERE THE FLAT UNIVERSE LEADS TO A HIGHER SIGNIFICANCE AS EXPECTED ALSO IN AGREEMENT WITH FIGURES 2 AND

I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS SIGMA VALUE IN THE ABSTRACT
GREAT PAPER LOTS MORE SIGMAS THAN I THOUGHT WE HAD
THIS WAS IN RESPONSE TO A PAPER BY SOME COLLEAGUES OF MINE WHICH DID A STATISTICAL REANALYSIS OF A LARGE PORTION OF THE DATA AND FOUND THAT IT IS CONSISTENT WITH NO ACCELERATION THIS NEW PAPER THAT CAME OUT THE OTHER DAY SEEMS TO SAY THAT THERE ARE SOME CORRELATIONS IN THE PRIORS THAT WEREN'T PROPERLY ACCOUNTED FOR
IS THAT NOT WHAT THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNER AND RIESS FROM HOPKINS CALCULATED
THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS ACTUALLY QUITE A COMPLICATED BEAST HERE IS A PICTURE OF THE VARIATION IN INTENSITY OVER THE ENTIRE SURFACE YOU CAN SEE THAT EVEN WITHOUT ACCOUNTING FOR THE DIRECTION OF THE FIELD LINES THERE ISN'T GOING TO BE A SIMPLE EQUATION TO DESCRIBE THIS WITH ANY KIND OF ACCURACY

THE NEXT BEST THING IS CALLED THE WORLD MAGNETIC MODEL WHICH SOME GENEROUS PEOPLE HAVE MADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE FOR EXACTLY THE KIND OF PURPOSES THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING


MY APPROACH WAS TO TRY TO GET A JOB AFTER UNDERGRAD AND IF THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT GO TO GRAD SCHOOL I GOT A PROGRAMMING JOB WITHIN MONTHS AND HAVE NEVER LOOKED BACK I DON'T THINK I CAN GO BACK TO THE STUDENT LIFE I LOVE GETTING OFF OF WORK AND NOT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT HOMEWORK THAT AND MONEY
ZERO REGRETS I DID THE MASTERS PHD ROUTE SO I WAS IN GRAD SCHOOL FOR YEARS THOSE YEARS WERE AWESOME I WAS PAID SHIT BUT I GOT TO LIVE IN REALLY INTERESTING PLACES AND DO WORK AND PLAY WITH TOYS I WOULD NEVER GET TO TOUCH IN INDUSTRY THE HOURS AND THE WORKLOAD SUCKED BUT THAT EBBED AND FLOWED I'M MUCH HAPPIER WITH A VARIABLE WORKLOAD LIKE THAT THEN THE TO GRIND

AFTER GRADUATION I DID GET A JOB THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO GET WITHOUT A GRAD DEGREE AND IT'S A PRETTY AWESOME JOB I VERY LIKELY COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH FARTHER AHEAD ON THE NET EARNINGS CURVE IF I HAD STARTED WORKING STRAIGHT OUT OF UNDERGRAD BUT MY SALARY WOULD HAVE CAPPED OUT BELOW WHAT I'M MAKING NOW I ALSO WOULD NOT BE IN A POSITION THAT I ENJOY AS MUCH AS I DO MY CURRENT ONE

I THINK MY EXPERIENCE MAY BE ATYPICAL THOUGH MY PHD WAS SUPER HEAVY IN EXPERIMENTALISM TO THE POINT I WAS DOING HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE DESIGN SYSTEMS ENGINEERING PLANNING FIELD CAMPAIGNS ETC ALL JUST TO SUPPORT MY ACTUAL PHD RESEARCH THAT YEARS OF FULL SCOPE ENGINEERING EXPERIENCE IS WHAT I THINK PAID OFF FOR ME IN THE LONG RUN
I GOT A PHYSICS PHD AT BERKELEY THEN WENT INTO INDUSTRY SILICON VALLEY AND NEVER LOOKED BACK

SOME MIGHT CONSIDER MY DEGREE A WASTE IN THAT I'M NOT DOING PHYSICS IN MY CAREER TODAY PERSONALLY THOUGH I VIEW IT AS A FIRST CAREER I GOT A CHANCE TO DO SOME INTERESTING RESEARCH AT THE CUTTING EDGE OF MY FIELD AND I HAD A GOOD ALBEIT LIFE WHILE I WAS DOING IT I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED SCIENCE AND IF I'D NEVER DONE GRAD SCHOOL I KNOW I WOULD HAVE ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT I MISSED

ALSO I THINK THE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN VALUABLE TO MY CAREER IF ONE LOOKS BEYOND THE IMMEDIATE GRAD SCHOOL TAUGHT ME HOW TO WORK INDEPENDENTLY AND SOLVE ANALYTICAL PROBLEMS WITH NO CLEAR ANSWERS THAT'S A SKILL THAT CAN APPLY TO ALMOST ANYTHING
JUST STARTED MY PHD THIS SEMESTER I'VE LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT SO FAR I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND PHYSICS MORE THE WORKING ENVIRONMENT IS FANTASTIC AND I'M EXPOSED TO MORE IDEAS AND FIELDS AT A DIFFERENT INSTITUTION THAN I WAS AT IN UNDERGRAD THE PAY IS ACTUALLY PRETTY SOLID AND IS ONLY A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF WHAT I WAS OFFERED TO WORK IN IT OUT OF THE GATE BUT CERTAINLY LIVABLE IF I HAD ENDED UP TAKING THE JOB I'D PROBABLY JUST SPEND MY FREE TIME DICKING AROUND ANYWAY YOU'RE BURDENED WITH MORE LAB RESPONSIBILITY IN UNDERGRAD WHICH CAN BE STRESSFUL BUT ADVISORS ARE WILLING TO INVEST MORE INTO YOU
WORKING ON MY MD CURRENTLY

SOMETIMES I REGRET IT ONLY BECAUSE THE PROBLEM SOLVING THAT COMES WITH PHYSICS SEEMS MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE THAN MEMORIZING STUFF FOR HOURS A DAY

BUT ON THE OTHER HAND EMPLOYMENT WAS A HUGE FEAR FOR ME DEF DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH YEARS OF A PHD YEARS POST DOC AND FIND NO WORK DIDN'T WANT TO JUMP THROUGH THE HOOPS OF GRANT REQUESTS AND CHASING TENURE LIKE A MADMAN

PLUS WHEN I GO TO THE CLINIC IT MAKES ME DOING WHAT I'M DOING WORTH IT I MISS LEARNING GR AND QM AND FEELING KICKLESS BEHIND A CHALKBOARD BUT I REALIZED AT SOME POINT THAT PHYSICS IN MY MIND WAS MORE OF A DREAM THAN REALITY
I JUST GOT MY UNDERGRAD AND WENT STRAIGHT TO WORK FOR THE STATE AS A HEALTH PHYSICIST MONEY SUCKS BUT LIKE THE OTHER GUY SAID NOT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT HOMEWORK OR EXAMS IS A DREAM COME TRUE I DON'T REGRET NOT GETTING MY MASTERS BUT I'M STILL OPEN TO THE IDEA OF GOING BACK IN A FEW YEARS WHILE I'M STILL YOUNG AND NOT TIED DOWN
I STARTED WORKING MONTHS AFTER GETTING MY BS IN PHYSICS I'M HONESTLY CONSIDERING GOING BACK TO SCHOOL TO GET A MASTERS BECAUSE I FEEL THERE'S NOT MUCH PROFESSIONAL GROWTH WORKING IN THE INDUSTRY
MY WIFE AND I BOTH HAVE MASTER'S AND WE BOTH GOT JOBS THAT WE COULD HAVE GOTTEN WITH JUST IF I HAD TO DO IT AGAIN I WOULDN'T GO TO GRAD SCHOOL
YEAH I WAS ACCEPTED TO A PHD PROGRAM IN ECONOMICS BUT I DON'T THINK IT WOULD HAVE REALLY HELPED MY CAREER AND WOULD HAVE MADE MY LIFE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FINANCIALLY AND WORK LIFE BALANCE I THINK IT WAS THE RIGHT MOVE NOT TO GO BUT I WILL ALWAYS REGRET IT
GRAD SCHOOL IS WEIRD I DIDN'T GET INTO PHYSICS GRAD SCHOOL SO I SHOT FOR SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING GRAD SCHOOL NOW AFTER A YEAR AND A HALF IN OF A PHD I'M LEAVING WITH A MASTERS BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO DO SCHOOL ANYMORE

GRAD SCHOOL IS FOR IF YOU WANT TO DO ACADEMIA
I'M CURRENTLY IN MY SECOND YEAR OF GRAD SCHOOL AND I DON'T HAVE ANY REGRETS SOMETIMES I WONDER HOW LIFE WOULD CHANGE IF I STARTED A CAREER RIGHT AWAY BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY I'M LOVING THE MIX OF LEARNING AND RESEARCH

NOT GOING TO LIE IT CAN BE A HUGE ADJUSTMENT FROM UNDERGRAD TO GRADUATE AS A FRIEND PUT IT WHEN YOU LOOK BACK A FEW SEMESTERS IN YOU REALLY SEE THE BENEFIT AND STRENGTHENED SKILLS
I HAVEN'T GONE BACK TO GRAD SCHOOL AND I'M REGRETTING IT COULD JUST BE WHERE I'M FROM THERE'S A SMALL SCIENCE MARKET BUT I NEED TO GO BACK TO BECOME SPECIALIZED IN SOMETHING IM TUTORING FOR A GOOD COMPANY AND MONEY IS OK BUT NOT WHAT I EXPECTED
DID MY BS THEN GOT A JOB AT A STARTUP COMPANY ENDED UP HATING THE JOB AND WENT BACK FOR MY MASTERS ONE YEAR AFTER GRADUATING I WENT TO A SCHOOL WITH A TERMINAL MASTERS DEGREE AND DON'T REGRET IT AT ALL I FEEL LIKE I LEARNED WAY MORE BY PURSUING THE MASTERS
I REGRET ENROLLING IN A PHYSICS PHD PROGRAM I'M NOW TRYING TO LEAVE WITH A MASTER'S IN STATISTICS
STARTED WORKING IN IT NOW AND NEVER LOOKED BACK I MAKE MORE THAN MY SISTER WITH A LAW DEGREE AND HUGE AMOUNTS OF DEBIT I'M AT RIGHT NOW
DECIDED AT THE LAST MINUTE NOT TO APPLY TO PHYSICS GRAD SCHOOL AND NOW WORK IN BUSINESS RATHER THAN ACADEMIA OR INDUSTRY I FEEL WISTFUL ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AND DO MISS WORKING ON PHYSICS BUT IN GENERAL THE LIFESTYLE MONEY PACE OF THE LIFE I CHOSE WAS A MUCH BETTER FIT FOR ME I'VE HEARD IT SAID THAT YOU SHOULD ONLY DO A PHD IF YOU CAN'T IMAGINE BEING HAPPY NOT DOING ONE WHICH DOESN'T SOUND TOO WRONG A MASTERS ISN'T A BIG DEAL EITHER WAY ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE FUNDED
THE PHD WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE FOR ME BUT IT'S PROBABLY NOT THE RIGHT CHOICE FOR YOU
I HAVEN'T EVEN FINISHED MY UNDERGRAD AND I ALREADY DON'T REGRET NOT DOING GRAD SCHOOL I JUST DON'T LIKE SCHOOL
WHAT ABOUT PAIRING A B SOUTH IN PHYSICS WITH A MASTER'S IN SOME FLAVOR OF ENGINEERING
IN PHYSICS WITH MINOR IN CHEM YR IN THE MIDDLE OF A MASTERS PROGRAM INVOLVING SEMICONDUCTORS AND WILL PROBABLY BE WORKING ON NANOTECH FOR MY THESIS

I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO GO STRAIGHT INTO WORK BUT I HAD SOME OTHER MOTIVES FOR GOING TO GRAD SCHOOL CONTINENT CHANGE DON'T REGRET IT BUT STILL CAN'T WAIT TO HAVE A REAL WITH REAL MONEY AND NO HOMEWORK EXAMS

NO INTENTION OF DOING A PHD BUT WE SHALL SEE HOW LIFE GOES
I GOT MY B SOUTH IN PHYSICS AND THEN WENT STRAIGHT INTO A COMBINED MASTER'S PHD PROGRAM UNFORTUNATELY I WAS SO BURNT OUT WITH SCHOOLWORK THAT I LEFT AFTER A DISASTROUS FIRST YEAR AND JOINED THE WORKFORCE

I'M NOW A PROCESS ENGINEER AT A DECENT SIZED COMPANY MAKING BELOW AVERAGE PAY AND WITH PEERS WHO MOSTLY HAVE NO FORMAL EDUCATION AND FRANKLY I'M SICK OF DEALING WITH THE DAILY HORSESHIT

SO YEAH I REALLY REGRET DROPPING OUT OF GRAD SCHOOL
I THINK IT IS A HORRIBLE IDEA BUT I DON'T REGRET IT
I DECIDED NOT TO GO TO GRAD SCHOOL BECAUSE I THOUGHT I HAD A JOB DIRECTLY UTILIZING MY MAJORS LINED UP WELL THE JOB FELL THROUGH NOW I WORK AT A CALL CENTER WITH MISCREANTS I REGRET A LOT OF THINGS
I REGRET TAKING MY MASTERS THE MARKED WAS PRIMED AND LOOKING FOR PEOPLE BUT I WAS STUPID AND CHOSE TO STAY IN SCHOOL WHEN I WAS FINALLY DONE THE MARKED WAS BAD AND IS STILL BAD
I'M LOOKING FOR WORK WAITING TO START MY LIFE I ENDURE LEARNING MORE HONING MY SKILLS

MY BEST FRIEND HE WAS SMART GOT A JOB STRAIGHT AFTER HIS BACHELOR'S NOW HE WAS A WIFE AND A HOME WITH A KICK ASS JOB

I DON'T REGRET THE KNOWLEDGE I HAVE GAINED BUT IT SUCKS NOT HAVING A JOB AN INCOME THAT CAN REALIZE ONES DREAMS

I HAVE A BITTER SWEET FEEL FOR MY MASTERS

I DID HAVE MUCH FUN DURING MY MASTERS BUT THERE WERE MORE TIMES WHERE I WANTED TO QUIT BECOME A STRIPPER BECOME AN MALE ESCORT

MY RAMBLINGS
FINISHING A PHD IN COMPUTATIONAL THEORY AND TRANSITIONING TO JOBS IN DATA SCIENCE I DO NOT REGRET GETTING A GRADUATE DEGREE AS I WAS ABLE TO TRAVEL THE WORLD AND CONTRIBUTE TO SOME REWARDING RESEARCH IT ALSO IS A RELATIVELY ACCEPTED PATH TO GAIN CREDENTIALS IN DATA SCIENCE WHICH PAYS WELL AND IS IN HIGH DEMAND
WHAT YOU WILL USUALLY HEAR IS BACKWARDS RATIONALIZING

PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO ADMIT THEIR MISTAKES THEREFORE THEY WILL THROW OUT ARGUMENTS THAT COME FROM CONFIRMATION BIAS

MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND AND THINK FOR YOURSELF ASK YOURSELF WHY DO YOU ASK THE QUESTION AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT YOUR LIFE

BEST WISHES
I'M I TEACH MATHEMATICS I HAVE UNFINISHED BA IN PHYSICS WHICH I REALLY PLAN TO CONTINUE EVENTUALLY WORKING UP TO PHD IF EVERYTHING GOES GREAT
GRAD SCHOOL IS GOOD UP TO A POINT MASTERS IS GOOD PHD IS MOSTLY BAD

I HAVE THREE MASTERS AND MY WIFE HAS A PHD SHE THINKS IT WAS A WASTE
IM CURRENTLY DOING MY MASTERS STARTED ABOUT WEEKS AGO AND IMMEDIATELY KNEW IT WAS EVERYTHING I WANTED AFTER SPENDING TWO YEARS TRYING TO GET A JOB I WANTED TO STAY IN THEN AGAIN I KNEW THIS WAS WHAT I WANTED TO DO SINCE I GOT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL BECAUSE THE RESEARCH FORMAT SUITS ME MUCH BETTER

EDIT SPELLING CAUSE IM DRINKING RIGHT NOW
SECOND YEAR PHD STUDENT HERE

I DON'T REGRET IT IT'S A LOT OF FUN TO WORK ON RESEARCH PROJECTS THAT PUSH THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT'S CURRENTLY BEING DONE PERSONALLY I FIND THOSE ENTIRE RESEARCH PROCESS VERY FULFILLING CLASSES CAN BE A DRAG IT'S KIND OF WEIRD WHEN YOUR FRIENDS ARE STARTING THEIR LIVES AND YOU'RE STILL UP A FINISHING A PROBLEM SET BUT IT'S TYPICALLY ONLY YEARS OF CLASSES SO IT'S NOT THAT BAD BASICALLY YOU GET TO DO SOME COOL RESEARCH FOR A FEW YEARS WHILE LEARNING A LOT AND MAKING A PERFECTLY DECENT SALARY AND HOPEFULLY PICKING UP SOME MARKETABLE SKILLS

BUT IT'S EASY TO SEE WHY SOMEONE COULD REGRET IT MANY RESEARCH PROJECTS COULD BE VERY UNFULFILLING DUE TO THINGS LIKE POOR ADVISING UNCLEAR RESEARCH DIRECTION ESPECIALLY EARLY ON LONG-TERM PROJECTS WHERE EVEN MINOR MILESTONES COULD TAKE LONG PERIODS OF TIME WHICH COULD MAKE SOME FEEL THEY AREN'T REALLY ACCOMPLISHING ANYTHING OR EVOLVING RESEARCH INTERESTS

IN PURELY FINANCIAL TERMS A PHD IS LIKELY NOT WORTHWHILE BUT FOR A PHYSICS BS IT'S PROBABLY VERY MUCH WORTH IT TO GET A MASTERS AS LONG AS IT'S IN SOMETHING THAT'S NOT PHYSICS
DEFENDED MY PHD THESIS LAST JUNE FINALLY GOT MY DEGREE CONFERRED IN MAY BEEN SEARCHING LIKE HELL SINCE ABOUT JANUARY FOR A JOB I HAVEN'T FOUND ANYTHING PART OF THIS MAY BE DUE TO THE FACT THAT I DIDN'T HAVE A SINGLE EQUATION IN MY THESIS DID TISSUE ENGINEERING RESEARCH BUT I'VE APPLIED TO SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS AND IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM LIKE ANYONE WANTS TO HIRE ME FOR ANYTHING I'VE EVEN APPLIED TO MANY JOBS WITH JUST A BS REQUIREMENT NO CALLBACK NO INTERVIEWS FOR PRIVATE SECTOR POSITIONS I HAD ONE INTERVIEW FOR A POSTHOC POSITION BUT I DIDN'T HEAR BACK FROM THEM I'VE DONE A LOT OF NETWORKING IN MY AREA STREET LOUIS AND I'M JUST EXHAUSTED FROM SEARCHING

FROM MY EXPERIENCE GRAD SCHOOL WAS MISERABLE I WOULD RECOMMEND HAVING SOME PART OF YOUR LIFE FIGURED OUT FIRST EITHER A DREAM JOB OR HAVING A STABLE RELATIONSHIP FOR SUPPORT BECAUSE YOU NEED TO DIG A SHIPLOAD OF MOTIVATION IN ORDER TO FINISH IN THE FIRST PLACE

DONT DO UNLESS YOURE SURE
I LEFT AFTER 2 YEARS WITH MY MASTERS BUT I DON'T REGRET IT AT ALL I WAS A PHD STUDENT IN THE US WORKING AT CERN ON ATLAS HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE AND I FOUND THAT I ENJOYED WHAT I DID MUCH MORE THAN THE ACTUAL PHYSICS

I VERY MUCH ENJOYED MY TIME AS A PHD STUDENT AND I GOT TO WORK ON SOME REALLY COOL PROJECTS BUT I WAS GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE I NEEDED TO DO REAL PHYSICS AND I JUST WANTED TO DO HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE NOW I HAVE A REAL JOB THAT I ENJOY WHERE I CAN HONE MY SOFTWARE SKILLS

ONE THING I LEARNED IS THAT WRITING TERRIBLE CODE ISN'T ONLY DONE BY PHYSICISTS
NO I LOVE PHYSICS AND CONSIDER LEARNING AFT TO BE ONE OF MY PROUDEST ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN LIFE IT WAS UTTERLY USELESS FOR MY CAREER AND LIFE BUT COMPLETELY WORTH IT FOR AND SATISFACTION

ALTHOUGH NOT COMPLETELY USELESS AS I'M NOW A SOFTWARE ENGINEER AND WHEN PEOPLE ASK WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND AND I SAY THEORETICAL PHYSICIST THEY TEND TO ASSUME I'M A CERTIFIED GENIUS AND ASK QUESTIONS LATER SO I AM AT A HUGE ADVANTAGE COMPARED TO EVERYBODY ELSE WHO STUDIED A MORE COMMON FIELD

ALSO YOU REALLY LEARN HOW TO LEARN YOU REALIZE THAT YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY NEVER RELY ON MEMORIZING THINGS YOU HAVE TO BUILD YOUR UNDERSTANDING UP FROM THE GROUND MOST OTHER ACADEMIC DISCIPLINES GET BY BY MEMORIZING FACTS AND REGURGITATING THEM SO I NOTICE A LOT OF PROGRAMMERS SIMPLY LIKE TO REMEMBER HOW TO CALL A FRAMEWORK AND DON'T EXACTLY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON MY OBSESSION OVER THE YEARS OF TEARING DOWN PHYSICAL CONCEPTS AND UNDERSTANDING EVERY INCH OF THE PROCESS HAS PROVED TO BE VITAL TO MY CAREER
DO THEY HAVE BETTER SOLUTIONS THAN USING TAPE

EDIT ONE WAY EXPANDED GRAPHITE CAN BE MADE BY INTERCALATION I EAST PUTTING IT IN STRONG ACID AND HAVING IONS GO IN THE LATTICE THEN YOU DRY IT AND HEAT IT QUICKLY GRAPHITE ABSORBS MICROWAVES WELL AS I UNDERSTAND IT THE IONS WANT OUT AND TEAR THE LAYERS APART BASICALLY IT IS HAPHAZARDLY MULTIPLE LAYERS OF GRAPHEME AND OCCASIONALLY ONE LAYER ADAMIK NOT USEFUL FOR REALLY WANT ONE LAYER

SO I WONDER IF OTHER MATERIALS HAVE THAT BUT I KINAH SUSPECT YOU ALWAYS NEED NASTY STRONG STUFF AND IN THE HEATING THAT COMES OUT TOO
ISN'T THIS MORE CHEMISTRY THAN PHYSICS I UNDERSTAND THE BAND GAP CREATED FROM THE DISTANCE OF THE HOMO AND HUMO OF THE MATERIALS IS PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY
DELETED
YOU CAN ALWAYS APPLY TO THE PERIMETER SCHOLARS INTERNATIONAL IN CANADA IT IS A FUNDED MSC PROGRAM IN WATERLOO CANADA AND THEY DO RESEARCH IN AREAS THAT MIGHT INTEREST YOU THE SELECTION IS VERY COMPETITIVE BUT THE APPLICATION IS FREE
HAS ANYONE READ ANY DELIGHTFUL PAPERS LATELY THAT THEY'D LIKE TO SHARE

I ENJOYED THIS ONE FREE VERSION HERE
ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR ATOMIC PHYSICS BOOKS
I KNOW THIS ISN'T EXACTLY PHYSICS BUT I'M HAVING TROUBLE GETTING THROUGH INTRODUCTORY QUANTUM MECHANICS BY ROJANSKY BECAUSE OF MY LACK OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS KNOWLEDGE ANY ONE RECOMMEND A GOOD DE BOOK
HANDS DOWN THE BEST LECTURES ON GENERAL PHYSICS COME FROM DR WALTER LEWIN THE LECTURES WERE PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE VIA MIT OPEN COURSEWARE I DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO GET INTO A DISCUSSION ABOUT LEWIN AS A PERSON BUT HIS LECTURES STILL STAND AS AN AMAZINGLY INTUITIVE PRESENTATION OF PHYSICS CONCEPTS

THEY'RE AVAILABLE ON YOUTUBE



THE CLIFFNOTES OF EQUATIONS

FOR BOTH GENERAL E M USUALLY SECOND SEMESTER OF GENERAL PHYSICS AND DEDICATED E M AND 2 THIS IS AN EXCELLENT POCKET REFERENCE IT BREAKS DOWN EACH OF EQUATIONS AS WELL AS SOME OF THE RELATED EQUATIONS LIKE THE LAW AND EQUATION

THE BREAKDOWN LOOKS LIKE THIS HTTPS EACH OF THE ARROWS GETS ITS OWN PAGE DESCRIBING WHAT THE OPERATION OR VALUE MEANS THE WHOLE BOOK IS ABOUT PAGES BUT IT'S PRETTY THOROUGH AND REALLY EASY TO READ

I WILL NEVER NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO PEOPLE



I'M ALMOST DONE WITH MY ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING DEGREE I TOOK A PHYSICS MINOR AS WELL SO I GOT TO SEE PHYSICS TAUGHT IN A FEW DIFFERENT WAYS
HERE ARE SOME OF THE TEXTBOOKS I USED

UNIVERSITY PHYSICS WITH MODERN PHYSICS USED FOR GENERAL PHYSICS

ONE OF THE BEST TEXTBOOKS MAYBE THE BEST I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF USING IT HAS VERY INTUITIVE PRESENTATION OF CONCEPTS AND A REALLY NICE LAYOUT IT ALSO HAS MINIMAL FLUFF AND A PERFECT DIAGRAM RATIO IT WORKS SO WELL WITH THE LEWIN LECTURES THAT I'M WONDERING IF THIS IS THE BOOK MIT USED

EITHER WAY IT'S A FUCKING AMAZING TEXT I BOUGHT THE LOOSE-LEAF VERSION FOR BETTER PORTABILITY AND OBTAINED THE PDF I DON'T FEEL BAD AT ALL ABOUT MY PURCHASE EVEN THOUGH I HAD ACCESS TO THE BOOK ANYWAY

MODERN PHYSICS USED FOR MODERN PHYSICS AND 2

THIS WAS ANOTHER GOOD BOOK I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS AS INTUITIVE AS THE GENERAL PHYSICS TEXT BUT MOST OF THE CONTENT IS FAR LESS INTUITIVE ANYWAY I HAVE NO MAJOR COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS TEXT THE LAYOUT WAS ALSO NOT QUITE AS NICE AS THE SUPERB GENERAL PHYSICS TEXT ABOVE

INTRODUCTION TO ELECTROMECHANICS USED FOR E M AND 2

AGAIN THE LAYOUT ISN'T QUITE AS NICE AS THE GENERAL PHYSICS BOOK THE BOOK SEEMS SOLID AND MY COMPLAINTS ARE MINOR AND RARE ENOUGH THAT I DON'T REMEMBER MOST OF THEM THE BOOK STARTS WITH A VECTOR CALCULUS REFRESHER WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE THE NOTATION ISN'T EXACTLY THE SAME AS MY STEWART TEXT ONCE AGAIN NO MAJOR COMPLAINTS

FUNDAMENTALS OF APPLIED ELECTROMAGNETICS USED FOR MY EE ELECTROMAGNETICS COURSE

REMEMBER WHEN I SAID THE GENERAL PHYSICS TEXT HAD A GOOD DIAGRAM RATIO THE IDEA FOR THAT RATIO CAME FROM THIS BOOK IT'S SERIOUSLY PACKED WITH EQUATIONS AND DIAGRAMS WITHOUT MORE THAN A SMALL BLURB BETWEEN THEM THAT MAKES THE TEXT DENSE AS FUCK NOT ONLY THAT BUT THE BOOK IS IN FULL COLOR AND THOSE COLORS ARE SERIOUSLY OVERUSED EVERYTHING IS HIGHLIGHTED OR WRITTEN IN A DIFFERENT COLOR IT MAKES THE BOOK HARDER TO READ BECAUSE IT'S CONFUSING TO THE EYE

IT'S A GOOD REFERENCE BECAUSE IT'S GENERALLY PRETTY CONCISE BUT IT'S A LITTLE ANNOYING TO USE

IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED I CAN TALK ABOUT MY SOLID STATE CIRCUITS COMMUNICATIONS SIGNALS SYSTEMS ELECTROMECHANICS ETC TEXTBOOKS THOSE ARE EE RATHER THAN PHYSICS THOUGH

I NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO USE THESE BUT SOME OF THE PHYSICS STUDENTS WOULDN'T SHUT UP ABOUT THEM

THE FEYNMAN LECTURES ON PHYSICS

A FEW OF LECTURES ARE ALSO AVAILABLE ONLINE

I LOVE STYLE OF EXPLANATION I REALLY DO IT FLOWS FROM ONE THOUGHT TO ANOTHER IN A VERY FLUID AND BEAUTIFULLY VISUAL WAY THE REASON I DON'T RATE THEM HIGHER THAN LECTURES IS BECAUSE IT'S A BIT HARDER TO APPLY THE EXPLANATIONS IN A PRACTICAL SENSE AS IN HOW TO APPROACH A PARTICULAR PROBLEM IN THE BOOK

STILL WORTH A WATCH IMO BUT IF YOU NEED HELP WITH PHYSICS LEWIN IS A MORE DIRECT PATH AND HAS WAY MORE CONTENT AVAILABLE
I'M DOING AN INDEPENDENT STUDY NEXT SEMESTER TO FINISH MY ASTRONOMY MINOR AND WANT TO DO A COURSE ON COMPUTATIONAL ASTROPHYSICS

I'M LOOKING TO DO A PROJECT EVERY WEEK AND WANT AN ADVANCED UNDERGRAD TEXTBOOK THAT CAN HELP ME SET UP AND UNDERSTAND PROJECTS TO DO
ANY GOOD RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BOOKS ON SPECIAL RELATIVITY CURRENTLY A FRESHMEN ASTRO PHYSICS MAJOR LOOKING FOR A GOOD READ TO HELP ME GET A BASIS OF IDEAS TO COME
I'M LOOKING FOR AN ADVANCED BUT INTUITIVE TREATMENT OF QUANTUM OPTICS IF SUCH A THING EXISTS PREFERABLY WITH AN EMPHASIS ON THE UNDERLYING HILBERT ALGEBRA AS THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE NEVER HAD A FORMAL DISCUSSION OF
I'M IN THE US I GOT A JOB AS AN AEROSPACE ENGINEER
MY SUPERVISOR WAS ALSO A PHYSICS MAJOR AND HE GOT A JOB AS AN AEROSPACE ENGINEER TOO
IT WILL DEPEND MOSTLY WHERE YOU INTERN AND WHO YOU MEET AS AN UNDERGRAD SOME COMPANIES ARE WILLING TO TRAIN AS LONG AS YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE IN ANYTHING STEM RELATED
MAKE AN EFFORT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE FIELD YOU'RE INTERESTED IN AS WELL
I REALLY WANTED TO DO AEROSPACE SO I LEARNED 3D MODELING AND DRAFTING SKILLS ON MY OWN BEFORE THE INTERVIEWS
THATS THE KIND OF STUFF THAT WILL MAKE YOU ATTRACTIVE AS A FRESH GRADUATE
YOU DON'T NEED A PHD TO GET A JOB BUT YOU NEED IT IF YOU WANT TO DO PHYSICS RESEARCH OF THE TIME
POSSIBLY IT'S BECAUSE IN THE US A PHYSICS GRADUATE WOULD HAVE A BACHELORS WHILE IN THE UK THEY WOULD USUALLY HAVE AN MPHPS

ALTERNATIVELY THEY MAY HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT A JOB DOING PHYSICS I EAST DOING RESEARCH WHICH YOU WOULD NEED A GRADUATE DEGREE FOR
I HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN PHYSICS AND HAD NO TROUBLE GETTING JOB INTERVIEWS I ENDED UP AN ENGINEER AND ONE OF THE SENIOR ENGINEERS ALSO ONLY HAS AN UNDERGRAD IN PHYSICS

IT DEPENDS ON THE FIELD YOU WANT TO GET INTO

SILICON VALLEY SEEMS TO HAVE LOTS OF JOBS FOR PHYSICS GRADS SPECIFICALLY IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY
I BELIEVE THIS MIGHT AID YOUR QUEST FOR KNOWLEDGE
SCIENCE BIOLOGY V
THIS IS JUST KIND OF BAD ACTUALLY

I DON'T KNOW HOW AN IDIOSYNCRATIC ALTERNATIVE CONCEPTUAL RATIONALE THAT I'M NOT ACTUALLY CONVINCED IS EVEN CORRECT FOR ANYON EXCHANGE PHASES DEMYSTIFIES THE CONCEPT IF ANYTHING IT BECOMES MUCH MORE MYSTERIOUS IF ANYON STATISTICS ISN'T A CONSEQUENCE OF SPATIAL DIMENSION BUT OF AN ASYMMETRIC POTENTIAL THAT DISTINGUISHES OTHERWISE INDISTINGUISHABLE PARTICLES WHY AREN'T THERE ANIONS IN DIMENSIONS

EDIT TO ANYONE HOPING TO HAVE ANIONS ACTUALLY DEMYSTIFIED LECTURE NOTES GIVE A VERY NICE OVERVIEW
AS I UNDERSTAND IT THIS EXPLANATION ISN'T REALLY RIGHT IF YOU LOOK AT WAVE FUNCTION FOR EXAMPLE EXCHANGING THE COORDINATES OF TWO QUASIPARTICLE DOESN'T CHANGE THE WAVE FUNCTION THEY LOOK LIKE BOSONS THE ANIONIC PHASE IS THE BERRY PHASE YOU GET FROM ADIABATICALLY BRAIDING THEM AROUND EACH OTHER
IF THE NUMBER YOU WANT TO SHOW IS IT'LL BE EASY
SURE JUST FOLLOW THIS TUTORIAL PUTTING THE LEFT HALF OF THE NUMBER ON ONE SIDE AND THE RIGHT HALF ON THE OTHER
DEPENDS ON THE AXIS OF ROTATION THE SIMPLEST CASE IS IF YOU ROTATE AROUND THE DISC'S NORMAL VECTOR THROUGH THE CENTER THEN YOU WOULD ONLY GET CIRCLES UNLESS LIGHTS ON THE DISC ARE TURNED ON AND OFFICIAL
DRAW HAS IS LIMITATIONS WHAT ABOUT MAKING IT LIKE A PUNCH CARD WITH MULTIPLE DISKS OVERLAPPING WITH PROPER TIMING STOPPED IT WOULD BE PAPER WHEELS WITH RANDOM HOLES SPINNING IN THE PROPER SYNC WITH A BACKLIGHT I IMAGINE YOU COULD ACCOMPLISH MORE IT IS BREAKING BENDING THE STIPULATIONS GIVEN THOUGH
YOU MEAN SOMETHING LIKE THIS A STRING OF LEDS IS SPUN AND SOME ARE TURNED ON AND OFF FOR DIFFERENT TIME PERIODS TO CREATE THE ILLUSION OF LETTERS OR PATTERNS

ID
IF YOU MEAN SPINNING LIKE A DISC IN AN OPTICAL DRIVE WOULD YOU WOULDN'T ACHIEVE ANY NUMBER THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANGULAR SYMMETRY TO GET THE EFFECT I ASSUME YOU WILL NEED TO HAVE A VIDEO CAMERA WITH A SAMPLE RATE AND FAST SHUTTER SPEED AS OUR EYES BLUR THE IMAGE WHILE THE DRAWING IS IN MOTION BUT A CAMERA TAKES SNAPSHOTS
WHO ENDS UP USING THE RESULTS OF THIS RESEARCH IT SEEMS LIKE THE PEOPLE IN INDUSTRY WOULD KNOW WAY MORE ABOUT THEIR OWN PRODUCTS THAN THE RESEARCHERS
I'M IN THE INDUSTRY LONG STORY SHORT THERE'S A SUBSTANTIAL OVERSUPPLY OF SOLAR PANELS DUE TO VARYING FACTORS THE EXTENSION OF THE US SOLAR ITC WHICH REMOVED THE URGENCY OF PROJECTS BEING COMPLETED BY THE END OF 2 CHINA DRASTICALLY REDUCED THEIR DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION INITIATIVES IN JULY OF THIS YEAR SUNEDISON THE LARGEST SOLAR DEVELOPER IN THE WORLD FILED FOR CHAPTER IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR PUSHING OUT OR CANCELLING MULTIPLE PROJECTS THIS LED TO THE OVERSUPPLY AS PANEL MANUFACTURERS WERE GEARING UP TO FULFILL BOTH CHINESE AND US PROJECTS BY THE END OF CHINESE SUPPLIERS ARE NOW DUMPING PANELS INTO THE US AND ELSEWHERE IN ORDER TO CLEAR THEIR INVENTORIES AND KEEP THEIR LINES RUNNING AND TRADITIONALLY IN SOLAR PRICING NEVER FLUCTUATES ONCE IT DROPS THE TENDENCY IS FOR PRICING TO KEEP DROPPING I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEEN MORE PANEL MANUFACTURERS TO DECLARE BANKRUPTCY IN THE NEAR FUTURE AS MOST ARE SHOWING SIGNIFICANT LOSSES
SOLAR ROADWAYS COULD USE THIS


TRIGGERED
JUST USE LTSPICE IT'S FREE HAS A DECENT PARTS LIBRARY AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY SIMULATE AS WELL
I WOULD USE A GREASE PENCIL OR WET ERASE MARKER TO DRAW ON WINDOWS BE IT CIRCUITS OR ANYTHING ELSE
CAN'T RECOMMEND CICAD ENOUGH FOR THIS STUFF I'VE USED IT SINCE SECONDARY SCHOOL FOR DRAWING ELECTRICAL SCHEMATICS
DEPENDS ON WHAT SORT OF CIRCUITS YOU'RE INTERESTED IN

I USE THE EESCHEMA SCHEMATIC PACKAGE FROM CICAD FOR COMPLEX ELECTRONIC SCHEMATICS

IT'S OPEN SOURCE AND SEEMS PRETTY GOOD IT INTEGRATES WITH A DESIGN PACKAGE BUT I HAVEN'T TRIED THAT
IMHO SPICE IS UGLY I USE FRIEZING IT'S KINDA HEAVY HAS A LOT OF FEATURES BEYOND JUST SKETCHING CIRCUIT SCHEMATICS BUT IT'S PRETTY AND MORE USER FRIENDLY THAN MOST OTHER STUFF I'VE SEEN
I USE THIS WEBSITE WHEN I HAVE TO MAKE CIRCUIT DIAGRAMS FOR QUIZ EXAM PROBLEMS
SCHEMIST

TRY CIRCUITMAKER
CADSOFT HTTPS HAS A FREE VERSION OF THEIR EAGLE CAD THE FREE VERSION IS GOOD FOR SMALL PROJECTS THEY LIMIT THE SCHEMATIC SHEETS TO TWO AND THE BOARD LAYOUT TO TWO LAYERS THERE'S ALSO AN EDUCATIONAL VERSION THAT ISN'T LIMITED
A WHILE BACK I DID AN EXPERIMENT TO SEE THE GLOW OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS AS A PLASMA SEE ATTACHED GIF

AS EXPECTED YOU GET THE POSITIVE GLOWING COLUMN CONSISTING OF GLOWING DISKS

BUT WHEN USING WATER YOU DON'T GET THIS DISKS YOU GET THIS WEIRD FINE MUSHROOM LIKE STRUCTURE

I'M CURIOUS CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN WHAT IS GOING ON AND WHAT CAUSES THIS

MY BEST GUESS WOULD BE IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE MORE ENERGY STATS IN WATER IN CONTRAST TO EAST G ARGON AND OR THE HIGH STABILITY OF THE GENERATED IONS

I WONDER HOW REALISTIC IS IT TO TEACH MYSELF PHYSICS

SOMEWHAT REALISTIC

TO THE POINT THAT I CAN START TO PUBLISH SERIOUS PAPERS AND TO WORK WITH OTHER PHYSICISTS ON CUTTING EDGE ISSUES

VERY UNREALISTIC

HAVE YOU SEEN ANYONE WHO TAUGHT THEMSELVES PHYSICS AND EVENTUALLY BECAME A PHYSICIST

NO ALTHOUGH I KNOW PEOPLE WHO WITH A BACKGROUND IN PHYSICS HAVE PUBLISHED SMALLER PAPERS BASED ON INDEPENDENT WORK

I ONLY HAVE A MASTER DEGREE IN ENGINEERING IS THERE A WAY FOR ME TO APPLY FOR PHD IN A UNIVERSITY

YES THIS IS QUITE POSSIBLE WHAT KIND OF ENGINEERING
NOT VERY REALISTIC IN THE END DOING RESEARCH AND PUBLISHING IS A JOB THAT REQUIRES CERTAIN QUALIFICATION AND HAVING A DEGREE IS YOUR WAY TO PROVE YOU HAVE IT

JUST CONSIDER IF YOU WERE TO ASK THIS QUESTION ABOUT A DIFFERENT PROFESSION WOULD YOU LET A SELF-TAUGHT SURGEON OPERATE ON YOU WOULD YOU FLY A PLANE MADE BY A SELF-TAUGHT ENGINEER
I HAVE A BACHELOR'S IN PHYSICS AND HAVE BEEN WORKING IN THE SOFTWARE FIELD FOR ABOUT 2 YEARS NOW I STARTED DOWN THIS ROAD ABOUT YEAR AGO THE THING ABOUT AFT AND GR IS THE AMOUNT OF MATH REQUIRED I WENT THROUGH CALCULUS ON MANIFOLDS IN COLLEGE AS A PART OF A SUPPLEMENT FOR ANALYSIS REALLY ANY ANALYSIS COVERING EUCLIDEAN DIFFERENTIATION AND INTEGRATION STOKES AND DIVERGENCE SHOULD BE FINE WHEN I STARTED I STARTED WITH TENSOR ANALYSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL FORMS THIS ALSO COVERED CALCULUS OF VARIATIONS THEN TO REALLY UNDERSTAND AFT YOU NEED TO GO THROUGH MECHANICS AT A GRADUATE LEVEL WHICH MEANS CLASSICAL MECHANICS AND ELECTRODYNAMICS I'M ASSUMING YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH ELECTRODYNAMICS I'M STILL WORKING ON THIS PROBABLY GOING TO START AFT AFTER THIS IF YOU HAVE ENGINEERING QM YOU'LL HAVE TO GO THROUGH SHANKAR THERE IS NO WAY AROUND IT ALL OF THE BOOKS MENTIONED ARE BUILT FOR SELF-STUDY IT'S VERY REALISTIC TO TEACH YOURSELF THE PHYSICS BUT THEN WORKING IN THE FIELD AND PUBLISHING PAPERS REQUIRE COMMUNAL AND TRIBAL KNOWLEDGE WHICH CAN ONLY BE GAINED THROUGH PEERS AND READING PAPERS SO I'M NOT SURE THIS IS REALISTIC TO DO WORKING A HOUR A WEEK JOB ALSO NOT SURE IT'S WORTH IT TO GO DEEPER THAN THIS
THIS IS REALLY USEFUL THANKS
IF YOUTUBE IS TO BE BELIEVED YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO STUDY JUST STRING A BUNCH OF SCIENCE WORDS TOGETHER AND SPOUT OFF YOUR THEORIES IN A CONFIDENT TONE SORRY BUT IT HAS TO BE SAID THERE ARE SO MANY CRACKPOTS OUT THERE
FOR THE FIRST TIME

YEAH NOT SO MUCH
BETWEEN SINGLE ATOMS

VAN DER WAALS FORCES IN GENERAL ARE TRIVIAL TO MEASURE
HOLY SHIT THAT IS AMAZING I'M SURPRISED THE LJ CURVES MATCH SO WELL SURE THEY'RE DIFFERENT BUT GIVEN THE NOISE OF THE DATA AND THE OTHER APPROXIMATIONS MADE IN MD IT SEEMS THAT THE FUNCTIONAL FORM OF THE PAIR POTENTIAL IS ONE OF THE SMALLEST FACTORS OF MISMATCH THAT MAKES ME PRETTY HAPPY

IF THEY GOT DATA FOR OR THEY COULD INVESTIGATE THE VALIDITY OF ALL THE VARIOUS MIXING RULES USED IN SIMULATION WHICH WOULD BE SUPER INTERESTING TO ME
I CAN'T SPEAK FOR EVERYONE BUT IN MY SENIOR YEAR OF MY UNDERGRAD MOST OF OUR SENIORS ARE GOING FOR ENGINEERING OUT OF OUR SENIORS ONE IS GOING TO GRAD SCHOOL FOR PHYSICS FOR THE MOST PART IT SEEMS AS THOUGH A GRAD DEGREE IS NEEDED FOR A PHYSICS CAREER

THE WORKLOAD IS PROBABLY MORE THAN OTHER MAJORS AT LEAST FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN THERE ARE A LOT OF REQUIRED CLASSES TO TAKE FROM ALL OF THE MATH CHEM AND THEN PHYSICS MY AVERAGE AMOUNT OF CREDITS PER SEMESTER HAS BEEN AND THAT SEEMS TO BE THE NORM IT'S DEFINITELY DOABLE THOUGH
I'M A 3RD YEAR MAJOR IN ASTROPHYSICS AND APPLIED MATH WITH A COMP SCI MINOR MY ROOMMATE IS A MECHANICAL ENGINEERING MAJOR

I'M NOT SURE ABOUT JOBS YET BUT WITH EXPERIENCE WITH MATH AND OR COMPUTER SCIENCE ALONG WITH THE PHYSICS MAKES IT MUCH EASIER TO FIND AVAILABLE INTERNSHIPS RESEARCH ETC DURING THE UNDERGRAD MY ROOMMATE HAS HAD VERY NICE INTERNSHIPS AS WELL AND THE DEMAND FOR ENGINEERING IS HIGH THE UPSIDE TO ENGINEERING IS THAT YOU GET EXPERIENCE IN ALL THREE FIELDS MATH COMPANY SCI PHYSICS WITHOUT HAVING TO HAVE MULTIPLE MAJORS FOR PHYSICS YOU TAKE A LOT OF MATH CLASSES BUT YOU MAY NOT HAVE AS MUCH EXPERIENCE IN COMP SCI IF YOU DON'T LEARN ON YOUR OWN OR DO RESEARCH NOTE ALL RESEARCH YOU WILL DO INVOLVES PROGRAMMING I CAN ALMOST GUARANTEE IT

EITHER WAY THE SKILLS YOU DEVELOP SHOULD BE APPLICABLE TO FINDING A JOB DON'T TAKE THIS AS FACT BUT I WOULD IMAGINE THAT ENGINEERING IS A LITTLE MORE MARKETABLE SINCE IT IS A VERY PRACTICAL SKILL COMPARED TO PHYSICS WHICH IS MORE THEORETICAL

2 IT'S A LOT OF WORK FOR BOTH OF THEM AGAIN I'M SPEAKING FOR UNDERGRAD ALTHOUGH I CAN'T IMAGINE GRAD SCHOOL WILL BE ANY LESS WORK HAHA I ASKED MY ROOMMATE AND HE SAID THAT A LOT OF THE CLASSES HE TAKES DON'T REALLY SEEM LIKE WORK BUT MORE LIKE A REALLY ENGAGING SET OF PROBLEMS YOU HAVE TO WORK ON I AGREE COMPLETELY WITH PHYSICS

COMPARED TO OTHER MAJORS THOUGH IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME TO SAY I CAN SAY FOR SURE THAT PHYSICS AND MATH ARE SOME OF THE HARDEST AROUND JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE HARD SCIENCES I HAVE FRIENDS WHO HAVE A LOT OF WORK AS ENGLISH MAJORS AS WELL THOUGH WHILE THE CONTENT OF THE PHYSICS MAJOR IS MOST LIKELY MORE DIFFICULT BY NATURE IT'S HARD TO SAY THE WORK LOAD IS LARGER IT DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF PERSON YOU ARE I IMAGINE


SORRY FOR THE WALL OF TEXT BUT I HOPE IT HELPS OUT SOME IF YOU LIKE PHYSICS BOTH MAJORS ARE GOING TO BE ENGAGING FOR YOU IF YOU PREFER A MORE PRACTICAL PHYSICS BUILDING COOL THINGS INVENTING ENGINEERING MAY BE A BETTER CHOICE FOR EXAMPLE MY ROOMMATE AND I ARE BUILDING A RADIO TELESCOPE FOR A PROJECT HE IS DESIGNING THE WHOLE THING BUT I AM HELPING OUT WITH SOME OF THE CALIBRATIONS MATH AND PROGRAMMING IF YOU WANT TO SOMETHING LIKE THAT PHYSICS OR ASTROPHYSICS MAY BE MORE YOUR STYLE GOOD LUCK AND I HOPE YOU ENJOY WHATEVER YOU CHOOSE
JUST REMEMBER TO MAKE ANYTHING OF THAT DEGREE YOU MUST SET YOUR SIGHTS ON A PHD WHICH THESE DAYS WILL PAY OFF HANDSOMELY

ALSO ALONG THE WAY YOU CAN BAIL OUT INTO ENGINEERING IF IT'S NOT A GOOD FIT

JUST MAKE SURE YOU LOVE ALL FORMS OF MATH BECAUSE LEARNING PHYSICS IS AS MUCH ABOUT THE MATH AS IT IS ABOUT THE PHYSICAL PROCESSES

I'D SAY THE WORKLOADS ARE COMPARABLE TO ENGINEERING MATH OR COMPUTER SCIENCE MAJORS

PHYSICS UNDERGRAD DEGREE ONLY HERE DON'T DO IT HUGE EFFORT NOT WORTH RETURN I CAN'T FIND A JOB TO SAVE MY LIFE EVERYONE'S IMPRESSED BUT YOU'RE OVERQUALIFIED FOR LESSER JOBS AND UNDER QUALIFIED FOR REGULAR JOBS FROM LACK OF RELATED WORK EXPERIENCE SO YOU CAN'T GET EXPERIENCE NEEDED GO ENGINEERING SERIOUSLY
CURRENT UNDERGRAD IN PHYSICS ASTROPHYSICS IN AUSTRALIA ANY RESEARCH JOBS IN PHYSICS WOULD DEFINITELY REQUIRE A PHD AND FROM WHAT I HAVE HEARD THOSE POSITIONS TEND TO BE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN SO ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE I HAVE ALSO HEARD THAT JOBS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE A PHD BUT INSTEAD ONLY REQUIRE A MASTERS ARE EVEN MORE COMPETITIVE DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE APPLYING

PHYSICS OTHER HARD SCIENCES DEFINITELY HAS A HIGHER CONSTANT WORKLOAD THAN MOST OTHER MAJORS OTHER MAJORS DO A FEW ESSAYS THROUGHOUT THE SEMESTER MAYBE A FEW OTHER KEY PIECES HERE AND THERE PHYSICS HAS WEEKLY ASSIGNMENTS AND LABS ON TOP OF THAT SO WE'RE NEVER WITHOUT WORK TO DO AND WE CAN'T JUST LEAVE IT FOR WEEKS UNTIL THE NIGHT BEFORE IF YOU MISS A FEW DAYS IT CAN BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO CATCH BACK UP
DIFFICULTY VARIES BASED ON YOUR SCHOOL AND THE EMPLOYERS PRESENT IN THE LOCAL ECONOMY PUT SOME SERIOUS EFFORT STARTING NOW INTO LEARNING HOW TO PROGRAM EITHER ON YOUR OWN OR THROUGH A CS MINOR DOUBLE MAJOR AND YOU'LL BE FINE IT'S WELL WORTH IT FOR HOW MUCH EASIER IT WILL MAKE PHYSICS RESEARCH SHOULD YOU GO THAT DIRECTION

2 EXTREMELY MUCH MORE BUT I GUARANTEE DUMBER PEOPLE THAN YOU HAVE MANAGED IT SO IF IT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO GO FOR IT
CAN YOU GIVE US A LOCATION US EUROPE AUSTRALIA BECAUSE THE ANSWER MIGHT VARY QUITE A BIT DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE
HI I MAJORED IN ENGINEERING PHYSICS BECAUSE I STRUGGLED WITH THIS EXACT SAME DECISION I VERY MUCH ENJOYED BOTH SETS OF CLASSES THOUGH I FELT MORE LIKE A PHYSICS MAJOR ALL THE TIME MY DEGREE WAS THROUGH THE PHYSICS DEPARTMENT AND OTHER PHYSICS MAJORS WERE THE PEOPLE I SPENT TIME WITH NOW I WORK AS AN ENGINEER IN THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY HAVE BEEN HERE FOR A BIT OVER YEARS AND I FEEL MY COMBINED BACKGROUND GAVE ME A UNIQUE AND STRONG STARTING POINT FOR ENTERING MY FIELD

I DIDN'T SPEND MUCH TIME LOOKING FOR PHYSICS JOBS BUT I FELT THAT GRAD SCHOOL WOULD HAVE BEEN NECESSARY TO ADVANCE IN THE FIELD IT'S HARD TO SAY WHAT THE MARKET WILL LOOK LIKE WHEN YOU GRADUATE BUT HAVING A SCIENCE ENGINEERING BACKGROUND WILL CERTAINLY GIVE YOU A GOOD STARTING POINT ONE THING I'M SURE YOU'LL HEAR LATER ON IS THAT A STRONG DIFFERENTIATOR BETWEEN CANDIDATES WHEN LOOKING BORN YOUR FIRST JOB IS YOUR WORK EXPERIENCE TRY TO WORK WITH PROFESSORS OR GO FOR INTERNSHIPS TO GET YOUR FOOT IN THE DOOR

2 THE WORKLOAD FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING WILL BE HIGHER THAN MANY OTHER MAJORS GOOGLE QUALITY OF LIFE ENGINEERING VS LIBERAL ARTS FOR A QUICK CHUCKLE JOKING ASIDE IF THESE ARE THE FIELDS YOU WANT TO WORK IN YOU'LL NEED TO GET ACCUSTOMED TO WORKING HARD AND THINKING HARD I DON'T THINK WORKLOAD BETWEEN PHYSICS AND ENGINEERING WAS MUCH DIFFERENT BUT MY PHYSICS CLASSES CERTAINLY DEMANDED A STRONGER MASTERY OF MATH CALCULUS

CHEERS AND PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS
I WENT TO A SCHOOL WITHOUT AN ENGINEERING PROGRAM WE DID HAVE A DUAL DEGREE PROGRAM WITH ANOTHER SCHOOL THAT WAS ON MY RADAR ALSO I WENT TO A LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGE SO A STATE SCHOOL MAY BE A DIFFERENT BEAST I DON'T KNOW
JOB PROSPECTS ARE GREAT WITH A PHYSICS DEGREE IF YOU HAVE SOME COMPUTER SCIENCE UNDER YOUR BELT IT ALSO DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU WANT TO DO DO YOU WANT TO DO ENGINEERING GET AN ENGINEERING DEGREE CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF THE COURSEWORK IS VERY VERY DIFFERENT ENGINEERING DEGREES AT MOST SCHOOLS ARE HIGHLY REGIMENTED WITH REQUIRED COURSES IN ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT PHYSICS MAJORS TAKE AS ELECTIVES IF THEY WANT TO IT TOOK COURSES TO GET THE BASIC VERSION OF THE PHYSICS MAJOR AT MY SCHOOL ENGINEERING SCHOOL CAN BE DOUBLE THAT OR MORE KEEP IN MIND ON A SEMESTER SYSTEM YOU ONLY TAKE COURSES OVER YEARS DO YOU WANT TO TAKE PHILOSOPHY AND SCULPTURE AND ANCIENT HISTORY GET A PHYSICS MAJOR OR GO SOMEWHERE LIKE TRINITY OR DARTMOUTH WHERE THE ENGINEERING DEGREE LEAVES SOME FREEDOM TO DO THAT

2 WORKLOAD IF YOU ARE CLEVER ABOUT COURSE ORDER IT'S NOT TOO BAD START FRESHMAN YEAR AND TAKE MATH CONCURRENTLY WITH THE INTRO SEMESTERS OF PHYSICS FOR US THE SOPHOMORE YEAR OF PHYSICS CENTURY STUFF WAS HELL BUT THE ELECTIVES WE TOOK JUNIOR AND SENIOR YEAR WERE ALL PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD EXCEPT FOR ONE I TOOK ON ADVANCED QUANTUM MECHANICS SENIOR FALL AS PART OF AN EXTENSION TO MY MAJOR THAT I DID THAT WAS ALSO HELL TAUGHT BY A MAN WHO SAID THERE WAS NO CRYING IN PHYSICS EVERY TIME SOMEONE COMPLAINED AND IN ANOTHER COURSE YELLED AT ME FOR SMILING IN CLASS HELL COURSES WERE HOURS OF WORK PER WEEK STRAIGHTFORWARD ONES WERE

PAGE SOUTH IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ENGINEERING CHECK OUR KETTERING AND THEIR CO-OP PROGRAM I WISH I HAD KNOWN ABOUT IT WHEN I WAS APPLYING TO COLLEGES
THE WORKLOAD OF A PHYSICS MAJOR AND MOST ENGINEERING MAJORS WILL BE FAIRLY COMPARABLE BOTH ARE AT THE HIGH END OF WHAT YOU EXPECT TO FIND AMONG ALL MAJORS

A PHYSICS DEGREE HAS TWO USES YOU CAN COMBINE IT WITH AN EDUCATION CERTIFICATION TO TEACH HIGH-SCHOOL PHYSICS OR YOU CAN USE IT TO GET INTO A GRADUATE PROGRAM AN ENGINEERING DEGREE HAS ONE USE YOU CAN GET A JOB AS AN ENGINEER

ONE OPTION THAT DOESN'T GET MENTIONED OFTEN IS THAT IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON GRAD SCHOOL ANYWAY AN UNDERGRADUATE PHYSICS DEGREE CAN LET YOU MOVE TO A GRADUATE ENGINEERING PROGRAM THE PHYSICS DEGREE WILL GIVE YOU A GREATER BREADTH OF KNOWLEDGE IF YOU ARE NOT YET SURE WHAT KIND OF ENGINEERING YOU WOULD WANT TO STUDY
GET A JOB WITH A PHYSICS BACHELORS ISN'T HARD GETTING A JOB DOING PHYSICS IS IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT A PHD MY CLASSMATES FROM UNDERGRAD THAT DIDN'T GO TO GRAD SCHOOL HAVE GOOD PAYING JOBS COMPARED TO THEIR PEERS DOING PROGRAMMING ENGINEERING OR FINANCIAL TYPE THINGS AND PHYSICS MAJORS TEND TO HAVE REALLY HIGH SCORES ON THE ASAT

UNDERGRAD WORK LOAD IS TOUGH BUT NOT THAT MUCH MORE THAN OTHER MAJORS I DID A DOUBLE MAJOR WITH MATH AND ACTIVELY TOOK AS MANY CLASSES AS POSSIBLE SO I ENDED UP DOING MORE THAN I HAD TO YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST BE GOOD AT MATHEMATICS SPECIFICALLY CALCULUS AND LINEAR ALGEBRA AND MAYBE A LITTLE GROUP THEORY AND ABSTRACT THOUGHT TO DO PHYSICS WHEREAS FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND FOR ENGINEERING IT HELPS TO BE GOOD AT MATH BUT I KNOW ENGINEERS WHO FAILED CALCULUS TWICE BUT STILL MANAGED TO GET THE DEGREE ENGINEERING IS ALSO A WORK INTENSIVE DEGREE BUT I THINK IT HAS MORE DESIGN OF REAL THINGS RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON PHYSICAL CONCEPTS SO ENGINEERS DON'T REALLY NEED TO KNOW THE PHYSICAL LAWS BEYOND HOW TO USE THEM TO DESIGN THINGS

IN GRADUATE SCHOOL FOR PHYSICS THE WORK LOAD IS VERY HARD A GRAD LEVEL CLASS CAN EASILY HAVE THE WORK LOAD OF THREE UNDERGRADUATE CLASSES AND I HAD NO FREE TIME AT ALL FOR MY FIRST TWO YEARS IT WASN'T UNCOMMON FOR ME TO WORK WELL OVER HOURS PER WEEK TEACHING TAKING CLASSES AND DOING RESEARCH I AM ON TO FULL TIME RESEARCH SO I STILL WORK A LOT BUT THERE ARE LESS ABSURD WORK WEEKS AND OCCASIONALLY I CAN ACTUALLY HAVE FREE TIME ON THE WEEKEND THE ONLY REASON YOU SHOULD DO A PHYSICS PHD IS IF YOU REALLY WANT TO DO PHYSICS BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH YOU GET A GOOD SALARY AND BENEFITS ONCE YOU FINALLY GET A FULL TIME JOB EITHER IN INDUSTRY OR ACADEMIA GRAD SCHOOL IS VERY HARD AND TAKES A LOT OF PERSONAL SACRIFICE OVER THE COURSE OF OR SO YEARS AND IT CAN TURN A LOT OF IDEALISTS INTO CYNICS
SPEAKING AS A CURRENT PHYSICS MAJOR 3RD YEAR
AT MY UNIVERSITY I THINK THE WORKLOAD SEEMS ON PAR WITH ENGINEERING

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

PHYSICS IS MORE FOCUSED ON THE THEORETICAL CERTAINLY GEARED TOWARDS GRAD SCHOOL ON THE OTHER HAND ENGINEERING WILL GIVE YOU A MORE HANDS ON APPROACH MY ENGINEERING FRIENDS ARE ALWAYS BUILD SOMETHING AND DOING PROJECTS IF HANDS ON IS YOUR THING ENGINEERING IS YOUR GAME SKILLS ARE ALSO A BIT MORE SPECIFIC THAN PHYSICS THIS CAN BE BETTER FOR ENTERING THE WORK FORCE BECAUSE YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO DO WHAT YOUR EMPLOYER WILL WANT


THE LAST WORD

TALK TO YOUR ADVISOR THEY WILL LET YOU KNOW HOW YOU CAN SET UP YOUR COURSES SO THAT YOU COULD TAKE EITHER MAJOR A YEAR OR SO DOWN THE ROAD MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANT WHEN THEY FIRST GET TO COLLEGE YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE SOME PHYSICS FOR ENGINEERING ANYWAYS SO ITS FEASIBLE TO SWAP IF YOU FIND YOURSELF DRAWN IN AND WANTING TO KNOW WHY OR HOW MORE FOR THE SAKE OF JUST KNOWING RATHER THAN FOR THE ABILITY TO APPLY IT THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO INTO PHYSICS REALLY ITS ABOUT WHAT MAKES YOU FEEL FULFILLED AT THE END OF THE DAY

CURRENT ENGINEERING UNDERGRAD WITH A LOVE OF PHYSICS YOU COULD ALWAYS DO WHAT I MEAN DOING MINOR IN IT AND PURSUE IT LATER ENGINEERING WILL OPEN UP MORE CAREER OPPORTUNITIES BUT THE MINOR OR DOUBLE MAJOR IF YOU'RE CRAZY WILL ALLOW YOU TO KEEP OPTIONS OPEN
UNDERGRAD DEGREE IN PHYSICS AND GEOGRAPHY HERE I WILL SAY THAT YOUR WORKLOAD WILL BE WAY HIGHER THAN ANY OTHER MAJOR I SPENT ABOUT TIMES LONGER WORKING ON PHYSICS THAN I DID ON MY GEOGRAPHY MAJOR ONE THING THAT PEOPLE FORGET ABOUT WHEN TALKING ABOUT JOBS IS THAT YOU DONT HAVE TO GET A PHYSICIST JOB AFTER COLLEGE MOST S T TYPE JOBS WILL HAVE A SPECIFIC MAJOR THAT IS APPLICABLE AND THEN SAY OR PHYSICS TAKE A CHEMIST FOR EXAMPLE YOU LEARN SO MUCH IN PHYSICS ABOUT ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND CHEMICAL INTERACTIONS THAT YOU STILL ARE QUALIFIED FOR THE JOB SAME IS TRUE FOR GRADUATE DEGREES MOST ENGINEERING GRADUATE PROGRAMS WILL ACCEPT PHYSICS UNDERGRADUATE DEGREES WITH MAYBE THE NEED FOR ONE OR TWO ADDITIONAL FOUNDATIONAL CLASSES

WHILE I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR MYSELF WHENEVER PEOPLE FIND OUT THAT I HAVE A PHYSICS DEGREE THEY ALWAYS HAVE THE SAME REACTION WOW THAT SOUNDS INTENSE OR WOW YOU MUST BE SMART MY DEGREE IN PHYSICS HAS OPENED SO MANY DOORS FOR ME AND HAS ALLOWED ME TO HAVE MANY DIFFERENT CAREER OPTIONS
I PERSONALLY WENT WITH MY GUTS AND TOOK PHYSICS MATH OVER ENGINEERING
I MIGHT BE LATE TO THE DISCUSSION BUT I'D LIKE TO PUT MY TWO CENTS IN

DON'T DECLARE A MAJOR UNTIL YOU HAVE TO WORST CASE SCENARIO IS YOU FIND OUT YOU DON'T LOVE PHYSICS OR ENGINEERING THEN YOU CAN JUST SWITCH TO SOMETHING ELSE IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'LL BE LOCKED INTO YOUR MAJOR ONCE YOU DECLARE IT BUT JUST TAKE GEN EDS FOR YOUR FIRST 2 OR SEMESTERS AND FIT IN AS MANY PHYSICS OR ENGINEERING CLASSES AS YOU CAN

I WILL SAY THAT I'VE FOUND PHYSICS STUDENTS CAN EASILY ADAPT TO ENGINEERING BUT THE CONVERSE MAY NOT BE TRUE HONESTLY WHETHER OR NOT YOU'LL GET A JOB DEPENDS MORE ON YOUR CONNECTIONS AS LONG AS YOU NETWORK AND MAKE FRIENDS YOU SHOULD BE FINE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE THE NEXT SUPERSTAR BUT THAT'S A DIFFERENT MATTER
I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME TO RESPOND TO THIS BUT I'M CURRENTLY AN UNDERGRAD MAJOR SO I GO TO A SCHOOL FOR YEARS TO GET A PHYSICS DEGREE AND THEN I GO TO ANOTHER SCHOOL FOR 2 YEARS TO GET AN ENGINEERING DEGREE BOTH OR BACHELORS BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING YOU SHOULD CHECK OUT
UNDERGRAD HERE 3RD YEAR IN NUCLEAR ENGINEERING BS MINOR IN MATH PLANNING ON GRADUATE STUDY IN MEDICAL PHYSICS MS OR PHD I THINK MY SITUATION IS KIND OF DIFFERENT AS I AM IN AN ENGINEERING MAJOR THAT RELIES VERY HEAVILY ON PHYSICS AND MATH MUCH MORE SO THAN OTHER MAJORS AT MY SCHOOL MECHANICAL INDUSTRIAL CIVIL ETC I AM MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN PHYSICS AND MATH THAN THE ENGINEERING WHICH MOSTLY CONSISTS OF DESIGN IF YOU ARE UNSURE AND HAVE A DESIRE IN PHYSICS LOOKING INTO AN ENGINEERING PROGRAM THAT RELIES HEAVILY ON PHYSICS MY SCHOOL OFFERS NUCLEAR AND ENGINEERING PHYSICS PERSONALLY I FEEL AS SOMEONE WITH A BS ENGINEERING DEGREE WILL BE RECRUITED MORE THAN SOMEONE WITH A BS IN PHYSICS I FEEL LIKE DEGREES IN FIELDS LIKE PHYSICS ARE BEST AT THE GRADUATE LEVEL AND IF YOU HAVE AN INTEREST IN DOING RESEARCH
PEOPLE IN THIS COMMENT SECTION HAVE NO CLUE WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT DON'T LISTEN TO THESE PEOPLE LOOK UP JOBS GOOGLE PHYSICS JOBS AND SEE WHAT COMES UP I GUARANTEE YOU WILL SEE A LOT OF HEALTH PHYSICS JOBS DOSIMETRY USO ENGINEERING AND ADVISING JOBS YOU KNOW HOW I KNOW I JUST LOOKED

YOU CAN'T GET A JOB WITH A IN PHYSICS WHAT YOUR ENTIRE DEGREE IS BASED IN LEARNING HOW THINGS MOVE AND INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER YOU ARE HEAVILY PADDED IN MATH AND YOU KNOW MECHANICS IF YOU CAN'T FIND A JOB FROM THIS TRAINING IT IS YOU NOT YOUR EDUCATION

YOU DO NOT NEED GRADUATE STUDIES THIS IS SUCH HOG WASH LISTEN IF YOU WANT TO RESEARCH ANYTHING YOU WILL NEED A PHD THIS IS NOT NEW YOU CAN PERHAPS GET A TECH POSITION OR A HELPING POSITION WITHOUT A PHD BUT WHY WOULD YOU NOT GET A PHD IF RESEARCH IS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO

LET ME GIVE YOU A TIP YOUR DEGREE DOESN'T GIVE YOU A PAYCHECK YOUR VALUE GIVES YOU THE PAYCHECK SO NO MATTER WHAT FIELD YOU WANT TO WORK IN ENGINEERING COMPUTER SCIENCE HEALTH PHYSICS CHEMISTRY FINANCES ETC IT IS UP TO YOU TO MAKE YOURSELF EMPLOYABLE AND ON THIS TOPIC ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY IN THE GOVERNMENT LOVE PHYSICS ACTUALLY MOST POSITIONS IN THE GOVERNMENT LOVE PHYSICS DEGREES BECAUSE OF THE BROAD APPLICATIONS

YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE TEACHING THERE IS A HUGE SHORTAGE OF MATH AND PHYSICS TEACHERS HONESTLY NOT MY FIRST CHOICE BUT IF YOU LOVE TEACHING THERE YOU GO

ALSO LET'S GET REAL FOR A SECOND A PHYSICS MAJOR OPENS A DOOR TO VIEW THE UNIVERSE IT GIVES YOU A GLIMPSE INTO HOW THINGS WORK IT BUILDS THE LIST OF QUESTIONS THAT YOU CAN ANSWER AND UNDERSTAND THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE ANYBODY WHO ARGUES WITH THIS HAS NO RIGHT BEING IN THE SCIENCES OR IS CLEARLY IGNORANT TO WHAT A PHYSICS DEGREE IS I EAST FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF THE UNIVERSE

SO NUMBER ALL OF YOU COMP SCI OR ENG OR NOTHING PEOPLE STICK IT UP YOUR REAR THE JOBS FOR PHYSICS ARE COUNTLESS INCLUDING COMP AND ENG YOU JUST NEED TO SEE WHERE YOU FIT IT IF YOU EXPECT A DEGREE TO OPEN EVERY DOOR THAT'S YOUR ISSUE NO DEGREE DOES THAT A PHYSICS DEGREE IS AN INCREDIBLE ARSENAL TO HAVE ON YOUR TOOL BELT AND IS A FANTASTIC DEGREE FOR JOB EMPLOYABILITY AND MENTAL GROWTH
I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS CHANNEL FOR A WHILE SIMPLY LOVE IT
THERE IS A COLLOQUIUM TALK AT MIT ON DECEMBER 8TH ON THE MANY WORLDS INTERPRETATION SEAN CARROLL IS GIVING IT SO IT SHOULD BE GOOD
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE DESCRIBING SECOND HARMONIC GENERATION
YES JUST BY VIRTUE OF T SYMMETRY ACTING ON STIMULATED EMISSION
IN ADDITION TO THE ALREADY MENTION SECOND HARMONIC GENERATION THERE IS ALSO THE PHOTON UNCONVERSION PROCESS IN WHICH A TARGET IS BROUGHT INTO AN EXCITED STATE THAT HAS SOME AND WITHIN THAT IT ADSORBS A SECOND PHOTON AND THE ADSORPTION PROCESS IN WHICH A SINGLE TARGET ADSORBS TWO PHOTONS SIMULTANEOUSLY BOTH PROCESSES ARE EXPLOITED IN AN EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUE KNOWN AS PHOTOELECTRON SPECTROSCOPY
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT SISYPHUS COOLING OR LASER COOLING IN GENERAL
TO BE CLEAR WHAT YOU ARE DESCRIBING WOULDN'T BE CALLED STIMULATED ABSORPTION STIMULATED ABSORPTION AND PLAIN OLD ABSORPTION REFER TO THE SAME THING SINCE YOU NEED THE PHOTON TO STIMULATE THE TRANSITION THIS NOMENCLATURE MAKES SENSE BECAUSE THE EINSTEIN COEFFICIENTS FOR ABSORPTION AND STIMULATED EMISSION ARE EQUAL TO EACH OTHER WHEN THE TWO STATES HAVE THE SAME DEGENERACY
TWO PHOTON EXCITATION IS USED ALL THE TIME IN ORGANICS SO THAT THE EXCITATION PHOTONS ARE ONLY HALF THE ENERGY OF THE FLUORESCING PHOTONS NO ONE CALLS IT STIMULATED ABSORPTION THOUGH

THERE IS ALSO EXCITED STATE ABSORPTIONS WHERE YOU POPULATE SOME STATE BY MEANS OF PHOTOEXCITATION THEN ANOTHER PHOTON CAN BRING THE PARTICLE ELECTRON HOLE EXCITON WHATEVER TO ANOTHER EXCITED STATE STARTING FROM THAT FIRST EXCITED STATE AGAIN NO ONE CALLS THIS A STIMULATED ABSORPTION
ABSORPTION IS STIMULATED ABSORPTION BUT 2 PHOTON GAIN IS PROBABLY WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION CHECK OUT OPTICS FOR EXAMPLES OF PROCESSES THESE REQUIRE THE HIGH FLUX AND COHERENCE AVAILABLE IN LASERS
SIC THE TITLE WHICH IS KIND OF CLICKBAITY BUT NOT ENOUGH FOR R SAVEDYOUACLICK BUT IT NEEDS SOME EXPOSITION

THE 3D PRINTER SPITS OUT UNMAGNETIZED PARAMAGNETIC DUST SUSPENDED IN A PLASTIC MATRIX TO MAKE SHAPES THAT WOULD BE EXPENSIVE OR IMPOSSIBLE TO MOLD NORMALLY BUT THAT'S JUST 3D PRINTING SHAPES WHICH ISN'T ALL THAT NEW

THEN THE OBJECT IS MAGNETIZED AFTER IT'S MOLDED THE ARTICLE IS UNCLEAR ON THE MAGNETIZATION PROCESS IN PARTICULAR WHETHER IT CAN VARY THE MAGNETIC FIELD STRENGTH OVER THE SURFACE OF THE OBJECT OR IS CONSTANT AND THE SHAPE OF THE OBJECT FORMS ALL OF THE SPATIAL VARIATION IN THE MAGNETIC FIELD

IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE LAYING DOWN MAGNETIC DOMAINS IN THE FINAL PATTERN WITH THE PRINTER TO MAKE COMPLEX INTERNAL MAGNETIZATION PATTERNS

THEY ALSO DON'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT MAYBE USING MATERIALS WITH DIFFERENT IMPERMEABILITIES I'LL HAPPILY TAKE THOSE ROYALTIES IF THEY HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF IT YET

WHILE CHECKING TO SEE IF THIS WAS POSTED I FOUND POSTINGS ABOUT COMPLEX MAGNETS HERE

R PHYSICS COMMENTS
SMARTER EVERY DAY DID A VIDEO ON POLYMAGNET THERE WAS ONE THAT ACTED LIKE A LOCK AND KEY COMPLETELY AMAZING STUFF I'M PRETTY SURE THE GUY IS A REDDITION IF YOU SEE THIS NEVER STOP MAKING VIDEOS
I HAVE A BACHELOR'S IN CS AND AM CONSIDERING EXPLORING PHYSICS FOR ACADEMIA WOULD I NEED TO GET A DIFFERENT BACHELORS IN PHYSICS IF I EVENTUALLY WANTED TO BE A PROFESSOR RESEARCHER OR WOULD I BE ABLE TO GET A MASTERS DOES ANYONE HAVE ADVICE FOR EXPLORING PHYSICS MORE BEFORE MAKING A DECISION BOOKS ARTICLES ETC

ALSO I READ THAT MANY PHS ARE KICKED OUT OF RESEARCHING AFTER GETTING THEIR PHD HOW COMMON IS THAT REALLY
I OFTEN SEE PEOPLE HERE SAY SOMETHING ABOUT HOW THE EMPLOYABILITY OF PHYSICS MAJORS ISNT BAD THAT PEOPLE WANT TO HIRE THEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE MATHS TECHNICAL SKILLS AND ARE PROBLEM SOLVERS

THIS IS TRUE AND ALL BUT LIKE SURELY AS AN EMPLOYER YOU WOULD ALSO WANT PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY TRAINED FOR THE JOB THAT YOURE HIRING FOR AND WHILE ITS TRUE THAT MAYBE THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT HAS MORE MATHS THAN PHYSICS MAJORS ARE MATHS PEOPLE THE MATHS AS APPLIED IN PHYSICS ARE WELL APPLIED IN PHYSICS

SO I GUESS WHAT I'M ASKING IS WHAT JOBS SPECIFICALLY NOT ACADEMIA DO PEOPLE MEAN WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT EMPLOYING PHYSICS MAJORS DO YOU NEED TO MINOR IN SOMETHING TAKE EXTRA CLASSES AS UNDERGRAD WHAT ARE THE STATISTICS OFC APPROXIMATELY BECAUSE YEA DEFINITELY THEYRE EVERYWHERE BUT LIKE FINANCE GUY IN IS HARDLY COMMON WHAT DOES WORKING OUTSIDE PHYSICS ENTAIL LIKE WHAT DO YOU NEED

SORRY THE QUESTIONS ARE EVERYWHERE BUT BASICALLY I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A HOLD OF WHAT THE JOB MARKET IS LIKE
I AM APPLYING TO MATH GRADUATE SCHOOLS BUT I AM INTERESTED IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS ESPECIALLY STUFF THAT INTERSECTS ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY

WHAT ARE THE BEST SCHOOLS FOR THIS KIND OF STUFF IN THE US
I AM CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF APPLYING TO GRAD SCHOOL IN MOST OF THE PROGRAMS THAT I AM CONSIDERING THERE IS ONE OR TWO PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR WITH WHOM I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO WORK

IS IT CONSIDERED NORMAL BEHAVIOR FOR ME TO EMAIL THESE PEOPLE EVEN THOUGH I DONT KNOW THEM I WANT TO KNOW IF WORKING WITH THEM WOULD BE AN OPTION TO GET THERE AND FIND OUT THAT THEY ARENT REALLY LOOKING TO TAKE ON STUDENTS WOULD BE REALLY DISAPPOINTING

2 A BIG CONCERN OF MINE IS THAT ALTHOUGH THESE PEOPLE WORK ON THE PROBLEMS I AM INTERESTED IN THEY MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY WORK WITH HOW CAN I BEST GET A FEEL FOR THIS VIA AN EMAIL INTERACTION

HOW MUCH IS IT OK FOR ME TO ASK THESE PEOPLE RANDOM QUESTIONS ABOUT THE GRAD PROGRAM BY RANDOM QUESTIONS I MEAN HOW DOES FUNDING WORK BY YOU HOW SET IN STONE IS THE CURRICULUM ETC

WHAT SHOULD I FIND OUT FROM SOMEONE IF I AM CONSIDERING WORKING WITH THEM I AM HOPING THAT THE COLLECTIVE WISDOM AND EXPERIENCE OF R PHYSICS MIGHT HAVE SOME ADVICE ALONG THE LINES OF IF I KNEW THEN WHAT I KNOW NOW I WOULD-BE ASKED XYZ

TIA
I'M A SENIOR ASTRO MAJOR WITH A MINOR IN CS GOING TO DO POORLY ON THE AGRE GOING TO DO WELL ON THE REGULAR ONE AND THEN APPLY TO A MILLION THINGS SCHOOLS JOBS ETC I DON'T REALLY HAVE A QUESTION I'M JUST FREAKING OUT ANY ADVICE TO DEALING WITH THE FACT THAT THE FUTURE IS INCREDIBLY UNCERTAIN
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN COMMENTING LATELY ON THE LACK OF EMPLOYMENT FOR PHS ARE THERE ANY FIELDS OF PHYSICS THAT ARE MORE EMPLOYABLE THAN OTHERS
SO I'M FINISHING UP MY UNDERGRADUATE IN DEGREES IN MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE I'VE RUN ACROSS SOME UNIVERSITIES WITH CS MASTER PHD PROGRAMS AIMED AT THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE WHICH IS HONESTLY ABOUT THE ONLY THING WHICH INTERESTS ME IN CS

ALTHOUGH THIS MAY BE A PIPE DREAM BUT THE MOST INTERESTING OF ALL IS QUANTUM COMPUTING I'M JUST WONDERING IF THAT IS A BIG HILL TO CLIMB FOR SOMEONE WITHOUT A BACKGROUND IN CLASSICAL PHYSICS

ITS WORTH NOTING I'VE HOPPED AROUND A NUMBER OF FIELDS DURING MY UNDERGRADUATE TIME PARTICULARLY ALGORITHMIC AI COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE ANALYSIS NUMBER THEORY DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS

IF I COULD JUMP SHIP AND DO IT AGAIN I THINK I'D HAVE GONE PHYSICS AND STUDIED ORBITAL MECHANICS OR SOMETHING
I'M PLANNING ON APPLYING TO GRADUATE SCHOOL THIS FALL AND WAS WONDERING IF ANYONE COULD RECOMMEND GROUPS IN THE US WORKING IN NONLINEAR DYNAMICS COMPLEX SYSTEMS I AM ONLY FAMILIAR WITH INDIVIDUALS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SANTE FE INSTITUTE AND NESSI

I'M ALSO RETAKING THE AGRE AND WAS WONDERING HOW MUCH I SHOULD BOTHER APPLYING TO TOP RANKED PROGRAMS IF I SCORE POORLY AGAIN I SCORED PERCENTILE LAST OCT AND AFTER STUDYING HAVE A FEELING I CAN GET AT MOST

YOU WANT TO USE THE HAMILTONIAN IN THE ROTATING FRAME TO FIND THE WAVEFUNCTION AND THEN TRANSFORM BACK INTO THE LAB FRAME

THE WHOLE POINT IS THAT THE ROTATING FRAME HAS A DIFFERENT HAMILTONIAN THAN THE LAB FRAME SO THE SPECIF FUNCTIONAL FORMS OF THE EIGENFUNCTION WILL BE DIFFERENT
SO IN OTHER WORDS THE PURPOSE OF LIFE IS TO HASTEN THE PROCESS THAT WILL LEAD TO THE EVENTUAL HEAT DEATH OF THE UNIVERSE NOT A VERY SATISFYING ANSWER BUT I GUESS IT WRAPS THINGS UP NEAT AND TIDY
THE BRITISH PHYSICIST THEOLOGIAN JOHN POLKINGHORNE LIKES TO POSE THE QUESTION WHY IS THE TEA KETTLE BOILING AS IS THE CASE WITH MANY WHY QUESTIONS THERE ARE MULTIPLE LEVELS OF EXPLANATION LEVEL IS THAT THE WATER HAS WARMED TO THE BOILING POINT AS A RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN ENTROPY ASSOCIATED WITH COMBUSTION LEVEL 2 IS THAT THE STOVE AND TEA KETTLE WERE ENGINEERED IN SUCH A WAY AS TO MAKE THIS BOILING OCCUR THE ULTIMATE LEVEL OF EXPLANATION FOR WHY THE KETTLE IS BOILING ARISES FROM THE FACT THAT MRS POLKINGHORNE WANTS A CUP OF TEA

YOU CAN ADD MORE LEVELS OF CAUSATION FOR THE BOILING KETTLE AND EVEN SOME ABOVE THAT LAST LEVEL BUT A LAYMAN WHO ASKS ABOUT THE MEANING OF LIFE USUALLY IS ASKING ABOUT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF CAUSATION AND HE OR SHE MIGHT BE CONFUSED BY A VIDEO LIKE THIS ONE WITH ITS EXPLANATION OF LOW-LEVEL MECHANISMS THE UNSPOKEN IMPLICATION BY SEAN CARROLL IS THAT THERE IS NO EXISTENTIAL MEANING OF LIFE OR THAT SUCH A CONCEPT IS MEANINGLESS TO BEGIN WITH
YOU PASS BUTTER
THIS MIGHT BE THE PERFECT THREAD FOR THIS
WHAT IS JEREMY ENGLAND

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND WATCHING IT
I FREAKING LOVED THIS BIG PICTURE SERIES THE QUESTION OF IF THE UNIVERSE TENDS TOWARDS HIGH ENTROPY LOW ENERGY STATES WHY DOES SOMETHING SO COMPLEX SUCH AS LIFE EVEN EXIST IS ONE THAT HAS PLAGUED ME FOR A LONG TIME I LOVE THAT THEY EXPLORED THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE REALMS OF ENTROPY VS COMPLEXITY AND COMPLEXITY VS ENERGY
IT SEEMS THEY ARE TRYING TO SOLVE A PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION WITH PURE SCIENTIFIC REASON I'M SURE ANYONE CAN SEE THE FLAW IN THAT IN FACT THE QUESTION ITSELF IS TOO AMBIGUOUS AND BROAD I THINK THE QUESTION WE MEAN TO ASK HERE IS WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF CONCIOUSNESS BEING ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SPECIFIC BUT MB THAT'S JUST ME LOL
A HAMMER HAS A PURPOSE IF A HUMAN USES IT THE HAMMER DOESN'T HAVE A PURPOSE IF THERE ISN'T A HUMAN

SAYING PURPOSE IS TO INCREASE ENTROPY ONLY MAKES SENSE IF WE ASSUME THERE'S A BEING WHO EITHER CREATED OR IS ACTIVELY USING LIFE TO SPEED UP THE HEAT DEATH OF THE UNIVERSE
I'M NOT SURE THE SCIENCE CHECKS OUT IF SUNLIGHT SHINES ON A BARREN ROCK IT HEATS THE ROCK UP THE ROCK RADIATES IR LIGHT AND ENTROPY IS INCREASED IMMEDIATELY IF SUNLIGHT SHINES ON A TREE THE TREE STORES SOME OF THAT ENERGY IN CHEMICAL BONDS WHICH LAST FOR YEARS BEFORE EVENTUALLY GETTING BROKEN DOWN AND CONVERTED INTO WASTE HEAT AS THE TREE DIES AND DECOMPOSES IT S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN USING A MEGAJOULE OF ENERGY TO POWER A HEATER VS USING THE ENERGY TO CHARGE A BATTERY WAITING AN HOUR THEN USING THE BATTERY TO POWER THE HEATER AT THE END OF THE DAY ALL THE ENERGY GETS CONVERTED TO THE SAME AMOUNT OF HEAT IF YOU RE DOING THIS WITH A LOT OF BATTERIES THE AVERAGE RATE OF CONVERSION IS ROUGHLY CONSTANT NO MATTER HOW MANY BATTERIES YOU HAVE BUT WHENEVER YOU ADD A BUNCH OF NEW BATTERIES TO THE SYSTEM IT TEMPORARILY SLOWS DOWN THE CONVERSION SINCE YOU HAVE MORE BATTERIES CHARGING THAN DISCHARGING AND WHEN YOU REMOVE A BUNCH OF BATTERIES YOU TEMPORARILY INCREASE THE CONVERSION SINCE YOU HAVE MORE BATTERIES DISCHARGING THAN CHARGING RIGHT NOW HUMANS ARE DISCHARGING AND REMOVING A LOT OF OLD BATTERIES FOSSIL FUELS COAL NUCLEAR POWER ETC BUT WE ALSO HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO COLONIZE THE GALAXY AND PUT NEW AND BETTER BATTERIES ON BARREN PLANETS IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER WE LL HAVE BUILT UP A STOCKPILE OF BATTERIES BY THE TIME THE UNIVERSE WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE HIT HEAT DEATH OR IF WE LL BRING ABOUT HEAT DEATH SOONER BY FINDING AND DISCHARGING NATURE S BATTERIES FASTER THAN THEY WOULD NORMALLY DISCHARGE THEMSELVES
WHATEVER THE PURPOSE IS CLEARLY IT IS UNIMPORTANT BECAUSE THE UNIVERSE FUNCTIONS PRETTY WELL WITHOUT IT

UNLESS OF COURSE PURPOSE WAS TO EVOLVE TO A POINT WHERE WE CAN PREVENT THE HEAT DEATH OF THE UNIVERSE THEN LIFE BECOMES A SURVIVAL MECHANISM FOR THE UNIVERSE ITSELF
I STILL STRUGGLE WITH LABELLING HIGHER LOWER ENTROPY STATES IT JUST FEELS SO

COFFEE AND MILK IN 2 SEPARATE GLASSES HIGH ENTROPY DISORDER
COFFEE AND MILK MIXED TOGETHER LOW ENTROPY DISORDER
WTF IS THAT EVEN RIGHT
I HEARD AN ANSWER ONE TIME ABOUT WHAT THE PURPOSE OF LIFE IS

THEY TOLD ME THAT THE PURPOSE OF LIFE IS TO SUCCESSFULLY REPRODUCE

NOT TO REPRODUCE BUT TO DO IT SUCCESSFULLY

FOR SOME ORGANISMS THAT'S A SIMPLE PROCESS

BUT FOR HUMANS

THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO HAVE AND TEACH YOUR OFFSPRING EMOTIONAL STABILITY TO LEARN AND TEACH YOUR OFFSPRING PROPER SOCIAL SKILLS ETC TO BE SERENE AND TO PRODUCE AND TEACH OTHERS HOW TO BE SERENE

IT WAS A RATHER INTERESTING ALL INCLUSIVE LAWS OF NATURE OBEYING ANSWER THAT HAS LEFT ME RATHER SATISFIED

TL R BECOME A HEALTHY INDIVIDUAL AND PRODUCE HEALTHY OFFSPRING EMOTIONALLY HEALTHY SOCIALLY HEALTHY PHYSICALLY HEALTHY ETC

I THINK IM GETTING IT IN MY OWN WORDS ITS NOT ABOUT THE STATE OF A SYSTEM AT ANY GIVEN TIME BUT MORE ABOUT THE POTENTIAL POSSIBILITIES HAMM THAT MIGHT SOUND FUNNY BUT IM DEFINITELY STARTING TO GET MY HEAD AROUND IT CHEERS
EXCELLENT WAY OF LOOKING AT IT
SO HYDROGENATING CARBON DIOXIDE TO CREATE METHANE IS THE PURPOSE OF LIFE GUESS KURT WAS RIGHT

I TELL YOU WE ARE HERE ON EARTH TO FART AROUND AND DON'T LET ANYBODY TELL YOU DIFFERENT KURT VONNEGUT


ANYONE INTERESTED IN CELLULAR ORGANIZATION MAY BE INTERESTED IN A RECENT TALK BY DR MICHAEL ROSEN BY APPLYING PRINCIPLES OF POLYMER CHEMISTRY AND PHASE TRANSITIONS TO BIOLOGY HIS LAB HAS MADE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS IN IMPROVING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF CELLULAR ORGANIZATION AT THE LENGTH

VIDEO ROSEN

PURPOSE MEANS A CONSCIOUS INTENTION

I REALLY HATE TO SEE IT USED TO REFER TO INANIMATE OBJECTS WHICH AVE NEITHER CONSCIOUSNESS NOT INTENTION

I'M NOT JUST BEING PEDANTIC

IT LEADS IDIOTS LIKE SCHOPENHAUER TO CLAIM THAT THE INANIMATE UNIVERSE HAS WILL AND MANY OTHER IDIOTS TO CLAIM THAT IF THE UNIVERSE HAS A PURPOSE IT MUST HAVE BEEN PUT THERE BY A DEITY

AN APPLE DOESN'T FALL BECAUSE IT WANTS TO OR BECAUSE THAT'S ITS PURPOSE

THAT KIND OF TALK JUST ENCOURAGES SPIRITUALISTS AND NEW AGE KOOKS
JUST GOTTA LOVE HEARING SEAN CARROLL IN THOSE VIDEOS
I WISH I COULD GET BACK TO JUST LIVING AND NOT THINKING ABOUT THE MEANING OF LIFE DEATH AND WHAT COMES AFTER I JUST FIND IT SO HARD TO ACCEPT THAT I AND EVERYONE I KNOW AND EVER KNEW WILL DIE AND THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT
FUCK
THAT BRINGS BACK MEMORIES I LOVED WATCHING THIS SERIES WHEN I WAS IN GRADE SCHOOL
OPTICS JUST DIDN'T MAKE SENSE ON FIRST PASSIVE REALLY HAD TO WORK HARD TO UNDERSTAND IT
ELECTROMAGNETISM I'VE NEVER WIPED ON AN EXAM AS HARD AS I DID IN THAT ONE AT UNIVERSITY EQUATIONS UGH NEVER BEEN A FAN OF THAT TOPIC MY FRIENDS ON THE COURSE THOUGHT IT WAS HILARIOUS SO I GOT THE LAST LAUGH THE FOLLOWING YEAR WHEN SOLID STATE PHYSICS AND CONDENSATES WERE AN OPEN BOOK TO ME BUT THEY STRUGGLED
I HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME PROBLEM AS YOU BUT WITH SPECIAL RELATIVITY I JUST COULD NOT DO IT EVERYTHING I HAVE DONE BEFORE AND SINCE HAVE BEEN EASY QUANTUM AND CLASSICAL MECHANICS TERMOSTATISTICS STRUGGLED A BIT AT THE START BUT OVERCOME IT AND SOLID STATE BUT SPECIAL RELATIVITY MY MIND GOES FULL DUMB
THERE WAS A CLASS ADVANCED MECHANICS JUST THAT MECHANICS FROM LIKE NEWTOWN TO EINSTEIN JUST SOLVING PROBLEMS

I FAILED THE FIRST HALF OF THAT COURSE IT JUST DID NOT CLICK I FELT LIKE A MORON EVERY TIME THE PROF WAS LIKE OH WELL SEE HERE THE STRING LENGTH ALLOWS YOU TO FORMULATE BULLY XS MOTION IN TERMS OF YS OR WHATEVER

FUCK THAT COURSE FUCK EINSTEIN FUCK LAGRANGE FUCK HAMILTONIAN WHOEVER NAETHER IS CHILL SHE CAN STAY BUT FUCK THE REST
I'M ASHAMED TO ADMIT BUT NEWTONIAN MECHANICS I THOUGHT I KNEW THEM PERFECTLY WHEN IN REALITY I WAS OBSESSED WITH QUANTUM MECHANICS BEFORE EVEN FULLY GRASPING BASICS WHEN I WAS IN FIRST YEAR PHYSICS I GUESS A COMMON MISTAKE TO LOOK FURTHER INTO THE HORIZON BEFORE IDENTIFYING NEAR OBJECTS
AT THE MOMENT I'M HAVING REAL TROUBLE WITH BOTH WAVE PHYSICS AND QUANTUM PHYSICS I THINK MY PROBLEM IS THAT I'VE GOT ALL THESE WAVE EQUATIONS FLOATING ABOUT BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN AND I CAN'T VISUALISER THEM
STATISTICAL MECHANICS VISUALIZING IT WASN'T SO BAD BUT THE MATH WAS HORRENDOUS I LIKED CALCULUS WHERE FUNCTIONS WERE SMOOTH AND YOU COULD INTEGRATE I WAS NOT A FAN OF VERY LARGE BUT FINITE SUMS AND FACTORIALS POPPING UP EVERYWHERE ALSO IT WAS VERY HARD TO CHECK YOUR WORK SINCE MORE THAN A HANDFUL OF PARTICLES AND IT WAS PRODUCING NUMBERS TOO LARGE FOR THE CALCULATOR TO HANDLE

THERMODYNAMICS IS MUCH NICER
IN GENERAL SOLVING PROBLEMS OR AT FIRST WORKING THROUGH WORKED EXAMPLES TRYING TO METICULOUSLY UNDERSTAND EVERY SINGLE STEP IS THE BEST APPROACH TO UNDERSTANDING CONCEPTS AND THEORIES YOU'RE STRUGGLING WITH AT THE MOMENT I'M STRUGGLING WITH SECOND QUANTITATION SO DOING LOTS OF PROBLEMS ON IT

EDIT THE SCHRODINGER EQUATION I FOUND A REAL PAIN ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT CROPS UP IN SO MANY DIFFERENT FORMS AND NOTATIONS BUT THE BEST WAY TO GET TO GRIPS WITH IT IS USING IT
CRYSTALLOGRAPHY I STILL DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT
I STRUGGLED REALLY HARD WITH MY FIRST UPPER LEVEL E M CLASS PARTLY BECAUSE I DIDN'T QUITE HAVE THE MATH BACKGROUND FOR IT YET DIDN'T HAVE FOURIER ANALYSIS AND DIDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE DELTA FUNCTIONS AT THE TIME AND PARTLY BECAUSE I HAD A REALLY BAD PROFESSOR OVER HALF THE CLASS HAD TO DROP IT AND TAKE IT AGAIN THE NEXT SEMESTER WITH A DIFFERENT PROFESSOR

WHEN I TOOK E M AGAIN THE FOLLOWING SEMESTER WITH A BETTER PROFESSOR AND MORE MATH UNDER MY BELT SPECIFICALLY FOURIER ANALYSIS I WAS ABLE TO PASS THE CLASSICAL I SEEM TO HAVE TROUBLE LEARNING MATH FROM A PHYSICS CLASS I NEED TO LEARN THE CONCEPTS IN A MATH CLASS FIRST BEFORE I START USING THEM IN PHYSICS
IN HS THINGS GOT HARD FOR ME AT THE PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT
LAWS BACK IN HS I DIDN'T UNDERSTOOD WHY SOMEONE WOULD STUDY WHY SOMETHING MOVES WHEN YOU HAVE KINEMATICS
REMINDME WEEKS
IN GRADUATE SCHOOL I'M TAKING ELECTRODYNAMICS AND QUANTUM I FIND WORKING THROUGH PROBLEMS IN E M TO BE HARDER BUT I FIND THAT I HARDLY EVER UNDERSTAND THE REASONING OF THE METHODS IN QUANTUM
DEFINITELY FLUID MECHANICS
COUPLING HIGHER ORDER ANGULAR MOMENTUM HOLY CRAP IS THAT SOME DRY STUFF WITH AWFUL AND INCONSISTENT NOTATION WHAT GOT ME TO OVERCOME IT IS BASICALLY BEING FORCED TO DO SO IN ORDER TO COMPLETE A PROJECT
MAYBE THE HAMILTON JACOBI AFTER USING IT TO SOLVE SOME CELESTIAL MECHANICS EVERYTHING BECOMES CLEAR
INTERFERENCE AND WAVES IN GENERAL VISUALIZING IT AND SEEING HOW THINGS ARE LINKED TOGETHER ON VIDEOS AND PICTURES REALLY HELPED ME
I DON'T HAVE A COMPLETE ANSWER BUT I THINK WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS TO STOP THINKING OF YOUR ISSUES AS EXCUSES THOSE ARE THE MOST VALID REASONS I'VE EVER HEARD FOR NOT BEING PASSIONATE ABOUT SOMETHING THE FACT THAT YOU HAD SUCH A ROUGH LIFE AND ARE STILL HERE TRYING TO GET BACK INTO PHYSICS IS AMAZING IN ITSELF

HAVE YOU CONSIDERED DONE THERAPY THIS SEEMS LIKE A CLEAR COURSE TO ME GIVEN ALL THE ISSUES YOU'RE EXPERIENCING I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HELP YOU MUCH MORE IT SEEMS PRETTY OBVIOUS TO ME THAT PHYSICS HAS VERY LITTLE TO DO WITH WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH

IN THE MEANTIME YOU MIGHT WANT TO WATCH YOUTUBE VIDEOS FEYNMAN IS ALWAYS A GOOD ONE MAYBE START WITH FUN TO IMAGINE AND MOVE ON TO THE CHARACTER OF PHYSICAL LAW THERE ARE ALSO A BUNCH OF POPULAR PHYSICS CHANNELS LIKE SIXTY SYMBOLS AND MINUTE PHYSICS
ITS QUITE HARD TO GET BACK TO HAVING THAT CHILD LIKE MENTALITY REALLY HARD TO GIVE ADVICE ABOUT SUCH A COMPLICATED THING WITHOUT BEING YOU ID SUGGEST YOU STICK BY IT STUBBORNLY ITS REALLY WORTH IT AND HOPEFULLY EVENTUALLY YOU'LL FIND WHAT YOU USED TO FEEL
ONE WAY TO HELP YOUR PASSION MIGHT BE TO IMMERSE YOURSELF IN VIDEOS READINGS OF PHYSICISTS TALKING ABOUT THEIR PASSIONS ABOUT THEIR WORK I WOULDN'T SUGGEST STARTING WITH ACADEMIC MATERIALS FOR THIS I'D SUGGEST STARTING WITH FASCINATING AND INSPIRATIONAL TED TALK VIDEOS THERE ARE CURRENTLY TED TALKS ON PHYSICS WHERE PHYSICISTS GET MINUTES OR SO TO DESCRIBE THEIR WORK IT'S A GREAT VENUE FOR KINDLING INTERESTS IN PHYSICS

THE PHYSICS TED TALKS CAN BE FOUND HERE

HERE ARE A FEW THAT MIGHT INTEREST YOU HEAVILY WEIGHTED TOWARD RECENT FINDINGS IN COSMOLOGY THE FIELD YOU LOVED AS A KID AND IN ASTROPHYSICS

GIAN GIUDICE WHY OUR UNIVERSE MIGHT EXIST ON A KNIFE-EDGE

ALLAN ADAMS WHAT THE DISCOVERY OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES MEANS

ANDREA GHEZ THE HUNT FOR A SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLE

BRIAN GREENE IS OUR UNIVERSE THE ONLY UNIVERSE

GEORGE SMOOT THE DESIGN OF THE UNIVERSE

SEAN CARROLL DISTANT TIME AND THE HINT OF A MULTIVERSE

MURRAY BEAUTY TRUTH AND PHYSICS

AND THERE ARE A TON OF OTHER FASCINATING VIDEOS AND ARTICLES BESIDES TED TALKS WHICH ARE EASILY DISCOVERABLE WITH GOOGLE SEARCHES FOR EXAMPLE

PBS SPACETIME

MINUTE PHYSICS

THE PHYSICS GIRL

ETC ETC
I HAVE BEEN THROUGH SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING GWINBAR LUCRETIUS AND JRDMB HAVE SAID ESPECIALLY WITH BEING STUBBORN YOU NEED TO BE PATIENT AND PERSISTENT DO WHATEVER YOU LIKE AND YOU WILL MAKE IT EITHER IF IT IS WATCHING YOUTUBE DOCUMENTARIES ABOUT INTERESTING PHYSICS TOPICS OR ABOUT PHYSICISTS THAT INSPIRE YOU YOU CAN READ THEIR BIOGRAPHIES IN WIKIPEDIA TOO YOU CAN WATCH YOUTUBE VIDEOS OF LECTURES FOR EXAMPLE THE SUSSKIND LECTURES ARE VERY GOOD THERE IS EVEN A CLASSICAL MECHANICS LECTURE BY SUSSKIND
ALSO YOU CAN READ LITERATURE BOOKS ABOUT PHYSICS SUCH AS A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME FEYNMAN IS VERY GOOD AS SUGGESTED BY GWINBAR I WOULD DEFINITELY SUGGEST THAT YOU READ SURELY YOU'RE JOKING MR FEYNMAN SIX EASY PIECES AND SIX NOT SO EASY PIECES ALSO LOOK FOR COSMOLOGY BOOKS AND GENERALLY PHYSICS BOOKS THAT ARE WELL RATED IN AMAZON AND GOODREADS
YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR OLD PHYSICS BOOKS OR FIND GOOD GENERAL LOWER LEVEL PHYSICS BOOKS TO DOWNLOAD OR BUY FROM THE INTERNET AND START WORKING ON SOME STUFF LITTLE BY LITTLE EVERY DAY
GOOD LUCK
ASKING HOW DO I RESTORE MY PASSION FOR PHYSICS MEANS THAT THE PASSION IS STILL THERE PERHAPS HIDDEN BUT QUIETLY BURNING IN THE ASHES AND WAITING TO BURN FREE

THINK OF PHYSICS AS WHAT CAN MAKE YOU FREE AND HAPPY

AT PERHAPS YOU ARE TOO OLD TO GO BACK TO COLLEGE BUT PERHAPS NOT BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF THINGS TO DO AS A CITIZEN SCIENTIST WHY DON'T YOU TRY SCIENCE WRITING IN A FEW YEARS YOU COULD BUILD A GOOD CAREER AND A GOOD LIFE AS A FREELANCE SCIENCE WRITER SPECIALIZED IN PHYSICS
READ SCIENCE BOOKS THERE'S PLENTY OUT THERE THAT TYPICALLY AIM TO INSPIRE YOU

WHAT I FIND KEEPS ME MOTIVATED IS PUTTING PHYSICS TO USE FOR EXAMPLE WHILE I'M LEARNING ABOUT SOLID STATE PHYSICS I LOOKED AT THE APPLICATIONS I PUT SOLAR CELLS TOGETHER WORKED WITH LEDS TRANSISTORS DIODES THIS WAY THE PHYSICS BECOMES MORE RELEVANT TO MY LIFE I LOOK AT SOLAR CELLS AND KNOW THAT THE BACK SIDE IS P-TYPE FRONT N-TYPE I HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHY IT WORKS PROMOTION OF ELECTRONS TO THE CONDUCTION BAND ELECTRONS AND HOLES FORWARD BIAS ELECTRON DRIFT AND DIFFUSION THERE MAY BE OTHER WAYS TO DO PHYSICS BUT I THINK IT IS MOST PLEASURABLE WHEN YOU PLAY WITH IT I GUESS IF YOU'RE LESS OF AN PERSON YOU CAN STILL PLAY WITH THEORETICAL MODELS
THESE TWO VIDEOS AND 2 DID IT FOR ME
I ALSO USED TO BE REALLY DEPRESSED AND ALSO LOST MY PASSION FOR SCIENCE I THINK A GOOD THING TO START IS TO FIND SOME AREA YOU ENJOY AND READ SOMETHING ABOUT IT WHAT RESTORED MY LOVE FOR PHYSICS WAS QUANTUM MECHANICS I ENJOYED THAT DAVID QUANTUM MECHANICS AND EXPERIENCE MIGHT BE TOO SUPERFICIAL FOR YOUR CURRENT KNOWLEDGE BUT SHARE WITH YOUR FRIENDS THAT MIGHT BE INTERESTED LONELY SCIENCE IS KINDA BORING TRY TO MAKE SOME FRIENDS WITH THE SAME INTERESTS AS YOU IT'S FUN TO LISTEN WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK SPECIALLY IF THEY DON'T THINK LIKE YOU CAUSE YOU MIGHT SEE THINGS WITH OTHER EYES AND THAT'S ALWAYS GOOD NOW DUNNO HOW THINGS WORK WHERE YOU LIVE BUT ON MY COUNTRY PUBLIC COLLEGES ARE OPEN YOU CAN JUST GO TO SOME PHYSICS DEPARTMENT AND TALK TO PEOPLE EVEN WATCH SOME CLASSES SOME MIGHT BE JERKS OR SOMETHING BUT DON'T LET THAT TURN YOU DOWN BECAUSE MOST PHYSICISTS LOVE TO TALK ABOUT PHYSICS SEE IF THERE'S ANY EVENT YOU CAN PARTICIPATE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT NEAR YOUR AREA I THINK SCIENCE FAIRS IN SCHOOLS NEAR YOU MIGHT BE COOL TOO WATCHING EXPERIMENTS IS A NEAT THING THAT'S WHY I USED TO LIKE SCIENCE WHEN I WAS A CHILD SCIENCE IS MAGIC
LOSS OF MOTIVATION AND LOSS OF HAVING JOY IN THINGS SEEM TO BE TYPICAL SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION NEXT TO THE OTHER GREAT SUGGESTIONS IN THIS THREAD I'D SUGGEST YOU SEEK HELP FOR THAT

IF YOU WANT TO RESTORE YOUR PASSION FOR PHYSICS I WOULD FIRST TRY TO RESTORE YOUR MENTAL HEALTH DEPRESSION IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM
LSD
I THINK YOU'D GET FREE UNLIMITED ENERGY IF YOU JUST KEPT USING THE NORMAL EQUATIONS BUT IF MAGNETIC MONOPOLES EXIST YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THEM INTO A MORE SYMMETRIC FORM SO YOU NO LONGER HAVE DIB ETC
NO HE'S COMPLETELY WRONG
IS THERE ANY THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK WHERE MAGNETIC MONOPOLES COULD CAUSE A VIOLATION OF ENERGY CONSERVATION

NO IT'S UTTERLY RIDICULOUS YOU'RE INTUITION IS COMPLETELY CORRECT I CHECKED THE WIKI SOURCE DRAGONTAMERMCT LINKED AND IT SAYS NOTHING OF THE KIND EITHER I GUESS HE JUST HASN'T A CLUE WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT
THIS IS LIKE ALCHEMY YOU CAN'T TURN PISS INTO GOLD JUST AS YOU CAN'T GENERATE ENERGY FROM NOTHING
THE ANSWER IS NO BECAUSE MAGNETIC MONOPOLES DON'T EXIST
WHERE DO YOU FIND THESE COOL PROBLEMS OR HOW DO YOU COME UP WITH THEM
IN IS Z A CARTESIAN COORDINATE
I'M GOING TO TRY DREAM LATER THIS WEEK JUST BECAUSE OF THE NAME IT WOULD BE EASIER FOR A SPHERICAL BOX THOUGH BUT THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER DREAM I SUPPOSE
I REMEMBER TRYING TO TACKLE IN 2D IN MY FINAL YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL THE QUESTION WE TRIED TO ANSWER WAS SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF IF YOU THREW AN OBJECT OF AN INFINITE CLIFF HORIZONTALLY WOULD THE HORIZONTAL VELOCITY REACH ZERO IN SOME FINITE TIME OR NOT WE FAILED TO SOLVE IT EXACTLY BUT IT WAS PRETTY FUN I LATER FOUND OUT THE EQUATION HAS NO ANALYTIC SOLUTION IN THE WAY WE WANTED TO FIND IT IN 2D
2 AND WERE OLD ONES FROM THE PROBLEMS OF THE WEEK ONLY 2 HAD BEEN SOLVED
IS NOT JUST ZERO
WHY IS THE DRAG PROBLEM SO HARD YOU JUST HAVE TO DO

M FAC DV DT MG AEC V AEC V LAMBDA

AND INTEGRATE THE VELOCITY INTEGRAL WILL HAVE A SOLUTION IN TERMS OF INVERSE TANGENTS OR AM I MISSING SOMETHING
I THINK I SOLVED PROBLEM ONE CAN DECOMPOSE THE INITIAL WAVEFUNCTION I X AS THE SUM OF NIX OVER ALL ODD NOUN THESE FUNCTIONS HAPPEN TO BE ENERGY EIGENSTATE WITH EIGENVALUE I 2 N 2 2 SO THE WAVEFUNCTION AT TIME T TURNS OUT TO BE THE SUM OF NIX E I 2 N 2 T 2 OVER ODD N WHICH GIVES THE DIFFERENCE OF TWO JACOBI THETA FUNCTIONS 2 I X 2 T 2 I X THE PROBABILITY DENSITY AT THE CENTER OF THE BOX IS THEN THE SQUARED MODULUS OF THIS FUNCTION EVALUATED AT X IS THIS RIGHT

EDIT WAIT NO THAT'S NOT RIGHT I X IS NOT NORMALIZED I GUESS I SHOULD WORK WITH A NASCENT DELTA APPROXIMATION
USUALLY FOR UNIVERSITY IN CANADA MOST IF NOT ALL STUDENTS WILL ALREADY HAVE A PROFESSOR WHO HAS ACCEPTED TO SUPERVISE THEIR THESIS WHEN APPLICATION ARE MADE

BASICALLY
IN THE AUTUMN SEMESTER OF THE LAST UNDERGRAD YEAR STUDENTS WILL APPROACH PROFESSOR TO KNOW IF THEY HAVE POSITIONS AVAILABLE IF THEY HAVE FUNDING AND THEY WILL DO APPLICATION FOR GRANTS BY THE END OF THE SEMESTER MOST OF THEM WILL HAVE AN AGREEMENT WITH A PROFESSOR AND HAVE A ROUGHLY ESTIMATE OF WHAT THE RESEARCH WILL BE ABOUT
2 IN THE WINTER SEMESTER THAT'S WHEN THE APPLICATION PROCESS HAPPEN
SOME STUDENTS WILL START WORKING WITH THE PROFESSOR DURING THE SUMMER AND HAVE DEFINED THE RESEARCH PROJECT BY THE FIRST SEMESTER OF GRAD STUDIES

OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN STILL APPLY WITHOUT HAVING AN ARRANGEMENT WITH A PROFESSOR HOWEVER IF A PROFESSOR IS BACKING YOU IT HELPS YOUR APPLICATION PROCESS
ALSO THE SYSTEM WOULD WORK AS IF AT THE START THE ORDER OF PLANETS IN A STRAIGHT HORIZONTAL LINE WOULD BE EARTH MERCURY VENUS MARS JUPITER SATURN URANUS AND NEPTUNE
A YOU LET THEM ACCELERATE ENOUGH TO AVOID ONE ANOTHER'S GRAVITY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND STAY IN ORBIT OR B THEY CLUMP UP AND GET EATEN BY OUR STAR
THE PERIMETER INSTITUTE IN WATERLOO ONTARIO HAS A VERY STRONG CONDENSED MATTER THEORY GROUP
FSU HAS A COUPLE GROUPS IN CONDENSED MATTER I'M NOT SURE OF HOW MUCH ON THE THEORETICAL SIDE THEY ARE THOUGH BUT IT COULD BE WORTH CHECKING OUT HERE'S A LIST OF ALL THE FACULTY MEMBERS AND THEY'RE RESEARCH TOPICS IF YOU INTERESTED AT ALL

CONDENSED MATTER GROUP IS ACTUALLY THEIR BEST PHYSICS GROUP I BELIEVE THEY EVEN WORK CLOSELY WITH INDUSTRY
I DID MY PHD AT MCGILL THEY HAVE A STRONG CONDENSED MATTER THEORY GROUP PROFS COSH CLERK DUO GRANT PROATLAS AND MAYBE SOME THAT I MISSED ALL THE TOP SCHOOLS IN CANADA HAVE STRONG CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS THOUGH IT'S A PRETTY BIG AREA
HE DOES A GREAT JOB OF COMMUNICATING A LOT OF TECHNICAL INFORMATION AS CONCISELY AS POSSIBLE
HE TELLS A COMPELLING STORY OF CREATION

DOES ANYONE HAVE A PDF OF THAT PERIODIC TABLE HE HAS AT THE BEGINNING I WANT TO HANG IT IN MY OFFICE
NICE I'D LIKE TO SEE MORE CONTENT LIKE THIS ON R PHYSICS
THIS IS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE FACT ABOUT THE UNIVERSE THESE ARE SUCH RELATIVELY SIMPLE PROCESSES BUT THE COMPLEXITY THAT RESULTS IS ASTOUNDING
JUST WATCHED THIS SAME TOPIC ON DISCOVERY SCIENCE YESTERDAY
MODEL A PENDULUM AND VARY YOUR LENGTHS USE DIFFERENT SPRINGS ADD FORCING FUNCTIONS ETC AND TRY QUALITATIVELY MODELING THE BEHAVIOR SEE WHAT EFFECTS THE MOTION PERIOD OF THE PENDULUM AND TRY RELATING IT TO OTHER PHYSICAL PHENOMENA YOU SEE EVERY DAY IN LIFE
A MS
A PROBLEM AND A SOLUTION
SOMETHING THAT COULD BENEFIT SOCIETY IN SOME WAY SO IF I HAD BEEN ABLE TO DO PROGRAMMING I COULD MAKE AN AI AND STUDY WHAT MAKES A AI EVEN THOUGH ITS ALREADY BEEN DONE I COULD STILL SAY IT COULD HELP FURTHER STUDIES ON AI AND SOMETHING I'M CAPABLE OF DOING IN TERMS OF REALISM LIKE IF I WERE TO DO SOMETHING ON REAL LIFE CARS I COULDN'T CAUSE I CAN'T DRIVE A CAR



IF I SAID MY QUESTION IMPROPERLY OR ANYTHING JUST TELL ME
AT HIS AGE GRADE THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT ARE REALLY THE BEST TO AIM FOR MATH AND PROGRAMMING MOST OF PHYSICS REQUIRES CALCULUS IT'S JUST HOW THE WORLD WORKS

THERE IS A SHORTCUT THOUGH AND THAT IS PROGRAMMING WHEN I WAS IN 6TH GRADE I MADE A BASIC PHYSICS ENGINE FOR A MOON LANDER STYLE GAME IN ADOBE FLASH AND I WAS ABLE TO WITHIN THE SPAN OF A FEW MONTHS LEARN SOME MORE ADVANCED ALGEBRA TRIGONOMETRY AND WITHOUT REALIZING IT CALCULUS BASICALLY JUST BY FUMBLING AROUND TRYING TO MAKE PHYSICS IN A VIDEOGAME

THERE ARE LOADS OF RESOURCES OUT THERE FOR LEARNING PROGRAMMING KHAN ACADEMY IS PRETTY GREAT FOR IT AND THERE ARE RESOURCES FOR MATH THERE TOO

PLAIN PHYSICS TEXTBOOKS CAN BE PRETTY ROUGH AT HIS AGE SOME KIDS ARE WAY INTO IT BUT IT MIGHT BE BEST TO JUST NUDGE HIM TOWARDS SOME RESOURCES THAT WILL ENABLE HIM TO DO MORE THINGS LATER
WHAT DOES HE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT FOR EIGHTH GRADERS I'D RECOMMEND STUFF TOWARDS SCIENCE DIVULGATION IN GENERAL SUCH AS CARL COSMOS UNIVERSE IN A NUTSHELL AND OTHER STUFF ALIKE
8TH GRADE IS A BIT EARLY FOR A PHYSICS TEXTBOOK HE WOULD DO BETTER WITH A GENERAL PHYSICAL SCIENCE BOOK GEARED TOWARD THAT AGE ANY OF THE MAJOR TEXTBOOK COMPANIES PHYSICAL SCIENCE BOOKS SHOULD BE PRETTY COMPARABLE SO JUST LOOK FOR A CHEAP PEARSON OR OR SOME SUCH FOR ACTUAL INTRO PHYSICS I WOULD GO WITH ALGEBRA BASED TEXT COLLEGE PHYSICS A STRATEGIC APPROACH I'VE NEVER READ IT BUT HIS CALC BASED BOOK IS GOOD HOWEVER I WILL WARN THAT EVEN INTRODUCTORY PHYSICS REQUIRES SOME HARDER ALGEBRA AND TRIGONOMETRY SINCE TEXTBOOKS ARE EXPENSIVE YOU MAY CONSIDER MORE GENERAL BOOKS ABOUT PHYSICS AND SCIENCE

I THINK THAT THE BEST GENERAL SCIENCE INTRO BOOKS ARE THE SCIENCE OF DISCWORLD SERIES BUT IT KIND OF HELPS THAT I AM A HUGE DISCWORLD FAN ANYWAYS THIS BOOK MAY NOT MAKE MUCH SENSE TO SOMEONE THAT HAS NOT READ THE DISCWORLD SERIES BEFORE BUT THE PREMISE IS THAT PRITCHETT WRITES A CHAPTER ABOUT A GROUP OF WIZARDS DOING EXPERIMENTS WITH MAGIC THEN THE NEXT CHAPTER IS A SCIENTIST EXPLAINING THE REAL WORLD ANALOGUE TO THE FANTASTICAL EXPERIMENT RAN BY THE WIZARDS

THERE IS ALSO BILL A SHORT HISTORY OF NEARLY EVERYTHING WHICH IS A VERY ENTERTAINING TOUR THROUGH SCIENCE I KNOW OF AT LEAST ONE MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER WHO USES THIS AS HIS PHYSICAL SCIENCE TEXT IN 9TH GRADE AND THE KIDS LOVE IT
I WAS ALWAYS A FAN OF BRIAN GREENE WHEN I WAS YOUNGER THE FABRIC OF THE COSMOS IS EXCELLENT IT DEFINITELY INSPIRED ME IT EXPLAINS THE STRANGE DEVELOPMENTS OF MODERN PHYSICS IN A AN EASY TO READ AND FASCINATING WAY
I USUALLY RECOMMEND UNDERSTANDING PHYSICS BY ISSAC ASIMOV FOR PEOPLE WITH AN INTEREST BUT NOT A BACKGROUND IN PHYSICS IT'S PRETTY READER FRIENDLY BUT MIGHT BE A BIT HEAVY FOR 8TH GRADE
THE CARTOON GUIDE TO PHYSICS IT'S A GREAT INTRODUCTION TO EVERYTHING FROM NEWTON TO EINSTEIN AND IT'S ACCESSIBLE TO KIDS AND ADULTS ALIKE
MICHAEL FARADAY
MURRAY HAD A REALLY GOOD TALK GOOGLE TOO
LOOK UP THE DISTRIBUTION POTENTIAL OR SEARCH ON FOR ANY OF THE OLDER COSMOLOGICAL SIMULATIONS LIKE THE MILLENNIUM RUN

EDIT THIS PAPER WAS ON THE FIRST PAGE OF GOOGLE RESULTS IF YOU SEARCH FOR MILKY WAY DARK MATTER DISTRIBUTION

ON ANOTHER NOTE IT'S A HUGE RED FLAG TO SAY I HAVE AN IDEA BUT I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THE TOPIC TO KNOW IF IT'S CORRECT BUT I ALSO WANT TO KEEP IT A SECRET IN CASE IT TURNS OUT TO BE SIGNIFICANT WHEN PEOPLE SAY THIS SORT OF THING THEIR THEORY IS ALWAYS A SOMETHING OBVIOUS THAT EVERYBODY IN THE FIELD IS ALREADY AWARE OF EAST G A DIFFERENT GRAVITY LAW VARIOUS CANDIDATE PARTICLES B SOMETHING OBVIOUSLY WRONG THAT ANYBODY IN THE FIELD COULD QUICKLY DISREGARD OR C NOT REALLY EVEN SCIENCE EAST G ALL OF TIME EXISTS AT ONCE

SO THERE'S NO NEED FOR SECRECY I CAN GUARANTEE THAT YOUR THEORY IS NOT VALUABLE BUT WE CAN HELP YOU LEARN AND GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF DARK MATTER IF YOU LIKE
I WANT TO KNOW ESTIMATED CONCENTRATIONS AROUND FOR INSTANCE A SPECIFIC GALAXY CLUSTER ALONG WITH THAT GALAXY CLUSTER S MASS OF NORMAL MATTER AND ITS VELOCITY AND SO ON

YOU'RE MOSTLY LOOKING FOR INFORMATION THAT DOESN'T EXIST THERE'S A LOT OF EVIDENCE FOR THE EXISTENCE OF DARK MATTER BUT MEASURING WHERE IT IS IS VERY HARD YOU'RE LIMITED TO GRAVITATIONAL EFFECTS WHICH BASICALLY MEANS YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE DISTORTION OF LIGHT DUE TO GRAVITY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MICROLENSING THE ONLY TIME WE CAN SEE THIS IS FOR OBJECTS THE SIZE OF GALAXY CLUSTERS HERE'S AN EXAMPLE IT'S 2D AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE IMPRESSED WITH THE ACCURACY THIS IS A CONTOUR MAP OF THE BULLET GRAVITATIONAL FIELD KEEP IN MIND THERE ARE PROBABLY SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF OF GALAXY CLUSTERS THAT HAVE BEEN STUDIED THIS WAY AND THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST STUDIED AMONG THEM

IF YOU WANT TO TEST THE THEORY IN OTHER WAYS YOU HAVE MANY OPTIONS STUDYING THE MOTION OF GALAXIES IS THE MOST OBVIOUS ROTATION CURVES ARE ESSENTIALLY WHAT CONVINCED PEOPLE OF THE EXISTENCE OF DARK MATTER IN THE FIRST PLACE PEOPLE ALSO DO LARGE GRAVITATIONAL SIMULATIONS OF THE UNIVERSE TO STUDY HOW HYPOTHESIZED FORMS OF DARK MATTER RESULT OR FAIL TO RESULT IN UNIVERSES THAT LOOK LIKE OURS THE COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND HAS A WHOLE LOT OF INFORMATION THAT CAN BE LEARNED FROM IT I'M SURE THERE ARE MORE BUT I'M OUT OF IDEAS FOR NOW

LASTLY SORRY BUT NO ONES GOING TO TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY IF YOU DON'T POST YOUR THEORY HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF CAREERS HAVE GONE INTO STUDYING DARK MATTER SO IT'S UNLIKELY YOU'VE COME UP WITH SOMETHING NEW AND VIABLE SORRY TO BE BLUNT BUT THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT COME HERE WITH SIMILAR CLAIMS
ASTROWIKI IS COMPLETELY RIGHT PEOPLE IN PHYSICS SHARE IDEAS IT'S HOW WE WORK PEOPLE WORKING IN SECRECY SET OFF MOST PHYSICISTS CRACKPOT INDICATORS ALSO WHEN PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ARXIV IS IT IS USUALLY A STRONG INDICATOR THAT THEY HAVE VERY LITTLE FAMILIARITY WITH THE FIELD

THE THING ABOUT PHYSICS IS THAT IT'S SUPER WELL TESTED STANDARD IDEAS LIKE DM DESPITE NOT BEING UNDERSTOOD THOROUGHLY IS STILL VERY WELL TESTED AS MANY PEOPLE HAVE WRITTEN GOOD PAPERS COMING AT IT FROM ALL SIDES OF COURSE THERE IS STILL NEW WORK TO BE DONE BUT KNOWING WHAT IS NEW REQUIRES KNOWING WHAT IS OLD WHICH IS WHY KNOWING WHAT THE ARXIV IS IS SO IMPORTANT

AS FOR YOUR QUESTION ABOUT DM AGAIN ASTROWIKI IS RIGHT NW IS A COMMONLY USED ALTHOUGH STARTING TO SHOW ITS AGE DM DISTRIBUTION THERE IS THEN THE CORE CUSP PROBLEM THAT CAN BE HANDLED WITH AN ADDITIONAL PARAMETER FOR THE DENSITY NEAR THE EARTH THE CANONICAL VALUE IS GEV CM ALTHOUGH PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THAT NUMBER AS WELL
START HERE GOOGLE DARK MATTER DISTRIBUTION

FOLLOW THE LINKS

I CAN'T REALLY IMAGINE BEING FORCED TO DO THAT BEFORE THE FIRST YEAR AT MY SCHOOL WE WERE ACTUALLY FUNDED BY THE GRAD COLLEGE NOT THE DEPT FOR THE FIRST YRS SO THAT WE COULD EXPLORE WORK WITH PROFESSORS WITHOUT NEEDING THEM TO COMMIT TO FUNDING US OF COURSE THEY WANT A FIELD ON YOUR APPLICATION TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THIS IS NOT AN IMBALANCE IN THEIR OWN DEPARTMENT
TO MY KNOWLEDGE NONE OF THEM MAKE YOU DECIDE IN YOUR FIRST YEAR FOR ONE THING YOU GENERALLY HAVE CLASSES FOR A YEAR BEFORE THE QUALIFYING EXAMS AND FOR ANOTHER YOU GENERALLY NEED TO FIND A PROFESSOR TO EVEN START YOUR DISSERTATION RESEARCH NOW IT WOULD STILL BE NICE TO KNOW APPROXIMATELY WHAT AREA YOU WANT THAT COULD INCLUDE THEORY VS EXPERIMENT OR EVEN JUST BE HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU DON'T WANT ACCELERATOR PHYSICS YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK TWICE ABOUT CHICAGO SCHOOLS

I KNOW THEY MIGHT MAKE YOU PUT DOWN THINGS ON YOUR APPLICATIONS BUT I FIND IT HARD TO IMAGINE THAT ANY PLACE YOU GO TO WOULD MAKE YOU STICK WITH A CHOICE LIKE THAT
MS PHYSICS DOESN'T MAKE YOU DECIDE FIRST YEAR BUT YOU'RE GIVEN THE OPTION
YES RESEARCH EXPERIENCE IS GOOD LEARN EVERYTHING WORK REALLY HARD NOW
SPINTRONICS IS A PRETTY HOT FIELD DEFINITELY WORTH YOUR TIME THERE ARE A NUMBER OF LARGE OLDER COMPANIES INTERESTED INTEL IBM HP ETC AS WELL AS SOME YOUNG ONES ST TECHNOLOGIES AVALANCHE TECH NE THE TECHNOLOGY IS MATURE ENOUGH TO SEE COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS ALREADY AVAILABLE BUT NOT SO MATURE THAT ALL INTERESTING WORK IS BEING DONE IN INDUSTRY I'D SAY IT IS IN A SWEET SPOT CURRENTLY

IN ANY CASE AS AN UNDERGRAD YOU WILL FIND THE EXPERIENCE TO BE EXTREMELY USEFUL LEARNING THROUGH PHYSICAL WORK IN A LAB IS A VERY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE THAN FROM A TEXTBOOK
YES MAXIMISE EXPERIENCE HELPING IN A LAB DOESN'T COMMIT YOU TO A CAREER LOL
SO I'VE BEEN READING A REVIEW ARTICLE ON TOPOLOGICAL INSULATORS BY FRUCHART AND CARPENTIER AND I'M HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS REGARDING THE MATHEMATICAL CONSTRUCTION BEHIND THE FIBRE BUNDLE

SUPPOSE I GAVE YOU THE HAMILTONIAN H K DEFINED OVER THE BRILLOUIN ZONE LIKE IS GIVEN IN THE REVIEW HOW DO I CONSTRUCT THE FIBRE BUNDLE IN QUESTION CLEARLY THE BRILLOUIN ZONE TORUS IS THE BASE SPACE BUT WHAT ARE THE FIBERS IS IT U OR A ONE DIMENSIONAL VECTOR SACAE HOW DO I GLUE TOGETHER THESE LOCAL TRIVIALIZATION TO CONSTRUCT MY TOTAL BUNDLE

THANKS
WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF NEUTRINO PHYSICS WE KNOW THEY GOT THE NOBEL PRIZE IN BUT WHERE IS IT GOING WHAT ARE THE CURRENT DETECTORS ACCELERATORS LOOKING FOR I KNOW THEY'RE BUILDING THE ESS IN SWEDEN TOO SO WHAT'S THE PLAN

I KNOW THERE ARE THE THREE FLAVOURS WITH WHICH THE NEUTRINO CAN OSCILLATE THROUGH I'VE BEEN HEARING THINGS LIKE STERILE NEUTRINOS WITH LINKS TO DARK MATTER EVEN AND OTHER THINGS BUT NOT REALLY SURE WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR I TRIED TO FIND THINGS THROUGH NOVA FROM FERMILAB BUT THE PAPERS WERE RATHER IN DEPTH I WENT TO A TALK ON BRUNO PONTECORVO WHO WORKED A LOT ON NEUTRINO AND IT'S PIQUED MY INTEREST A LOT

THANKS FOR ANY HELP OR RELEVANT LINKS
LATELY BEEN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE CONCEPT OF A GRAVITON FITS IN WITH GRAMMAR

IN MY UNDERSTANDING GENERAL RELATIVITY SAYS THAT GRAVITY IS NOT IN FACT A FORCE BUT RATHER A CONSEQUENCE OF THE CURVATURE OF SPACETIME SO IF WE WERE ABLE TO FORMULATE A QUANTUM THEORY OF GRAVITY THAT INVOLVES THE GRAVITON AS A FORCE CARRIER FOR GRAVITY HOW WOULD THAT FIT IN WITH THE CURVED SPACETIME OF GRAVITY DOES SPACETIME ACTUALLY NOT HAVE CURVATURE AND IS IT RATHER JUST A CONVENIENT WAY TO DISCUSS GRAVITY OR IS THE FORCE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE CURVING OF SPACETIME ITSELF

THANKS
SO I'VE GOT AN EMBARRASSING QUESTION TO ASK
SAY YOU ARE TRYING TO SEPARATE TWO LIQUIDS IN A CENTRIFUGE THE CENTRIPETAL FORCE THEN ACTS UPON THESE LIQUIDS BY MY REASONING THE DENSER LIQUID SHOULD MOVE TO THE INNER PART OF THE CENTRIGURE SINCE IT HAS A HIGHER MASS AND THUS A HIGHER FORCE ACTING UPON IT F M A

I KNOW THIS IS WRONG SINCE OBVIOUSLY HEAVIER THINGS TEND TO MOVE OUTWARD IN A CENTRIFUGE BUT I HAVE NO IDEA WHY CAN SOMEBODY HERE HELP ME OUT

QUESTION I'M WORKING ON NOT QUITE SURE WHAT I'M DOING WRONG

AN OBJECT ON A LEVEL SURFACE EXPERIENCES A HORIZONTAL FORCE OF N DUE TO KINETIC FRICTION IF THE COEFFICIENT OF KINETIC FRICTION IS WHAT IS THE MASS OF THE OBJECT IN KG

USING F K NF I PLUG IN THE NUMBERS AS FOLLOWS N M I GET KG AS MY ANSWER FOR THE MASS YET THE QUESTIONNAIRE TELLS ME I'VE GOT THE WRONG ANSWER HELP
WHEN DEFINING THE CREATION OPERATOR FOR FERMIONS ON A BOCK SPACE THERE'S THIS FUNNY PHASE FACTOR COMING FROM THE TRANSFORMATION THAT DEPENDS ON HOW MANY TOTAL FERMIONS ARE IN THE STATES LABELED FROM TO I I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS NECESSARY TO OBTAIN THE RIGHT COMMUTATION RELATIONS AND THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A WAY TO ORDER THE EIGENSTATE YOU'RE WORKING WITH AND I SEE THAT YOU CAN TRANSFORM CREATION OPERATORS FROM ONE BASIS TO ANOTHER

BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR BASIS IS SAY MOMENTUM THERE'S NO WAY TO ORDER MOMENTA FOR DIMENSIONS ARE YOU FORCED TO FIRST DEFINE CREATION ANNIHILATION OPERATORS OVER A COUNTABLE EIGENBASIS AND THEN CHANGE TO THE MOMENTUM BASIS
KIND OF A BASIC QUESTION HERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT AMOUNT OF WEIGHT I'M ACTUALLY PUSHING UP DURING A PUSH-UP WEIGHT IS BASICALLY IN THE PUSH-UP POSITION I'VE DETERMINED THAT WHEN IN THE FRONT LEANING REST GIVEN A HEIGHT FROM FLOOR TO SHOULDER OF ABOUT AND A LENGTH OF FEET THE ANGLE BETWEEN THE FLOOR AND THE LINE ALONG MY BACK SHOULD BE ABOUT DEGREES TAN X

THAT BEING SAID I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO GO ABOUT CALCULATING WHAT THE FORCES ACTUALLY ARE THROUGHOUT THIS MOVEMENT BUT CURIOUS TO FIND OUT COULD ANYONE WALK ME THROUGH THIS

THANKS IN ADVANCE
HOW WAS THE FORMULA V T M L DISCOVERED FOR WAVES ON A STRING
AH HAHA WHAT AN OBVIOUS WAY TO TEST THIS HADN'T EVEN THOUGHT OF THAT BRILLIANT THANKS I'D BE CURIOUS TO FIND OUT HOW THIS WOULD BE DETERMINED THEORETICALLY BUT ALAS I DON'T WANT TO CAUSE YOU A HUGE HEADACHE IF THE PROCESS IS LESS THAN EASY
I'M NOT REALLY A PHYSICIST SO I WOULDN'T KNOW WOULD YOU AGREE THAT EVERY ACTION IS A DEFINITE THEORETICALLY PREDICTABLE REACTION TO ANOTHER ACTION EVEN ON HE QUANTUM LEVEL IF NOT WHAT ARE SOME COUNTER EXAMPLES
ANY UP TO DATE MATERIALS ON NEEDS TO BE AUGUST OR NEWER
THE MARKET HAS BEEN FLOODED BY THE US SELLING OFF ITS RESERVES SINCE WWII THE THE ONLY REASON THERE IS A SHORTAGE IS BECAUSE EXTRACTION IS NOT JUSTIFIED BY THE REDUCED PRICE CAUSED BY THE SELLOFF THERE IS MORE THAN ENOUGH HELIUM TO BE HAD ONCE THE COST OF EXTRACTING BECOMES JUSTIFIED BY ITS MARKET PRICE
WELL THIS IS CERTAINLY A MOTIVATION TO REV UP FUSION REACTOR RESEARCH THINK OF THE AMOUNT OF HELIUM YOU COULD PRODUCE

SERIOUSLY THOUGH ARE THERE ANY NATURAL SOURCES OR ARTIFICIAL MEANS OF PRODUCING HELIUM
TOOK A LOOK AT THE REPORT SEEMS LIKE ELIMINATING THE MAJOR HELIUM REQUIREMENT VOLUME THRESHOLD FOR FEDERAL GRANTEES COULD BE LOGISTICALLY PROBLEMATIC ALSO NOT SURE HOW YOU'D GO ABOUT CONVINCING VENDORS TO SELL HELIUM AT WHAT SOUNDS LIKE BELOW MARKET PRICES DO LIKE THE SUGGESTION OF SUBSIDIZING HELIUM RECLAMATION EQUIPMENT THOUGH
NEBRASKA FOOTBALL FANS RELEASE HELIUM BALLOONS EVERY TIME THEY SCORE A TOUCHDOWN QUITE DISGRACEFUL
ACCORDING TO THE REPORT ONLY PDF PAGE IS USED FOR OTHER MY QUESTION IS IF THIS IS PURELY AN ANALYSIS OF THE INDUSTRIAL SCIENTIFIC USES OR IF FRIVOLOUS HELIUM BALLOON USE IS INCLUDED IN THIS ASSESSMENT

MY INITIAL GUT REACTION WAS TO CRY FOR PITCHFORKS TOWARD FRIVOLOUS USERS BUT IF THE OTHER CATEGORY IS ALREADY THAT SMALL THEN IT'S REALLY GOVERNMENT ACADEMIC AND INDUSTRY SUPPLY AND DEMAND THAT MUST BE BETTER COORDINATED
SOMEDAY KIDS WON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE SEEING IN AN APPLE MESSAGE WITH BALLOONS
GUESS I SHOULD STOP VENTING THAT DEWAR IN THE LAB THEN
WONT ALL THE HELIUM JUST GO TO THE TOP OF OUR ATMOSPHERE I UNDERSTAND IT WILL BE WAY HARDER TO GET FROM THERE AND COST MORE TO DO BUT ITS NOT GETTING DEPLETED
THIS NEEDS TO HAPPEN ANYWAY TO REPRESENT THE ACTUAL VALUE OF HELIUM AGAIN I SAY IT ONCE THE GOVERNMENT STOPS DUMPING HELIUM AND HOPEFULLY THEY TRAIL IT OFF RATHER THAN SUDDENLY STOPPING ON THE MARKET THEN PRICES WILL RETURN TO A NATURAL LEVEL IT MAY PUT SOME USES OUT OF GENERAL USE AND ENGINEERS WILL FIND OTHER CHEMICALS OR METHODS TO DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO THIS IS EXPECTED AND NATURAL
AN INERT ELEMENT THAT LIKES TO FLOAT UP AND DISAPPEAR INTO SPACE ALSO REALLY LIKES TO ESCAPE CONTAINERS NATURE RUELY DOESN'T GIVE A FUCK
JUST LIKE HELIUM
IF IT'S NON RENEWABLE WHERE DO WE GET HELIUM
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH OF IT JUST GIVEN AWAY AT MCDONALDS
NO YOUR EDUCATION WILL NOT BE IRRELEVANT YOU WILL LEARN THE SAME STUFF MORE OR LESS I DO GET THE IMPRESSION THAT UNDERGRAD CLASSES AT UNIVERSITIES ARE A BIT MORE DETAILED AND THE HOMEWORK PERHAPS A BIT MORE RIGOROUS BUT FOR THE MOST PART THE MATERIAL IS THE SAME AT THE UNDERGRADUATE LEVEL

I WENT TO A BIG SCHOOL FOR UNDERGRAD BEFORE MOVING ON TO A SCHOOL FOR GRAD SCHOOL SO I HAVE SEEN BOTH SIDES OF THE COIN
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO GO TO A TOP SCHOOL IN ORDER TO HAVE A GOOD CAREER WORK HARD IT WILL PAY OFFICIAL
TO ECHO THE OTHER COMMENTS SURE IT WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO ATTEND A TOP SCHOOL BUT THIS IS NOT A REQUIREMENT ESPECIALLY FOR UNDERGRAD WORK HARD PRODUCE RESULTS ESPECIALLY IN GRAD SCHOOL AND WHILE IT MAY BE A BIT HARDER IT'S NOT A DEATH SENTENCE TO ATTEND A LESSER SCHOOL
ONE THING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE FAIL TO MENTION IS THAT IF YOU WANT TO DO RESEARCH AND PLAN ON GOING TO GRAD SCHOOL UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT OF YOUR APPLICATION THEREFORE A SCHOOL WITH STRONG RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES WILL DEFINITELY GIVE YOU A LEG UP IF YOU GO TO A SCHOOL WITH WEAK RESEARCH YOU COULD STILL FIND OTHER RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES THOUGH BEST BET WOULD BE AN AEU COMPETITIVE AND RESTRICTED TO THE SUMMER BUT THEY DO LIKE ACCEPTING FROM SCHOOLS WITH LOW RESEARCH OR DO RESEARCH AT ANOTHER SCHOOL THAT IS GEOGRAPHICALLY NEAR NORTHEASTERN IS CLOSE TO MIT HARVARD SO NOT A BAD CHOICE
AS OTHERS MENTIONED THE NAME PRESTIGE OF THE SCHOOL DOESN'T MATTER TOO MUCH PLENTY OF TALENTED STUDENTS WORK HARD AND DO WELL IN LESS PRESTIGIOUS SCHOOLS AND THIS REALLY PAYS OFF LATER WITH GRAD SCHOOL ADMISSIONS THE NAME OF THE SCHOOL IS IRRELEVANT

YOU SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER YOUR INSTITUTION IS AN SCHOOL WHICH MEANS THAT RESEARCH AND FUNDING IS WELL AVAILABLE TO UNDERGRADUATES HAVING YRS OF RESEARCH EXPERIENCE IN PHYSICS GIVES YOU A HUGE EDGE WHEN IT COMES TO GRAD SCHOOL ADMISSIONS ANOTHER THING TO CONSIDER HOW LARGE IS THE PHYSICS DEPARTMENT THIS IS A GOOD INDICATOR OF HOW THE DEPARTMENT'S BUDGET IS ARE THERE ONLY ABOUT PROFESSORS OR AROUND KEEP THESE IN MIND WHILE YOU'RE SEARCHING BUT TRY NOT TO BE TOO PICKY BEST OF LUCK
PRETTY MUCH BUT THAT IS A VERY EUPHEMISTIC WAY TO PUT IT

I LIKE TO THINK OF IT MORE AS SMASHING YOUR HEAD AGAINST A BRICK WALL OVER AND OVER UNTIL IT FINALLY FALLS DOWN ALLOWING YOU TO TAKE A STEP ONLY TO REVEAL ANOTHER BRICK WALL BEHIND IT
AS SOMEONE NEARING THE END OF UNDERGRAD WHO WILL EVENTUALLY BE STARTING ON THE GRAD SCHOOL PATH ARTICLES LIKE THIS ALWAYS MAKE ME A LITTLE DEPRESSED THEY REMIND ME OF WHY I LOVE PHYSICS WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY REMINDING ME THAT MY SIGNIFICANT OTHER IS TRAINING TO BE A TEACHER AND TEACHERS ARE SEVERELY PENALIZED FOR MOVING AROUND WHEREAS PHYSICISTS ARE PENALIZED FOR STAYING IN THE SAME PLACE I HAVE A LOT OF DIFFICULTY IMAGINE A WORLD WHERE WE BREAK UP OR WHERE I LEAVE PHYSICS WHICH LEAVES ME WONDERING WHAT THE HELL THE FUTURE HAS IN STORE
THIS IS WHY I AM PROBABLY GOING TO LEAVE PHYSICS I AM SMART ENOUGH AND SKILLED ENOUGH THAT I CAN PROBABLY MAKE IT I'M CURRENTLY IN MY FIRST POST DOC AND IF I WORKED HARD COULD GET A SECOND

BUT I'M NOT EMOTIONALLY STRONG ENOUGH I AM NOT ABLE TO FEEL SHITTY ABOUT MY WORK FOR MONTHS AT A TIME ONLY TO FINALLY DO SOMETHING

I FEEL LIKE IF I LEFT FOR INDUSTRY I WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE SMALL VICTORIES ON A MONTHLY OR WEEKLY BASIS EVEN IF THE WORK ITSELF IS LESS INTELLECTUALLY SATISFYING IT WILL BE MORE EMOTIONALLY SATISFYING

IT SOMETIMES SEEMS THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO REALLY ARE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS FIELD ARE EITHER EMOTIONALLY VOID ROBOTS OR WORKAHOLICS WHO SOMEHOW GET SATISFACTION FROM BANGING THEIR HEAD ON THE WALL JUST BECAUSE THEY WORKED THROUGH THE WEEKEND AND THAT IS SOME INTRINSIC GOOD TO NEGLECT FAMILY AND FRIENDS
EPIPHANY HERESY NOVELTY INGENUITY INDUSTRY UBIQUITY
THE DECADE OR SO SPENT IN JOBS AND MOVING FROM PLACE TO PLACE THE IMPORTANCE OF ACADEMIC PEDIGREE AND PERSONAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GETTING AHEAD AND THE ULTIMATELY VERY LOW CHANCE OF LANDING A PERMANENT POSITION ALL CONTRIBUTE TO A DEPLORABLE LACK OF WOMEN AND ETHNIC MINORITIES IN THE FIELD THIS IS APART FROM THE USUAL OVERT OR COVERT BIASES THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO BREAK INTO THE OLD BOYS CLUB I SINCERELY HOPE THAT WE CAN OVERCOME THESE INSTITUTIONAL BARRIERS


OH THE GUARDIAN WHY DID I EXPECT THIS NOT TO HAVE SOME RETARDED BIAS BEHIND IT IT'S THE GUARDIAN THERE JUST HAS TO BE AT LEAST A TINY BIT OF CONSPIRACY CONJECTURE THAT THE TOPIC IS MISOGYNISTIC AND OR RACIST BECAUSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE GUARDIAN TO PUBLISH ANYTHING THAT DOESN'T SPREAD THE DOGMA OF RELIGIOUS FEMINISM JUST WHAT THE FUCK IT'S ALMOST HILARIOUS HOW FORCED THE SW NONSENSE WAS IN THE ARTICLE


IT'S AS IF THEY WRITE REASONABLE ARTICLES BUT THEN BEFORE PUBLISHING THEY HAVE TO GIVE THEM TO FEMINIST CENSORS WHO ADD IN OR REMOVE THINGS TO INJECT THE DOGMA
I HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH A BOOK THE CLOSEST IS LIKELY FUNDAMENTALS OF SEMICONDUCTOR PHYSICS BY YU AND CARDONA

DP REF IE DTF QID SR KEYWORDS FUNDAMENTALS OF SEMICONDUCTOR PHYSICS CARDONA

IT HAS AN EXTREMELY DETAILED CHAPTER ON GROUP THEORY AS IT RELATES TO CRYSTAL STRUCTURE TRANSPORT AND SELECTION RULES IT DOES HOWEVER GO INTO THE EXTREME NITTY GRITTY SO IT IS AIMED AT SEMICONDUCTOR PHYSICISTS AND DOES VERY LITTLE HAND WAVING AND HAS PROBLEMS FOR PRACTICE SO IT IS PERHAPS A MIDDLE GROUND SOLUTION

IT CALLS THE SECTION A PEDESTRIAN'S GUIDE TO GROUP THEORY I'LL LET YOU BE THE JUDGE IF IT TRULY IS
I'M SURE I'LL GET TOLD TO GTO B GROUP THEORETICAL ANALYSIS IS ROUTINE IN SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY SO FOR AN DIRTY INTRODUCTION LIKELY YOUR BEST BET WILL BE SOME KIND OF VIBRATIONAL SPECTROSCOPY TEXTBOOK AIMED SQUARELY AT CHEMISTS

GOOD EXAMPLES ARE MOLECULAR VIBRATIONS FOR GASES AND SOLIDS TREATED VIA THE ATOMS IN A NEIGHBOUR POTENTIAL APPROACH DECIUS AND MOLECULAR VIBRATIONS IN CRYSTALS OR VIBRATIONAL SPECTROSCOPY OF SOLIDS

KAXIRAS HAS A GOOD BOOK ON SOLID STATE PHYSICS AIMED SQUARELY ST MATERIAL SCIENTISTS THAT MAY BE WORTH A LOOK TOO
THE STANDARD ONE I'VE SEEN ARE


SYMMETRY PRINCIPLES IN SOLID STATE AND MOLECULAR PHYSICS BY MELVIN LAX

GROUP THEORY AND QUANTUM MECHANICS MICHAEL TINKHAM


I ALSO AGREE WITH U FEELLIKEAFAPGOD IN THAT READING BOOKS WOULD BE A VERY PRACTICAL WAY TO GET STARTED
DELETED
STRESS TENSOR OF A NEWTONIAN FLUID IS
IJ DELTA IJ P RHO ETA DELTA IJ DIVISION V ZETA DELTA IJ DIVISION V

SO IF WE HAVE AN WAVE THEN P E I K X AND E I K X AND

XX P RHO 2 ETA ZETA DX
ZZ P ZETA ETA DX

THE DIFFERENCES ARE DO TO THE CONVECTIVE TERM RHO 2 AND THE VISCOSITY TERMS



THE STRESS TENSOR FOR A FLUID WITHOUT THE WAVE IS DIAG I P P P WHERE I IS THE DENSITY AND P THE PRESSURE SO I'M NOT SURE WHY YOU THINK THE YY AND ZZ COMPONENTS SHOULD BE ZERO WHEN THERE'S A WAVE
HAHA WON'T WORK HIGH QUALITY MASS SPECS ARE STILL LARGE INSTRUMENTS AND THE DATA YOU COLLECT WOULD ONLY BE ONE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE TOWARDS IDENTIFICATION
IF YOU WERE LOOKING FOR SPECIFIC CHEMICALS IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO CREATE A CUP THAT WILL CHANGE COLOR DUE TO A REACTION WITH THAT CHEMICAL OR CREATE A TABLET THAT WILL REACT IN A CERTAIN WAY WITH WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR

IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE THAT SOMETHING LIKE CERTAIN DRUGS IN A DRINK WILL ABSORB A CERTAIN WAVELENGTH OF LIGHT THAT YOU CAN BUY AS AN LED THEN YOU COULD BUILD A SIMPLE DETECTOR TRY TO FIND SPECTRA FOR THE CHEMICALS YOU ARE INTERESTED IN
A MASS SPEC REQUIRES A PRETTY BIG MAGNET SOME WAY OF ACCELERATING IONIZED PARTICLES TO A KNOWN ENERGY AND A DETECTOR TO PICK UP THE SPREAD SO WE CAN CALCULATE RELATIVE MASSES

UNFORTUNATELY THESE THINGS ARE LARGER THAN A CUP
I LOVE THIS GUY HIS LECTURES REALLY HELPED ME THROUGH PHYSICS 2
THIS SEEMS A GOOD AND COMPLETE PHYSICS COURSE FOR BEGINNERS TO TAKE BEFORE AND OTHER MORE ADVANCED COURSES TO BAD THERE IS NO BOOK YET FOR THE NEXT PART PHYS
WHY OF THE VOTES IT'S A FREE PHYSICS COURSE

EDIT OK LINK TO DOWNLOAD THE NOTES IT'S NOT WORKING
WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS

GENERALLY NEGATIVE AT LEAST THEY WERE THE LAST TIME SOMEONE ASKED


I DON'T THINK THE OPINIONS HAVE CHANGED MUCH IN THE LAST YEAR BUT WE'RE HOSTING THE THREAD JUST IN CASE SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE ADDED
YOURS IS TOUGH TO TOP BUT HOW ABOUT I'M GOOD AT PHYSICS BUT BAD AT MATHEMATICS
QUANTUM CONSCIOUSNESS
TIDE GOES IN TIDE GOES OUT YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN THAT
NUMBERS WITHOUT UNITS

MEASURED NUMBERS WITHOUT UNCERTAINTIES

EQUATIONS WHICH ARE DIMENSIONALLY INCONSISTENT

USING THETA FOR THE AZIMUTHAL ANGLE AND PHI FOR THE POLAR ANGLE

R
IT'S TRIVIAL TO SHOW THAT THE PROOF IS LEFT AS AN EXERCISE TO THE READER
WHAT ARE THE PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS OF THAT

GOD PARTICLE

PLEASE TELL ME WHAT YOU DO BUT KNOW BEFOREHAND THAT I HAVE RESOLVED TO NOT UNDERSTAND IT YES THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENS NOT IN THOSE WORDS


WHEN MY LAB INSTRUCTOR COMES OVER LOOKS AT MY NUMBERS AND SAYS IN A DRY VOICE

IT APPEARS YOU'VE MADE A DISCOVERY
IT'S JUST A THEORY
WHAT THE F IS MEDICAL PHYSICS THAT SOUNDS SO USELESS

EVERY TIME I SWEAR TO GOD
ACTUALLY IT'S CENTRIPETAL
WE'RE OUT OF COFFEE
THE BEST THREADS IN R PHYSICS ARE STOLEN FROM R MATH BECAUSE PHYSICISTS CAN'T DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN RIP OFF MATHEMATICIANS
I HAVE AN IDEA FOR A PERPETUAL MOTION MACHINE
IT'S LIGHTYEARS FROM NOW
PHYSICS IS FINE IN A LAB BUT THIS IS THE REAL WORLD
JUST REPEAT ANY SENTENCE DEEPAK CHOPRA HAS EVER SAID
EVOLUTION CAN'T BE REAL BECAUSE ENTROPY SAYS THINGS GO FROM ORDER TO DISORDER NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND
I LOVE THE IMPERIAL SYSTEM
OOOO LIKE GRAVITY AND STUFF WHAT'S SO COMPLICATED ABOUT THAT IT'S JUST THINGS GO UP THEN DOWN

PS I'M SO SORRY
ENTROPY ISN'T REAL SCIENCE YOU DON'T KNOW DISORDER WILL INCREASE
SO ARE YOU A PHYSICIAN YET
NEIL DEGRASSI TYSON IS THE ALBERT EINSTEIN OF MODERN PHYSICS
GOD PARTICLE GODDAMN

I HAVE WATCHED THIS YOUTUBE VIDEO ANY STATEMENT ABOUT PHYSICS

IF YOU GO FAST YOUR MASS INCREASES WITH THE OPTIONAL AND YOU BECOME A BLACK HOLE
YOU'VE GOT A SIGN ERROR
ARE YOU WILLING TO ACCEPT THE BENEFITS OF TACHYON ENERGY HEALING HETP INTO YOUR LIFE

PLEASE GIVE US YOUR MONEY
I HAVE A THEORY THAT X IS ACTUALLY Y FOR ALMOST ANY VALUES OF X AND Y

I'VE SUFFERED THROUGH THIS FOR INANE VALUES SUCH AS I HAVE A THEORY THAT DIAGONAL IS ACTUALLY ANOTHER DIMENSION OR I HAVE A THEORY THAT STARS ARE ACTUALLY ALIVE
I STUDY ASTROLOGY TOO
HIGH RATE OF SPEED
DO YOU EVEN DO ANYTHING AROUND HERE

REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOUR JOB IS IF YOU'RE PROUD OF WHAT YOU DO THAT HURTS
PLEASE SOLVE THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS IN GOLDSTEIN

MAYBE MORE DEPRESSED DREAD THAN PISSED OFF THOUGH
RENORMALIZATION IS MATHEMATICAL WITCHCRAFT AND SHOULD NOT BE USED IN SERIOUS PROOFS
SCIENCE PROVES THAT

NOT HOW SCIENCE WORKS
SO YOUR LOVE LIFE
ANYTHING ABOUT AN ELECTRON PHYSICALLY SPINNING IT GIVES MY ADVISOR A HEART ATTACK HE WAS STUDENT TOO
F WHAT AGAIN
SENTENCE HOW ABOUT PHRASES OR EVEN WORDS

LARGE ANGLE

NONLINEAR



RIGOROUS PROOF

NO YOU CAN'T USE MATHEMATIC
HOW DO YOU KNOW FOR SURE ALL YOU KNOW ARE THEORIES
HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT LIQUID GRAVITY
ISN'T IT PRONOUNCED
IS THIS JUST A THREAD FOR PHYSICISTS TO OPENLY DISPLAY SMUGNESS BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE PHYSICISTS LOVE ANY OPPORTUNITY TO BE SMUG
SO YOU'RE LIKE SHELDON ON THE BIG BANG THEORY

MY GRANDMA SAID THAT ONCE

THE RESULTING GLARE ENSURED THAT SHE'LL NEVER SAY IT AGAIN
THE SUN TRAVELS AROUND THE EARTH IN A STRAIGHT LINE

YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN WHY GOD MADE STUFF THE WAY HE DID

PHYSICS ISN'T SCIENCE
ENERGY CAN'T BE DESTROYED SO YOUR SOUL MUST LIVE ON AFTER DEATH BECAUSE YOUR LIFE ENERGY HAS TO GO SOMEWHERE PHYSICS HAS PROVEN IT


QUANTUM MECHANICS IS OUTDATED NOW ISN'T IT
TACHYON VIBRATIONS
GOD DOES NOT PLAY DICE

THIS GETS UNDER MY SKIN ALL THE TIME
SO I HAVE THIS NEAT DESIGN FOR A COLD FUSION REACTOR
IT'S JUST A THEORY
WHAT ABOUT QUANTUM EFFECTS
DARK MATTER IS INCREDIBLY SILLY ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS ADJUST GRAVITY A LITTLE

MANY WORLDS IS THE ONLY SENSIBLE INTERPRETATION OF QUANTUM MECHANICS
YES BUT WHAT IS THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION
WHAT'S QUANTUM MECHANICS AND HOW DO I TEACH MY YEAR OLD DAUGHTER ABOUT IT

ACTUAL CONVERSATION TODAY
A PARTICLE CAN BE IN TWO PLACES AT THE SAME TIME
YOUR MASS IS LARGER WHEN YOU ARE RUNNING YES IT REALLY IS BECAUSE RELATIVITY
USING THE TERM QUANTUM PHYSICS TO DESCRIBE BASICALLY ANYTHING MORE COMPLEX THAN HIGH SCHOOL PHYSICS
TIME DOES NOT EXIST
YEAH I KNOW ALL ABOUT PHYSICS I'VE WATCHED EVERY EPISODE OF BIG BANG THEORY OR SO JUST LIKE BIG BANG THEORY
OH SO YOU'RE AN ASTROLOGIST
THE EARTH TRAVELS AROUND THE SUN IN A HELICAL VORTEX MOTION THAT'S WHY THE UNIVERSAL ENERGY IS LINKED TO YOUR DNA AT THE QUANTUM LEVEL
REMINDS ME OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE APSA AT MY GRAD SCHOOL SAID AT THE START OF HER ADDRESS TO THE NEW PHYSICS GRAD STUDENTS WOW I FEEL LIKE I'M ON THE BIG BANG THEORY NOT A GOOD START
I HAAAATE WHEN PEOPLE OPEN A CONVERSATION WITH SOMETHING LIKE DO YOU WATCH THE BIG BANG THEORY I LOVE THAT SHOW PART OF ME FEELS BAD BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO RELATE AND HAVE A FRIENDLY CONVERSATION BUT IT'S JUST A REALLY FUCKING SHITTY SHOW EVEN IGNORING THE PHYSICS ASPECTS OF IT
YOU KNOW THERE REALLY ISN'T ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SPEED AND VELOCITY RIGHT
INSERT HERE WHATEVER
JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS BACK SOME WOMAN ON SUNDAY MORNING LIVE PROGRAMME ON THE BBC AND SAID THAT QUANTUM PHYSICS HAS PROVED THE AFTERLIFE IS REAL BECAUSE STUDIES BY EXPERTS HAVE SHOWN IT TO BE

I WAS FRANKLY QUITE ASTONISHED AND MIND BLOWN WHY DID MY PROFESSORS KEEP THIS FROM ME WHEN I WAS STUDYING QUANTUM PHYSICS I WAS ONLY TAUGHT EIGENFUNCTION OPERATORS COMMUTATOR ETC NOT THE AFTERLIFE
GRAVITY IS JUST A THEORY RIGHT
THE PROOF IS LEFT AS AN EXERCISE TO THE READER
2
THIS DEVELOPMENT REPRESENTS A QUANTUM LEAP IN TERMS OF INDUSTRY GROWTH
QUANTUM ENERGY GENERATOR
PROJECTS
IN THIS CLASS WE USE THE MOSTLY NEGATIVE METRIC
IN AETHER WAVE THEORY
PHYSICS ARE SUBJECTIVE
FOR THAT REASON I TURN TO YOU BECAUSE I WANT TO REPORT A CRIME SERIES WHICH HAPPENED AND HAPPENING IN THESE DAYS ALSO IN THE PHYSICS NOBEL COMMITTEE AND THE WHOLE PHYSICS COMMUNITY
OH YOU STUDY PHYSICS YOU SURELY WATCH BIG BANG THEORY
I MUST SAY THAT THE EARTH IS FLAT
YOU MUST BE GREAT AT MATH
I AM DECELERATING TO A STOP
AND NOBODY MENTIONED FREE ENERGY YET
I MADE THIS PLOT NAH NO NEED TO LABEL THE AXIS ITS OBVIOUS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE
WHAT IS A FIELD
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO ACTUALLY GET A JOB WITH THAT DEGREE
BUT IT'S JUST A THEORY
PEOPLE THOUGHT EINSTEIN WAS CRAZY

EINSTEIN WAS BAD AT MATH
X P
WHAT USE IS PHYSICS ANYWAY
HOMEOPATHY MAKES SENSE
SO YOU'RE LIKE HOWARD OR KUTHRAPALI ON BIG BANG THEORY
QUANTUM PHYSICISTS NEED TO LEARN BASIC LOGIC
PERPETUAL ENERGY MOTION MACHINES

USUALLY SOME GUY WITH WISHFUL THINKING AND MAGNETS LOTS OF MAGNETS
I'VE ACTUALLY HEARD THIS ONE
I'VE HEARD THEY'RE BUILDING A GIANT SPACESHIP UNDER THE LOC YOU ARE FROM PHYSICS YOU MUST IT IS TRUE ISN'T IT
I THINK I'M CHEATING WITH THIS BUT PRETTY MUCH EVERY SENTENCE IN THIS VIDEO
SO YOU STUDY ASTROPHYSICS WHAT'S YOUR SIGN
I ONCE READ A BOOK ABOUT AND I COULDNT PUT IT DOWN
THERE IS NO GRAVITY IN SPACE
THOSE EQUATIONS LIKE

E T 2 Z V

WHERE E IS THE ENERGY T THE TEMPERATURE V THE SPEED B THE MAGNETIC FIELD AND Z IS NOWHERE DEFINED

CENTRIFUGAL FORCE IS REAL

2 CENTRIFUGAL FORCE ISN'T REAL
K
IS TOPIC
WHAT IS ENERGY
I DON'T THINK THEY CAN REALLY TALK TO THE DEAD
AS AN ASTROPHYSICIST ANYTHING ABOUT TNT
MY FAVORITE THING TO LINK TO MY COLLEAGUES
THEORIES
THE EARTH IS FLAT I'VE SEEN THE PROOF
ASTROPHYSICS UNDERGRAD HERE YEAH OH LIKE SHELDON EVERY FUCKING TIME
PRACTICAL FUSION REACTORS ARE TEN YEARS AWAY
I'VE MADE A PERPETUAL MOTION MACHINE THAT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO TAKE A LOOK
HERE IS A GOLDMINE TO DRIVE THEM BONKERS

HOME BAEZ


THE EARTH IS FLAT AND WE HAVE NEVER BEEN TO SPACE LOOK AT THIS PICTURE
IMAGE PRIVATE SAMYIPS
THAT DOESNT LOOK LIKE IT'S GOING TO SPACE TO ME
THIS WAS NOT MADE UP SOMEONE ACTUALLY SAID THIS

WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS NEW FREE ENERGY MACHINE
IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO TAP YOUR BRAKES AND ADJUST YOUR SEAT AT THE SAME TIME
IT WAS A QUANTUM LEAP
BIOLOGY IS BETTER THAN PHYSICS
DARK MATTER DOESN'T EXIST

TO WHICH I ALWAYS REPLY OK SO HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE THIRD ACOUSTIC PEAK IN THE CB POWER SPECTRUM

IF THEIR ANSWER IS WUT I DON'T BOTHER WASTING MY TIME
HEAT RISES

ONE OF MY OLD PHYSICS TEACHERS ACTUALLY SENT A GIRL OUT OF CLASS FOR SAYING THAT
THE EARTH IS FLAT
SO WHERE DOES PHYSICS ACTUALLY GET YOU IN LIFE
THE EARTH IS FLAT
PHYSICS IS EASY IF YOU KNOW MATHEMATICS
I'M STUDYING CIRCULAR MOTION CURRENTLY IN MECHANICS AND WHEN I REFERRED TO ANGULAR VELOCITY OMEGA AS W THE SWEETEST TEACHER IN THE WORLD LOOKED AND WENT NUMBER OMEGA NOT WEST STOP IT'S NOT A WEST AND THEN PROCEEDED TO EXPLAIN THIS TO THE ENTIRE CLASS IN THE MIDDLE OF AN EVALUATION EXERCISE
PSI F


AND THE WORST OF ALL
FT S
GRAVITY THE BIG BANG AND EVOLUTION ARE THEORIES
DID YOU KNOW MARS WILL BE THE SIZE OF THE MOON TONIGHT THE ONLY CHANCE TO SEE THAT IN YOUR LIFETIME

IF I HEAR THIS ONCE MORE DEEP BREATH
BUT ISN'T PHYSICS JUST APPLIED MATH
I DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME TO PUT UNITS IN THIS PLOT AXES
OH YOU'RE A PHYSICIST WHAT AM I THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW
LISTEN TO THIS INTERESTING THEORY OF BLANK I'VE BEEN MULLING OVER
DARK MATTER IS A THEORY INVOKING INVISIBLE MATTER TO SOLVE GRAVITATIONAL ANOMALIES IS INELEGANT FLAWED WHAT HAVE YOU OFTEN PAIRED WITH THE ANECDOTE ABOUT HOW THAT FAILED FOR ANOMALOUS ORBIT

COMPLETELY IGNORING THAT THAT'S EXACTLY HOW NEPTUNE WAS DISCOVERED OF COURSE AND IGNORING THE LITANY OF COSMOLOGICAL EVIDENCE FOR DARK MATTER
GOD DID IT
FORTRAN IS OUT OF DATE
COMPREHENSIVE EXAM
PHYSICISTS ARE WHORES

LOOKING AT THE REST OF THE COMMENTS APPARENTLY I'M DOING IT WRONG BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT MY THEORY WOULD WORK OUT IF TESTED
ASTRONOMY AND ASTROLOGY ARE THE SAME THING TEEPEE
THE UNIVERSE IS ONLY YEARS OLD AND WAS CREATED IN DAYS
AETHER WAVE THEORY
NUCULA
IF YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN IT TO MY GRANDMOTHER YOU HAVEN'T REALLY UNDERSTOOD IT


HIGGS BOSON OH YOU MEANT THE GOD PARTICLE
A BIG ACHIEVEMENT IS A QUANTUM JUMP
I JUST THINK IT'S ARROGANT TO SAY THAT WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN SPACE A BILLION LIGHT YEARS AWAY BASED ON WHAT WE SEE HERE ON EARTH

FACEPALM
YEAH BUT YOU KNOW PHYSICS IS JUST THEORETICAL IT'S NOT ACTUALLY REAL

HAD THIS SAID TO ME BY A GIRL IN CLUB SHE IS APPARENTLY STUDYING A PHD IN BIOLOGY
THE NORMAL FORCE IS COUNTER FORCE
YOU KNOW WE ARE ALL JUST WAVES DUE TO THE THE MEAT OF A DEAD ANIMAL HAS A BAD FREQUENCY BECAUSE IT WAS KILLED SO IF YOU EAT MEAT THOSE BAD FREQUENCIES INTERFERE WITH THE ONES FROM YOUR BODY IN A WAY THAT MAKES YOU FEEL BAD THEREFORE YOU SHOULD BE VEGETARIAN MY VEGETARIAN ROOMMATE
ALWAYS TWENTY YEARS AWAY AWAY AWAY AWAY
THIS CAME UP AT A JOB INTERVIEW REAL PHYSICISTS DON'T WRITE CODE

NEEDLESS TO SAY HE DIDN'T GET THE JOB
A SMALL BLOCKHOLE WOULD SUCK IN OUR ENTIRE UNIVERSE

WATCH V ZPVD
LITERALLY ANYTHING ABOUT GOING BACK IN TIME WHEN PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT THE ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLY TECHNOLOGY SURROUNDING THEM AS BEING TOO DIFFICULT TO USE PRETTY MUCH ANY TIME PEOPLE START TALKING ABOUT QUANTUM AND CONNECTING IT TO SCIENCE FICTION PERHAPS THE MOST FRUSTRATING THING IS WHEN MY ROOMMATE COMPLAINS ABOUT USING EXCEL FOR HIS BUSINESS CLASSICAL I LIVED WITH MUSIC MAJORS IN COLLEGE AND SOME OF THE STUFF THEY WOULD SAY JEBUS
YOU REALLY SHOULD WATCH WHAT THE BLEEP DO WE KNOW IF YOU LIKE PHYSICS
THE SQUARE ROOT OF TWO IS NOT ONE

HAPPENED WAY TOO MANY TIMES AFTER HOURS OF ACTIVELY WORKING ON A PROBLEM IN A GROUP AND FINALLY GETTING STUCK TO THE POINT OF NO RETURN ONLY TO HAVE THE PROFESSOR POINT OUT THE MISTAKE IN THE BEGINNING OF OUR WORK
SPEED AND VELOCITY ARE THE SAME THING
PHYSICS IS JUST MATHS APPLIED POORLY
QUANTUM LEAP WHEN REFERRING TO A BIG CHANGE WHEN IN REALITY IT'S THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE CHANGE ALTHOUGH OF COURSE IT DOES NOT BEAT ANY REFERENCE TO BIG BANG THEORY
TELLING MY PHYSICS TEACHER THAT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND PHYSICS THAT PISSED HIM OFF IN AN EPIC WAY
HOW DO MAGNETS WORK

THANK GOD
CALLING ATOMS AND OTHER PARTICLES MICROSCOPIC ALWAYS IRKS ME
GRAVITY IS JUST A THEORY
DURING STAR WARS THINGS LIKE WE'RE TRAVELLING AT LIGHT SPEED NOW
WHILE TRYING TO EXPLAIN SCHROEDINGER CAT

SO THE CAT IS EITHER ALIVE OR DEAD BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHICH UNTIL WE OPEN THE BOX
HAVE YOU READ THE SECRET
ALL IT IS IS APPLIED MATH
PHYSICS MATHEMATICS

EDIT GIVEN THAT THIS IS A PHYSICS SUBREDDIT DOWNVOTES JUST PROVE THAT IT SERVES ITS PURPOSE
LAZER LIGHT
UNVERIFIABLE FALSIFIABILITY
THE BIG BANG COULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED BECAUSE EXPLOSIONS ONLY DESTROY THINGS THAT'S LIKE BLOWING UP A CHUNK OF METAL AND HAVING A WATCH COME OUT MY DIETICIAN FRIEND
CORRELATION DOES NOT IMPLY CAUSATION
THE UNIVERSE IS INFINITE
MPH

DONT BE SMUG AND ARROGANT

EDUCATE AND EXPLAIN
ALMOST EVERY QUESTION EVER POSTED IN R ASKSCIENCE
DELETED
EFFECT
BELL'S THEOREM
LEARNING HOW TO USE RENORMALIZATION TO DO CALCULATIONS MADE ME FEEL LIKE THE PREVIOUSLY ROCK SOLID GROUND HAD DISAPPEARED FROM UNDER MY FEET
THE DELAYED CHOICE QUANTUM ERASER EXPERIMENT
THEOREM IS PRETTY COOL NOT QUITE BUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SYMMETRIES AND CONSERVATION LAWS ISN'T AN ENTIRELY OBVIOUS FACT AT FIRST
AS AN UNDERGRADUATE A CONCEPT THAT STILL BUGS ME UNCONTROLLABLY IS HOW LIGHT MINIMIZES THE TIME IT TAKES TO TRAVEL BETWEEN TWO POINTS IN DISTINCT MEDIUMS I HAVEN'T REACHED THE QUANTUM MECHANICAL KNOWLEDGE TO HAVE A EXPLANATION THIS HAS ALWAYS BAFFLED ME BEING THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEA TO DERIVE LAW
THE SCALE OF THE UNIVERSE I READ A DESCRIPTION ONCE OF HOW FAR OUT THE SUNS HOLDS INFLUENCE THROUGH GRAVITY AMD STELLAR WINDS WAY BEYOND WHERE ITS HEAT REACHES AND THATS JUST A DOT WITHIN A DOT WITHIN A DOT OF THE LOCAL CLUSTER
THAT MATTER IS MADE UP OF ATOMS AND YET ATOMS ARE PRIMARILY EMPTY SPACE
ENTANGLEMENT SWAPPING MATHEMATICALLY SIMPLE BUT THE IMPLICATION IS ABSOLUTELY FOR ME
THERE EXIST MULTIPLE THINGS IN THE UNIVERSE WHICH DO NOT OBEY OUR LAWS OF LOGIC OUR MINDS EVOLVED ONLY TO MAKE SENSE OF THE WORLD AROUND US AND THINGS LIKE QUANTUM MECHANICS THE DEFINITION OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE ANSWER TO WHY SOMETHING NOT NOTHING WILL NEVER MAKE SENSE BECAUSE HUMAN LOGIC IS NOT UNIVERSALLY APPLICABLE
SO I WATCHED A VIDEO ABOUT IT LINK WHICH REALLY HELPED ME OUT

MY ADVICE FORGET EVERYTHING YOU JUST WATCHED

A LOT OF SCIENCE POPULARIZER IN AN ATTEMPT TO BE HELPFUL DRAW ARTIFICIALLY RIGID DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN LAW THEORY HYPOTHESIS AND SO ON I GET THE IMPRESSION THAT THIS TREND COMES FROM PEOPLE WHO ARGUE CREATIONIST AND WANTED AN EASY WAY TO DEFEAT EVOLUTION IS JUST A THEORY TYPES IF THEORY IS TO REPRESENT A BODY OF WORK SUBSTANTIATED BY BLAH BLAH BLAH THEN YOU CAN JUST SHUT DOWN THE OBJECTION WITH AN ARGUMENT BY SEMANTICS

OF COURSE THINGS ARE NOT SO SIMPLE FIRST SUCH AN ARGUMENT IS EXTREMELY WEAK THE CORRECT RESPONSE WHEN PEOPLE ATTACK EVOLUTION AS JUST A THEORY IS TO POINT OUT THE EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF THE THEORY NOT TO FUSS ABOUT THE MEANING OF THE WORD IN THE FIRST PLACE IF ONE OBJECTS THAT SCIENCE NEOPHYTES MIGHT NOT KNOW THE EVIDENCE FOR EVOLUTION IN DETAIL THEN THEY HAVE NO BUSINESS DEBATING IT IN THE FIRST PLACE I CAN'T SAY I SUPPORT THIS EFFORT IT SMACKS TOO MUCH OF CREATING AN ARMY OF UNTHINKING DRONES TO ACT AS POLITICAL CANNON FODDER AND IT JUST RUBS ME THE WRONG WAY NO MATTER HOW OBJECTIVELY RIGHT THE CAUSE IS

WITH THAT OUT OF THE WAY I'LL REBUKE A FEW SPECIFIC POINTS IN THE VIDEO SINCE I THINK IT IS BOTH CONDESCENDING AND WRONG

WORDS LIKE FACT THEORY HYPOTHESIS AND LAW MEAN SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT TO A SCIENTIST THAN THEY'RE USED IN EVERYDAY SPEECH

NOT REALLY THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE TIME WHEN A SCIENTIST SAYS SOMETHING IS A FACT OR A HYPOTHESIS IT MEANS JUST WHAT YOU'D EXPECT HE SAYS FACTS ARE OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE WORLD AROUND US AND WE OBSERVE THINGS EVERY DAY LIKE THAT IT'S BRIGHT OUTSIDE WELL THAT'S EXACTLY HOW MOST PEOPLE USE THE WORD ISN'T IT NO NEED TO FURTHER THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN SCIENTISTS AND THE PUBLIC BY PRETENDING WE HAVE OUR OWN IVORY TOWER APPROVED VERSIONS OF A COMMON WORD SUCH AS FACT THAT ARE MUCH BETTER THAN YOUR PEASANT FACTS YES SIR

HYPOTHESIS WELL I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS WORD BE USED IN ANYTHING OTHER THAN SCIENTIFIC CONTEXTS AND THERE IT ALWAYS MEANS THE SAME THING

MOVING ON THE BIG PROBLEM WITH THIS WHOLE SHEBANG APPEARS A THEORY IS A A WELL SUBSTANTIATED EXPLANATION ACQUIRED THROUGH THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD AND REPEATEDLY TESTED AND CONFIRMED THROUGH OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENTATION WELL IS IT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME THINGS THAT SCIENTISTS CALL THEORIES AND SEE IF THEY FIT THIS PARADIGM

THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION DOES SEEM TO FIT THE PARADIGM UNSURPRISING SINCE IT'S THE ONE THE DEFINITION WAS TAILOR MADE TO FIT CHECK
THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY DOES SEEM TO FIT THE PARADIGM CHECK
GROUP THEORY IS AN ABSTRACT PIECE OF MATHEMATICS THAT HAS AMPLE APPLICATION IN PHYSICS IT MUCH LIKE NEARLY EVERYTHING THAT GETS THE NAME THEORY IN MATHEMATICS DOES NOT FIT THE ABOVE PARADIGM IT ALREADY HINTS THAT THERE'S MORE TO THIS THEORY BUSINESS THAN YOU'VE BEEN TOLD
DENSITY FUNCTIONAL THEORY IS A COMPUTATIONAL TOOL OFTEN USED BY NUCLEAR PHYSICISTS IT'S NOT A THEORY IN THE ABOVE SENSE
STRING THEORY HAS NEVER BEEN TESTED MUCH LESS CONFIRMED AND IT MAY NEVER BE WHETHER IT WAS ACQUIRED THROUGH THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD IS A MATTER OF NOT VERY USEFUL DEBATE
PHI FOURTH THEORY IS A FICTIONAL TOY MODEL USED TO TEACH PARTICLE PHYSICS IT NOT EVEN MEANT TO REPRESENT REALITY AND SO IT'S POINTLESS TO TESTAMENT
BY THE WAY FIELD THEORY IS A GENERAL FRAMEWORK TO BUILD PARTICLE PHYSICS MODELS AND IS NOT A THEORY IN THE ABOVE SENSE AS A MATTER OF FACT NEARLY EVERYTHING THAT PARTICLE PHYSICISTS CALL THEORIES SUCH AS THEORY THEORY THEORY AND SO ON REFER SIMPLY TO OBJECTS CONSTRUCTED IN THE FIELD THEORY PARADIGM THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEORIES TO A PARTICLE PHYSICIST ARE NOT EVEN MEANT TO REPRESENT REALITY JUST LIKE THE TOY THEORY
LATTICE FIELD THEORY IS A COMPUTATIONAL TOOL FOR DOING FIELD THEORY CALCULATIONS WHETHER OR NOT THE FIELD THEORY IN QUESTION IS SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT REALITY OR NOT IS ENTIRELY UP TO THE RESEARCHER IN QUESTION
INFLATION IN COSMOLOGY OFTEN GETS CALLED A THEORY DESPITE THE FACT THAT NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THE HELL IT IS OR HOW IT HAPPENED AND THERE'S LITTLE HOPE OF EVER ACTUALLY FINDING OUT
CHAOS THEORY VERY DEAR TO NONLINEAR DYNAMICS PEOPLE IS AGAIN MORE OF A BRANCH OF MATHEMATICS OF THE STUDY OF CERTAIN TYPES OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS THAN A MODEL OF MUCH OF ANYTHING
THE THEORY OF BLACKBODY RADIATION WAS NEVER EXPERIMENTALLY CONFIRMED AND IT COULD NEVER BE SINCE IT PREDICTED AN ABSURD RESULT KNOWN AS THE ULTRAVIOLET CATASTROPHE THAT LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF QUANTUM MECHANICS
THE MIASMA THEORY OF DISEASE NEVER PASSED RIGOROUS SCIENTIFIC TESTS NOR WAS IT DISCOVERED THROUGH SCIENTIFIC MEANS IT WAS JUST THE PSEUDOSCIENTIFIC BELIEF THAT DISEASES ARE CAUSED BY VAGUELY DEFINED BAD AIR
PHLOGISTON THEORY IS HOW PEOPLE THOUGHT FIRE HAPPENED BEFORE THEY ACTUALLY KNEW HOW FIRE HAPPENED
THE EMISSION THEORY OF VISION IS HOW PEOPLE THOUGHT WE SAW BY EMITTING LIGHT RAYS BEFORE THEY REALIZED WE CAN ONLY SEE LIGHT REFLECTED FROM OTHER SOURCES

THERE ARE ALSO THINGS THAT ARE THEORIES IN THE DEFINITION BUT THAT AREN'T OFTEN CALLED THAT EXAMPLES INCLUDE

THERMODYNAMICS IS WITHOUT ANY EXAGGERATION THE SINGLE MOST RELIABLE PIECE OF KNOWLEDGE POSSESSED BY THE HUMAN SPECIES IT FITS THE DEFINITION OF THEORY TO A T AND BECAUSE OF ITS AMPLE EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL SUPPORT IS ALMOST GUARANTEED TO NEVER BE REPLACED THE STANDARD MODEL WILL BE REPLACED IN THE NEXT YEARS GENERAL RELATIVITY MIGHT BE REPLACED IN A SLIGHTLY LONGER TIMEFRAME I'LL BE EXTREMELY SURPRISED IF THERMODYNAMICS GETS REPLACED YOU NEVER SEE PEOPLE CALLING THERMODYNAMICS A THEORY AND IT SOUNDS EXTREMELY WEIRD IF YOU DO
THE STANDARD MODEL OF PARTICLE PHYSICS GETS THAT HUMBLE NAME MODEL
CLASSICAL MECHANICS IS ALMOST NEVER CALLED A THEORY
UNIVERSAL GRAVITATION IS A THEORY OF GRAVITY ALMOST NEVER SO DESCRIBED

I COULD GO ON BUT I THINK I MADE MY POINT

HE PROCEEDS TO EXPLAIN THAT EVOLUTION IS A FACT AND THAT THERE IS A THEORY TO EXPLAIN IT THIS IS CORRECT AND A POINT THAT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED SIMILARLY GRAVITY IS AN OBSERVATION AND GENERAL RELATIVITY IS A THEORY LATER IN THE VIDEO HE CLAIMS IT'S BOTH A LAW AND A THEORY THIS IS UNAMBIGUOUSLY WRONG

EVOLUTION HAS BEEN TESTED MORE THAN ANY OTHER THEORY WE KNOW OF

YEAH NO SIT DOWN SON NOW YOU'VE LEFT REALITY HE'S ALSO IGNORING THE VERY THING HE JUST SAID EVOLUTION THE OBSERVATION IS EXTREMELY WELL-TESTED THE THEORY OF HOW EVOLUTION HAPPENS NOT NEARLY AS MUCH IT RECEIVES CONSTANT REVISIONS AND THERE'S MUCH ABOUT IT THAT ISN'T WELL UNDERSTOOD IT'S WRONG TO PARADE IT AROUND AS THE PINNACLE OF HUMAN UNDERSTANDING WE SHOULDN'T BE ASHAMED OF THIS IT IS THE TRUTH

BESIDES WE ALL KNOW THAT THE PINNACLE OF HUMAN UNDERSTANDING IS ACTUALLY THERMODYNAMICS

A LAW IS A STATEMENT BASED ON REPEATED EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS THAT DESCRIBES SOME PHENOMENON OF NATURE

YEAH THIS ONE ISN'T NECESSARILY TRUE EITHER I'LL REFRAIN FROM POSTING EXAMPLES BECAUSE I ALREADY WENT TOO LONG THOUGH

A LAW DOESN'T DESCRIBE WHAT IS HAPPENING OR WHY FOR THAT WE NEED A THEORY

MORE ARTIFICIAL DISTINCTION THE NOTION OF EXPLAINING WHY IS NATURALLY VERY
SUBJECTIVE IN SCIENCE BECAUSE YOU CAN ALWAYS GO BACK ONE STEP

WHY DOES A CAR ROLL DOWNHILL BECAUSE IT HAS POTENTIAL ENERGY THAT CAN BE TURNED INTO KINETIC ENERGY WHY DOES THAT HAPPEN BECAUSE THERE IS A QUANTITY CALLED ENERGY WHICH IS CONSERVED BY THE VAST MAJORITY OF PHYSICAL PROCESSES WHY IS IT CONSERVED BECAUSE IT'S USUALLY IRRELEVANT WHEN AN EXPERIMENT IS PERFORMED I CAN DO IT TODAY OR TOMORROW AND GET THE SAME ANSWER A MATHEMATICAL STATEMENT KNOWN AS THEOREM IMPLIES THAT IF THE LAWS OF PHYSICS DON'T CHANGE WITH TIME A QUANTITY WILL BE CONSERVED WHICH WE CALL ENERGY WHY ARE THE LAWS OF PHYSICS INDEPENDENT OF TIME WELL I HAVE NO CLUE

WHAT'S WORSE IN HIS EXAMPLE HE CLAIMS THAT GENERAL RELATIVITY EXPLAINS LAW OF UNIVERSAL GRAVITATION IN ACTUALITY IF YOU WORK IT OUT YOU'LL FIND THAT GRAVITY IN WORLD BEHAVES DIFFERENTLY THAN WHAT NEWTON PREDICTS IN THE LANGUAGE HE JUST DEFINED AND WHICH HE HIMSELF CAN'T KEEP STRAIGHT LAW OF UNIVERSAL GRAVITATION IS A THEORY WHILE GENERAL RELATIVITY IS A COMPETING THEORY EXPLAINS MORE STUFF SO IT WINS LAWS ARE ONLY VALID AS APPROXIMATIONS

THE NOTION THAT A LAW DESCRIBES A PHENOMENON AND A THEORY EXPLAINS IT IS FRANKLY INFANTILE IT DOESN'T SURVIVE THE MOST SUPERFICIAL SCRUTINY THINK OF ALMOST ANYTHING THAT GETS CALLED A THEORY AND SEE HOW MANY ACTUALLY EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON THEY PURPORT TO DESCRIBE IN SOME SUBJECTIVE SENSE THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY FOR SURE DOES NOT AND SO ON

TL R IT'S UNSURPRISING THAT YOU'RE CONFUSED ABOUT HOW THE TERMS ARE USED AND THAT YOU'RE CONFUSED ABOUT HOW CERTAIN TERMS ARE OR AREN'T DISTINGUISHED TRUTH IS THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE TIME SCIENTISTS WILL CALL SOMETHING WHATEVER THEY FEEL LIKE CALLING IT AND BALLS TO THE POP SCIENCE DEFINITION THAT'S JUST THE TRUTH


A LAW IS JUST A MATHEMATICAL RELATIONSHIP THAT HOLDS OVER A GENERALLY WIDE RANGE OF PARAMETER SPACE THERE'S NOTHING MAGICAL ABOUT THE WORD THAT MAKES IT AN IMMUTABLE TRUTH OF NATURE
GENERALLY THEORY LAW THOUGH AS OTHERS HAVE SAID THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SEMANTIC TASTE INVOLVED

IN MY MIND A THEORY IS ESSENTIALLY AN ENTIRE USUALLY MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORK THAT ESSENTIALLY PROVIDES PRECISE QUANTITATIVE ANSWERS TO PRECISE QUANTITATIVE QUERIES IT DOESN'T JUST DESCRIBE HOW TWO EXPERIMENTALLY MEASURABLE QUANTITIES RELATE TO EACH OTHER IT PROVIDES A FULL TOOLBOX IN WHICH ONE CAN ESSENTIALLY PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF ANY EXPERIMENT IN PRINCIPLE THAT INVOLVES THE PHENOMENA IT IS DESIGNED TO MODEL

AN EXAMPLE MIGHT BE QUANTUM THEORY WANT TO KNOW WHAT FREQUENCIES OF LIGHT HELIUM GAS WILL ABSORB ASK QUANTUM THEORY I EAST USE THE MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORK TO CALCULATE IT WANT TO KNOW HOW PURE IRON WILL COMPRESS ASK QUANTUM THEORY WANT TO KNOW HOW CURRENT TRAVELS THROUGH A SEMICONDUCTOR HETEROJUNCTION FOR A TRANSISTOR ASK QUANTUM THEORY IF IT INVOLVES ATOMS OR ELECTRONS OR THE COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR OF ATOMS AND ELECTRONS I EAST BULK MATERIAL PROPERTIES YOU ASK QUANTUM THEORY

CONVERSELY LAWS ARE ESSENTIALLY A POINT WHERE SOMEONE NOTICED THAT IN THE EXPERIMENTS THEY'D SEEN SOME SIMPLE MATHEMATICAL RELATION SEEMED TO HOLD BETWEEN TWO QUANTITIES GRAVITATIONAL FORCE AND SEPARATION PRESSURE AND VOLUME VOLTAGE AND CURRENT ETC THEY MADE NO ATTEMPT TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY THIS WAS TRUE AND IF IT WAS ALWAYS TRUE AS A RESULT ALMOST EVERY LAW IN PHYSICS IS KNOWN TO BE WRONG IN GENERAL FOR EXAMPLE LAW SAYS THAT CURRENT IS PROPORTIONAL TO VOLTAGE BUT THIS IS ONLY TRUE FOR SOME MATERIALS IN SOME SITUATIONS WHICH IN TRUE CIRCULAR REASONING FASHION IS CALLED THE OHMIC REGION OF A MATERIAL SO LAW APPLIES IN THE OHMIC REGION LAW OF UNIVERSAL GRAVITATION SUPERCEDED BY GENERAL RELATIVITY IN THE THING EINSTEIN IS FAMOUS FOR LAW ONLY TRUE IF THE MOLECULES IN THE GAS DON'T STRONGLY INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER AND SO ON

THUS FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE A LAW IS A BOLD CLAIM THAT ASSERTS A SIMPLE MATHEMATICAL RELATION THAT MATCHES MOST EXISTING DATA IT IS NOT A COMPLETE FRAMEWORK AND IT HAS NO CONCEPTUAL UNDERPINNING THEY ARE ALSO GENERALLY ONLY TRUE UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS

A PRINCIPLE IS MUCH LIKE A LAW BUT IT IS MORE A CONCEPTUAL CLAIM THEN A QUANTITATIVE RELATIONSHIP THE PRINCIPLE OF LEAST TIME LIGHT FOLLOWS THE PATH THAT MINIMIZES THE TIME OF TRAVERSAL THE PAULI EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE NO TWO FERMIONS CAN BE IN THE SAME STATE ETC THUS IT IS ANOTHER BOLD SIMPLE CLAIM BUT OF A DIFFERENT CHARACTER THAN THE FORCE DUE TO GRAVITY IS PROPORTIONAL TO BOTH MASSES AND INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO THE SQUARE OF THEIR SEPARATION
A GOOD LAW OR MODEL HAS TO BE ELEGANT IT MUST MORE SIMPLY DESCRIBE EVENTS AND ACCURATELY THAN OTHER MODELS IT'S FRUITFUL IT HAS MANY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPROVES OUR UNDERSTANDING OF EVENTS IN EXISTENCE WELL BEYOND WHAT WAS KNOWN BEFORE IT MUST ALSO SUBSTANTIALLY SIMPLIFY PREVIOUSLY NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD PHENOMENA

FOR INSTANCE PERIOD CHART OF THE ELEMENTS HE BEGAN TO SEE PATTERNS IN THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ELEMENTS THE ALKALI METALS THE FERROUS METALS THE HALOGENS AND THE NOBLE GASES HIS ARRANGEMENTS LED DIRECTLY TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF BONDING AS THE ALKALI METALS HAVE A CHARGE OF THE HALOGEN AND THUS THEY CAN BOND IN A RATIO IT EXPLAINED CHEMICAL BONDING AS WELL YOU SEE

HIS SIMPLE RULES LED TO THE DISCOVERY AND PRODUCTION OF MANY MORE ELEMENTS BECAUSE HIS ARRANGEMENT FOUND EMPTY SPOTS IN THE SERIES SO IT WAS ALSO FRUITFUL AS WELL AS ORGANIZING THE ELEMENTS SIMPLY TOO AND IT LED TO THE FINDING OF THE CATALYTIC SERIES OF ELEMENTS NI PT PT TOO THE RARE EARTHS THE RADIUM SERIES AND THE TRANSURANIDES IN THIS LAST CENTURY TOO

SO THE RULES OF HIS ORGANIZATION OF THE ELEMENTS LED TO MUCH MORE CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS INSIGHTS FINDINGS AND FUNDAMENTAL RULES AS WELL LEADING TO QM AND CHEMISTRY AND SO ON
PUTTING A PRESENTATION TOGETHER FOR GROUP MEETING AND COMPILING RESULTS INTO A PAPER THIS ONE NEVER ENDS
JUST PUT AN ARTICLE ONTO THE ARXIV TRYING TO FINISH UP WRITING ANOTHER ARTICLE TO PUT ON THE ARXIV BEFORE GETTING STARTED ON A NEW PROJECT ALL WHILE TRYING TO BALANCE THIS WITH AN AWFUL TEACHING ASSIGNMENT I'M TAING A GRAD COURSE WITH PEOPLE ENROLLED AND I HAVE TO GRADE WEEKLY HOMEWORKS LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING BACK TO THE FUN PART OF PHYSICS
LECTURES STARTED AGAIN THIS SEMESTER I GOT PARTICLE AND NUCLEAR PHYSICS SOLID-STATE PHYSICS AND THERMODYNAMICS AND STATISTICAL PHYSICS

THE MAIN WORKLOAD HOWEVER IS GOING TO BE BECAUSE OF SOME PRACTICAL WORK WE HAVE TO DO BASICALLY EVERY FRIDAY UNTIL CHRISTMAS

WE WERE TOLD THAT IT WILL TAKE HOURS OF PREOPERATION HOURS OF WORK IN THE LAB AND HOURS TO ANALYSE THE DATA AND WRITE A REPORT

ATLEAST WE GOT TOPICS WE LIKED ALTHOUGH WE DIDNT GET OUR FAVORITES

WE GOT



LIFETIME OF LYONS

PHOTOEMISSION SPECTROSCOPY

OPTICAL EMISSION AND ABSORPTION SPECTRUMS

NUCLEAR REACTOR

TRANSVERSAL VIBRATING REED MAGNETOMETER

OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY

ACTIVITY DETERMINATION RADIOACTIVE SAMPLES

FIRST ONE STARTING THIS WEEK

ALSO HAD TO GET MORE FAMILIAR WITH LATEX


TRYING TO CHANGE MAJORS TO MATHEMATICS AND AT THE SAME TIME DRILLING THROUGH SOME REALLY BORING INTRO LEVEL EM AND MECHANICS GLAD I FINALLY KNOW WHAT I WANT TO DO THOUGH
I'M GRADING HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS QUIZZES ON INTERPRETING POSITION VS TIME GRAPHS AND I'M FRUSTRATED BY THE OF STUDENTS WHO INSIST AT LOOKING AT A PVT GRAPH AND SEEING THE PATH OF THE OBJECT TAKEN INSTEAD OF THE DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE ORIGIN OF A FRAME OF REFERENCE

NO THE CAT IS NOT GOING UP AND DOWN A HILL ITS GOING FORWARDS AND BACKWARDS FAST THEN SLOW
IN MY UNDERCLASSMEN PHYSICS COURSE WE WERE DISCUSSING LINEAR MOMENTUM THEN OUT OF NOWHERE OUR PROFESSOR STARTS TALKING ABOUT RELATIVISTIC MOMENTUM AND DERIVES E MC 2 I SAT THERE TAKING NOTES IN AWE AND TOTAL CONFUSION
CURRENTLY REAPPLYING TO GRAD SCHOOL AND I'M REMEMBERING HOW MUCH I HATE WRITING STATEMENTS OF PURPOSE
IT'S OBVIOUSLY WRONG LOOKING AT HIS DOCUMENT

IF OUR FOR EXAMPLE WAVEFUNCTION IS P THE AUTHOR CLAIMS THAT P P2 PAGE

IN REALITY THIS IS JUST A RANK APPROXIMATION OF P AND REPRESENTING THE WAVEFUNCTION THAT WAY MEANS THAT YOU CAN'T CAPTURE ENTANGLEMENT EFFECTS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT

THIS DOESN'T BOTHER THE AUTHOR HE SIMPLY DECLARES THAT THIS MEANS THAT THE PAULI EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE DOESN'T APPLY TO ELECTRONS AND THAT MAKING ELECTRON WAVEFUNCTIONS ANTISYMMETRIC DOESN'T MATTER PAGE

THIS IS OF COURSE OBVIOUSLY WRONG IF THE QUANTUM PROBLEM WERE SO EASY THAT YOU COULD SIMPLY DECLARE P P2 AND BE DONE WITH IT THEN PEOPLE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THE PROBLEM WITH ONLY MINIMAL SUCCESS FOR LAST YEARS

EDIT I JUST REALIZED WHY HE DOESN'T NOTICE THAT HE'S WRONG HE USES THE HELIUM ATOM AS AN EXAMPLE AND NOTES THAT HIS APPROACH GETS THE CORRECT ANSWER THAT'S BECAUSE OF SPIN DEGENERACY I'M ASSUMING HIS RESULTS ARE RIGHT I DIDN'T DOUBLE CHECK HIS WORK THE ELECTRONS ACTUALLY ARE IN THE SAME STATE FOR THE GROUND STATE OF THE HELIUM ATOM IF HE TRIED THIS WITH LITHIUM OR SOMETHING THEN IT WOULDN'T WORK
THIS IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH QM IT JUST ASSUMES ALL WAVEFUNCTIONS AND SEPARABLE AND THEN DRONES ON AND ON ON HOW THIS REDUCES IMMENSELY THE DIMENSION OF THE STATE SPACE WELL DUH

SO APPARENTLY THE EXPLANATION FOR ENTANGLEMENT IS THAT ENTANGLEMENT NEVER HAPPENS
I NEVER SAW WHY A HUMAN MIND SHOULD HAVE ANY SPECIAL ROLE HOW IS A BUNCH OF ATOMS DIFFERENT IF IT FORMS A MIND VS IF IT FORMS A ROCK AND WHEN EXACTLY DOES A HUMAN START TO HAVE A MIND THAT COUNTS AS MIND

THE WAVE FUNCTION FOR EACH ELECTRON

I WOULD HAVE AT LEAST EXPECTED SOMETHING COMPATIBLE WITH SPECIAL RELATIVITY
PUBLICATION
NICE ARTICLE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE FLYWHEEL EITHER

WHERE DID YOU GET THAT PALMEIRAS SHIRT U
WITH A PHD IN QUANTUM INFORMATION THEORY

OUTSIDE OF RESEARCH MOST PHS IN YOUR FIELD WOULD PROBABLY BE FOUND IN CONSULTING IT OR ANYTHING WITH NUMBERS STATISTICS NUMBER CRUNCHING BUSINESS ANALYTICS MAYBE TECHNICAL SIMULATIONS ALL OF THESE JOBS WOULD VERY LIKELY BE UNRELATED TO QUANTUM PHYSICS

JOBS POSTDOCS RESEARCH ASSISTANT POSITIONS

TALK TO PEOPLE YOU KNOW THEN TALK TO PEOPLE WHO WORK ON INTERESTING STUFF THEN FIND ONE OF THE WEB SITES THAT HAVE ACADEMIC JOBS IN GERMANY I REMEMBER THIS ONE
I SAW THIS DOCUMENTARY CALLED TIMECOP A FEW YEARS AGO THEY MIGHT NEED NEED A QUANTUM INFORMATION THEORY CONSULTANT
I KNOW COPENHAGEN DENMARK HAS A LOT GOING ON RIGHT NOW DTU AND THE NIELS BOHR INSTITUTE HAVE MADE A COUPLE OF COMPANIES AND RESEARCH CENTERS CDEV BIZ SPARROW QUANTUM ETC THAT ARE BASED ON QUANTUM INFORMATION SOME CALL IT THE FUTURE QUANTUM VALLEY
DATA SCIENCE
MATT STRASSLER JUST CAME OUT WITH A FOLLOW-UP BLOG POST TO THIS ONE IN WHICH HE HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF LOOKING FOR PARTICLES WHOSE INTERACTIONS WITH KNOWN PARTICLES ARE VERY WEAK HE TALKS ABOUT A TIP HE RECEIVED FROM PROFESSOR MATT REECE ON A RECENT PAPER INVOLVING A SEARCH OF THIS TYPE BUT WAS NOT OBVIOUS FROM THE PAPER'S TITLE

HE ALSO WANTED TO CORRECT AN IMPRESSION THAT SOME HAD ON READING THE ORIGINAL POST HIS MAIN POINT IS TO STRESS THE NEED TO BE DOING THIS TYPE OF SEARCH NOT THAT HE THINKS THE ANALYSIS OF THE ALEPH DATA BY ARNO HEISTER ACTUALLY FOUND SOMETHING HIDDEN BUT HE URGES A FOCUS ON THE CONSTRAINTS THAT ONE CAN OBTAIN AND THE POTENTIAL DISCOVERIES THAT ONE COULD MAKE WITH THIS TYPE OF ANALYSIS EITHER AT LEP OR AT LOC
THAT REFERS TO THE METRIC SIGNATURE I EAST THE CONVENTION IF THE TIME COORDINATE HAS A NEGATIVE SIGN AND SPATIAL COORDINATES POSITIVE SIGN OR VICE VERSA
THE LINE ELEMENT IS THE DIFFERENTIAL FORM OF THE PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM FOR SPACETIME IN EUCLIDEAN SPACE IT IS DS 2 DX 2 DY 2 DZ 2 WHEN YOU START DEALING WITH SPACETIME INSTEAD OF SPACE YOU NEED A TIME COMPONENT WHICH HAS THE OPPOSITE SIGN OF THE SPATIAL COMPONENTS FOR MINKOWSKI SPACE FOR EXAMPLE IT IS DS 2 C 2 DT 2 DX 2 DY 2 DZ 2 ALTHOUGH SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE PERVERTED AND WRONG MAKE THE TIME PART POSITIVE AND THE SPATIAL PARTS NEGATIVE HAVING IT AND ARE THE TWO SIGNATURE CONVENTIONS
THE WIKI PAGE ON LAW OF INERTIA HAS A GOOD EXPLANATION
YOU'RE THINKING OF QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT I BELIEVE
YOU MIGHT BE TALKING ABOUT QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT

IT'S WHAT I'M CURRENTLY RESEARCHING
MATH GET GOOD AT CALCULUS AT A MINIMUM IF YOU CAN TAKE VECTOR CALCULUS LINEAR ALGEBRA ANYTHING
I'M GONNA AGREE WITH THE OTHER POSTER MATH IS THE BIGGEST STUMBLING BLOCK FOR MOST PEOPLE WHEN IT COMES TO HIGHER PHYSICS COURSES BEYOND CALCULUS I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT SUBJECT TO LEARN IS LINEAR ALGEBRA

YOU MIGHT ALSO TRY WATCHING THE SUSSKIND LECTURES ON QUANTUM MECHANICS OR READING QM

FURTHER ALONG IN QM AND PARTICLE PHYSICS GROUP THEORY BECOMES VERY IMPORTANT AS WELL
HOWDY I WAS IN A SIMILAR BOAT NOT TOO LONG AGO I WENT TO A CC TRANSFERRED TO A UNIVERSITY WAS AN EE MAJOR FOR A BIT THEN SWITCHED TO COMPUTER ENGINEERING AND PHYSICS

BOTH EE AND PHYSICS ARE SUPER MATH INTENSIVE SO FOR THE MOST PART I'D BE CONCERNED ABOUT DOING WELL IN YOUR INTRO PHYSICS CLASSES AND BUILDING A STRONG FOUNDATION IN MATHEMATICS CALCULUS LINEAR ALGEBRA DIFF EAS AND STATS ARE GONNA SHOW UP IN YOUR EE AND PHYSICS UPPER LEVEL COURSES GET GOOD AT THOSE NOW SO YOU ALREADY KNOW IT CAN RELEARN IT EASILY IN THE FUTURE

AS FAR AS PREPARING FOR MODERN CLASSICAL MECHANICS AND E M GOES SURE YOU CAN TRY AND TEACH YOURSELF THOSE SUBJECTS AT LEAST PERUSE SOME TEXTBOOKS SO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'LL BE IN FOR JUST KEEP IN MIND YOU'LL STILL HAVE TO TAKE THOSE CLASSES WHEN YOU TRANSFER
HAVING B AVERAGE IS GOING TO DING YOU MOST GRADUATE SCHOOLS REQUIRE A MINIMUM OF A AVERAGE ACROSS ALL PREVIOUS COURSEWORK IN ORDER TO BE ACCEPTED

THAT SAID IF YOU ACE THE GENERAL GRE THE PHYSICS GRE I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR IT IT SAVED MY ASS HAVE RESEARCH EXPERIENCE AND SOLID LETTERS OF REC YOU'LL PROBABLY BE ABLE TO FIND A PLACE

AS TO IF YOU SHOULD GO TO GRADUATE SCHOOL OR NOT THAT'S A TOUGHER QUESTION I'M ONLY A FIRST YEAR GRADUATE STUDENT BUT PEOPLE IN THE PROGRAM I'M IN CAME FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS SOME PEOPLE WANT TO LEARN QUANTITATIVE SKILLS AND THEN GO STRAIGHT INTO FINANCE CONSULTING ALTHOUGH THEY'RE RARE SOME PEOPLE WANT TO GET A JOB WORKING IN INDUSTRY AS SOON AS THEY GRADUATE SOME PEOPLE WANT TO TRY TO GO IN ACADEMIA AFTER THEIR PHD THERE ARE PLENTY OF GOOD REASONS TO GO TO GRAD SCHOOL IN PHYSICS I'M HERE BECAUSE I ENJOYED MY RESEARCH EXPERIENCE AS AN UNDERGRAD AND THOUGHT PHYSICS WAS THE COOLEST THING AROUND AND WANTED TO LEARN MORE OF IT AND KEEP DOING IT BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA OF WHAT I WANT TO DO AFTERWARDS

THERE ARE DEFINITELY SOME REASONS NOT TO GO INTO GRADUATE SCHOOL THOUGH DON'T GO INTO GRAD SCHOOL FOR PHYSICS BECAUSE NOTHING ELSE LOOKS APPEALING AND YOU JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE DO TO DON'T GO INTO IT WITH THE EXPECTATION OF MAKING A TON OF MONEY DOWN THE ROAD

IN MY OPINION THE ONLY GOOD REASON TO GO TO GRADUATE SCHOOL IN PHYSICS IS THAT YOU THINK PHYSICS IS AWESOME AND WANT TO DO IT HOURS A WEEK EVERY WEEK FOR THE NEXT YEARS OF YOUR LIFE YOU CAN HAVE OTHER REASONS TOO JOBS CAREER GOALS ECT BUT THAT SHOULD BE THE CORE

IF YOU'RE ROUGHLY WHEN YOU ENTER GRADUATE SCHOOL IT TAKES YOU YEARS AND YOU DIE WHEN YOU'RE YOU'LL BE SPENDING OF THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IN GRADUATE SCHOOL SIT DOWN AND THINK ABOUT THAT AND ASK YOURSELF AM I OK WITH BEING A GRADUATE STUDENT FOR ONE OUT OF EVERY DAYS I HAVE LEFT IN MY LIFE

IF THE ANSWER ISN'T AN ENTHUSIASTIC YES YOU REALLY SHOULD RECONSIDER WHETHER GRADUATE SCHOOL IS FOR YOU
HONESTLY JUST GET AN ENGINEERING MASTERS AND GET A DECENT JOB PHD REALLY ISN'T WORTH IT UNLESS YOU REALLY LOVE PHYSICS AND EVEN THEN A CAREER IN PHYSICS IS UNLIKELY
IF YOU ARE REALLY SKEPTICAL DON'T DO A PHD PROGRAM WORK MAKE MONEY SAVE AS MUCH MONEY AS YOU CAN AND CONTINUE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU WANT I ASSUME YOU ARE YOUNG WHAT IS YOUR IDEAL JOB
YOUR B IS DEFINITELY GOING TO HURT I COULDN'T GET IN ANYWHERE WITH MY OUT OF EVEN WITH MY EXTENSIVE RESEARCH EXPERIENCE AND ACADEMIC REFERENCES FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY YOUR DOUBLE MAJOR COULD DEFINITELY HELP BUT A LOT OF IT MIGHT COME DOWN TO YOUR PHYSICS GRE SCORE

HERE'S A SAMPLE TEST THERE ARE OTHERS YOU CAN FIND AND RESOURCES YOU CAN USE TO STUDY FROM

ALSO HAVE YOU DONE ANY UNDERGRAD RESEARCH AT ALL YOUR ABILITY TO SOLVE CLASSROOM PROBLEMS DOESN'T TRANSLATE WELL TO YOUR ABILITY TO DO RESEARCH SO WHEN YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE INTUITION THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T HANDLE A PHD GETTING THROUGH GRADUATE SCHOOL IS ABOUT DETERMINATION AND PUTTING IN THE WORK AND IF YOU CAN FIND AN AREA OF RESEARCH THAT CAN BENEFIT FROM YOUR MECHANICAL ENGINEERING DEGREE THEN YOU'LL HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER OTHER STUDENTS
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'VE TOLD NUMEROUS STUDENTS THAT HAVE ASKED ME IF THEY SHOULD DO A PHD YOU MAY NOT LIKE OR UNDERSTAND IT AND YOU MAY THINK THERE IS A HIDDEN SUB CONTEXT BUT THERE ISN'T HERE GOES

THERE IS ONLY ONE REASON WHY YOU SHOULD DO A PHD YOU REALLY REALLY WANT TO TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN'T IMAGINE WHO YOU'LL BE IF YOU DON'T DO IT IF YOU'VE GOT ANY OTHER REASONS BUT NOT THIS ONE FORGET ABOUT IT DO SOMETHING THAT'LL GIVE YOU A JOB MONEY AND LIFE FULFILMENT

PARTICULARLY IN PHYSICS IF YOU THINK YOUR PHD WILL GIVE YOU MONEY A CARER A JOB RECOGNITION AND EVEN RESPECT YOU ARE MISTAKEN IT WILL NOT A PHD IS STRUGGLE DISAPPOINTMENT PATIENCE PERSISTENCE BOREDOM STRESS MORE STRESS SO MUCH STRESS AND ENDLESS REPETITION OF TRIVIAL TASKS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT YOU IMAGINE RESEARCH IS ABOUT

DAT THO WHEN THINGS WORK AND YOU REALISE YOU'RE GENUINELY THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD DOING WHAT YOU DO THAT MAKES THE REST WORTH IT THIS IS FOR ME THE ONLY REASON WHY ANYONE SHOULD EVER DO A PHD SO HAVE A CHAT WITH YOURSELF AND DECIDE

I'M SORRY IF I COME ACROSS AS NEGATIVE BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW THE TRUTH I DID A PHD IN EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS BECAUSE I COULD NOT EVEN CONTEMPLATE NOT CONTINUING STUDYING PHYSICS AND YEARS LATER I WOULD NOT CHANGE A THING HAVING SEEN WHAT IT'S LIKE THOUGH THE ONLY THING THAT KEPT ME GOING IS THAT I WANTED TO DO IT AND COULD NOT HAVE IT ANY OTHER WAY

TL R DO IT FOR THE LOVE NOT FOR ANYTHING ELSE

DROPS MIC
YEAH THE ONLY REASON SOMEONE SHOULD GET A PHD IS IF THEY WANT TO DO RESEARCH AND EVEN THEN I WOULD REALLY RECOMMEND DOING SOME SUMMER RESEARCH PROJECTS TO GET A TASTE OF WHAT RESEARCH IS BEFORE MAKING UP YOUR MIND
A PHD IS TOO GENERAL WHAT KIND OF PHD AND WHERE

I WOULD PERSONALLY STAY AWAY FROM HARD-CORE PHYSICS FIELDS UNLESS THE FIELD IS TRULY YOUR PASSION I AM NOT VERY CONVINCED THAT YOU WILL GET ANYWHERE FOR EXAMPLE AFTER A PHD IN EXOTIC PARTICLES OBSIDE OF CERN FERMILAB AND CO OF COURSE YOU CAN ALWAYS GET A NORMAL JOB AFTER BUT YOU WILL END UP COMPETING WITH FRESH GRADUATES ON EQUAL STAND BECAUSE YOUR PHD WILL NOT BE VALUED MUCH

ON THE OTHER HAND A PHD IN INDUSTRY RELEVANT TOPICS I EAST APPLIED PHYSICS CAN OPEN YOU SOME DOORS AND WOULD MIX WELL WITH YOUR MECHANICAL ENGINEERING KNOWLEDGE TALKING ABOUT BATTERY RESEARCH MATERIALS ELECTRONIC DEVICES MECHATRONICS

FINALLY I DID MY OWN PHD IN THE NETHERLANDS BUT I HAD CONTACT WITH DOCTORATES FROM PRETTY MUCH ALL OVER THE WORLD FROM WHAT I HEARD I CANNOT RECOMMEND U SOUTH PHS YOU HAVE A HIGH CHANCE OF STAGNATING FOR YEARS UNTIL GRADUATING IN EUROPE IN GENERAL YOU WILL DEDICATE YEARS IN UK ALTHOUGH IT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE WRITING PART YOU ARE NOT PAID FOR WHICH IS MUCH MORE REASONABLE PLACES LIKE DENMARK NL ARE PRETTY GOOD YOU GET PAID TREATED AND HAVE THE LEGAL STATUS OF A WORKER NOT A STUDENT AND YOU WILL GET BY IN ENGLISH GERMANY IS NOT SO GREAT LOW WAGE EXPECT LOTS OF TEACHING TO MAKE SOME DECENT LIVING

SO I WOULD DO A BIT OF RESEARCH ABOUT TOPICS AND PLACES AND PICK SOMETHING THAT YOU LIKE I CAN GUARANTEE YOU THAT AFTER THREE YEARS ON IT YOU WILL HAVE A LOVE HATE FEELING FOR THE TOPIC BUT YOU WILL PUSH THROUGH ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU JUST LAND ANY PHD WITHOUT MUCH INTEREST NOT GOOD
YOU SHOULD THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT WHAT IT IS YOU WANT TO DO HAVING PASSION AND INTEREST IN A SUBJECT IS GREAT BUT IT'S THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY TRANSLATE TO A SUSTAINABLE CAREER ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU YES SPECIFICALLY TO THIS PLAN BUT I DO GENERALLY ENDORSE THE IDEA OF GOING STRAIGHT TO A PHD IF YOU THINK YOU WANT TO IT'S A LOT EASIER TO KEEP BEING A STUDENT THAN IT IS TO GO BACK TO BEING A STUDENT
THE WAY I'VE HAD IT EXPLAINED TO ME IS THAT IF YOU FEEL THE NEED TO QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT IT'S THE RIGHT CALL THEN IT'S NOT THE RIGHT CALL FOR PHYSICS GETTING A PHD SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING DONE FAR MORE OUT OF PASSION THAN PRACTICALITY
WHAT ABOUT JOB AVAILABILITY AND THE CURSE HOW MUCH CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THAT DILEMMA

THAT IS WHAT I WOULD BE CONCERNED WITH MOST
HAVE YOU DONE ANY RESEARCH I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND GOING INTO A GRADUATE PROGRAM UNLESS YOU ARE CONFIDENT YOU ENJOY DOING RESEARCH IN THAT FIELD

A PHYSICS PH D WILL TRAIN YOU TO BE A PHYSICS RESEARCHER AND THE TRAINING IS BRUTAL IF YOU ENJOY THAT GO FOR IT YOUR GRADES WILL DAMAGE YOUR CHANCES BUT A GOOD RESEARCH RECORD CAN MAKE UP FOR IT

IF YOU DON'T LIKE RESEARCH RUN RUN FAR AWAY

IF YOU HAVEN'T TRIED RESEARCH I RECOMMEND GETTING A SUMMER INTERNSHIP MAYBE AN AEU IF YOU'RE IN THE U SOUTH BEFORE EVEN CONSIDERING GRAD SCHOOL

I HAVE TO ADMIT I'M ALSO SURPRISED AND A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT YOU FOR EXAMPLE DID NOT SAY WHICH TOPICS IN PHYSICS YOU'D LIKE TO STUDY GRAD SCHOOL IS ABOUT SPECIALIZATION IT'S WHERE YOU BECOME THE WORLD'S LEADING EXPERT IN A TINY OF A TINY DO YOU LIKE THEORY OR EXPERIMENT WHAT ABOUT COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS ARE YOU INTO AMO HIGH ENERGY CONDENSED MATTER QUANTUM INFORMATION GRAVITY PLASMAS TURBULENCE OR SOMETHING ELSE

IF YOU HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THESE QUESTIONS YOU NEED TO FIND ANSWERS BEFORE YOU LOOK AT GRAD SCHOOL AND THE SEARCH FOR ANSWERS MIGHT HELP YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
DON'T DO A PHD UNLESS YOU ARE PRETTY CERTAIN THAT YOU WANT TO DO IT A PHD IS A LONG PROCESS AT LEAST YEARS AND THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF DAYS WHERE YOU FEEL LIKE QUITTING
IF YOU'RE UNSURE THEN DON'T DO IT IT'S NOT THE RIGHT THING FOR YOU ONLY DO IT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO AND IT'S NOT EVEN A QUESTION PHYSICS IS FASCINATING BUT A PHD IS A WHOLE OTHER THING

I STARTED A PHD PROGRAM AFTER UNDERGRAD BECAUSE I WASN'T SURE WHAT I WANTED TO DO APART FROM GETTING A MASCULINE SOUTH OUT OF IT THAT WAS A MISTAKE
JUST TO CHIME IN MY 2 CENTS I ALSO LOVED PHYSICS BUT HAD A PRETTY BAD GA IN FIRST SEMESTER JUST UNDER A I USUALLY NEEDED A LOT MORE HELP THAN OTHER STUDENTS AND NEVER REALLY FELT I WAS VERY GOOD AT THE SUBJECT I APPLIED FOR GRAD SCHOOLS BUT DIDN'T GET IN ANYWHERE STARTED A TOWARDS BECOMING A SECONDARY TEACHER FOUND THE PROGRAM REALLY UNREWARDING SO I TRIED ONE MORE TIME TO GET INTO AN MSC PROGRAM GOT INTO MANCHESTER WHERE I DID MY MSC LO AND BEHOLD I WAS REALLY GOOD AT RESEARCH AND DID QUITE WELL IN THE PROGRAM NOW I'M DOING MY PHD IN PARIS AND AGAIN I FIND I AM NOT HAVING MUCH TROUBLE KEEPING UP WITH MY RESEARCH AND LOVE BEING PART OF THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY SO JUST TO LET YOU KNOW UNDERGRAD AND RESEARCH ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS AND YOU CAN BE BAD AT ONE AND GOOD AT THE OTHER
I'D SAY IF YOU'RE NOT SURE YOU WANT TO DO IT AT THIS POINT IT MAY NOT BE FOR YOU YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BECOME MORE EXCITED ABOUT IT AS YOU GET DEEPER INTO THE PROGRAM

I WAS SURE FOR TWO YEARS BEFORE I BEGAN APPLYING I WAS SURE FOR MY FIRST YEARS OF GRAD SCHOOL BUT EVEN MY LOVE OF THE SUBJECT AND THE ENJOYMENT I GOT FROM DOING IT EVERY SINGLE DAY WASN'T ENOUGH TO PREVENT ME FROM SOMETIMES REGRETTING MY DECISION YEARS LATER WHEN I FINALLY FINISHED MY PHD IF ACADEMIA IS NOT YOUR DREAM PLACE AND EVEN IF IT IS IT VERY WELL MAY BECOME HELL IF YOU GO INTO A CERTAIN FIELD OR GET STUCK IN A CERTAIN GROUP OR THINGS DON'T GO AS YOU WISH IF YOU WANT TO MAKE MONEY IN INDUSTRY GET A MASTER'S IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING ONLY DO A PHD IF YOU PLAN TO BE A RESEARCH PHYSICIST OR A PROFESSOR
I HAVE TO SAY THAT NOTHING IN YOUR POST GAVE ME ANY INDICATION THAT A PHYSICS PHD IS A STRONG CHOICE FOR YOU I LOVED PHYSICS HAD GOOD GRADES AND I STRUGGLED FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS DOING A PHYSICS PHD IF YOU LOVE PHYSICS THERE ARE MANY CAREERS THAT YOU CAN DO THAT INVOLVE THINKING EG ENGINEERING PROGRAMMING IT FINANCE EVEN

YOU COULD TRY TO TAKE ON A SMALL RESEARCH PROJECT IN PHYSICS AND SEE HOW YOU GET ON BUT HONESTLY NOTHING YOU'VE SAID MAKES IT SOUND LIKE A GOOD IDEA TO DO A PHD LOTS OF PEOPLE STUDY PHYSICS AS PART OF THEIR STUDIES LIKE ENGINEERS OR DOCTORS AND THEY OFTEN LOVE IT BUT DOING IT AS A CAREER IS VERY DIFFERENT
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE AGRE OR BETTER GETS YOU IN
HELLO THERE FELLOW BITSIAN
PHYSICS IS ALSO WHAT I'M CONSIDERING TO STUDY AT UNI I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW TOO IS GETTING A PHD PRETTY MUCH REQUIRED TO GET EMPLOYED I HAVE HEARD SO MUCH THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE YOU MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT TO GET A JOB
DO IT PHYSICS IS GREAT AND IF YOU CAN GET INTO GRAD SCHOOL THEY GENERALLY PAY YOU TO STUDY AND DO RESEARCH IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND HALF WAY THROUGH LEAVE WITH A MASTERS WORST POSSIBLE CASE IS THAT YOU SPEND A BUNCH OF MONEY APPLYING TO GRAD SCHOOLS AND SENDING GRE SCORES THEN GET REJECTED SO YOU MIGHT POSSIBLY LOSE LIKE APPLYING TO SCHOOLS
YES


EDIT YOU FUCKS DOWNVOTE BUT HAVE NO IDEA WHY I SAID YES

HERE IS THE REASON I FIND PHYSICS IMMENSELY FASCINATING AND I LOVED STUDYING THE COURSES

ENOUGH REASONING SCREW THE GA ITS ABOUT PASSION
THE BEST THING THAT YOU CAN DO IS TAKE CARE OF YOUR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS EAT HEALTHY FOODS GET ENOUGH SLEEP EXERCISE REGULARLY PARTICULARLY CARDIOVASCULAR EXERCISE AND SPEND TIME RELAXING WITH FRIENDS

IT MAY SEEM LIKE AN INDULGENCE TO DO THOSE THINGS WHEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO GET DONE BUT IT ISN'T DOING THOSE THINGS CONSISTENTLY WILL KEEP YOUR STRESS LEVELS LOW AND WILL IMPROVE YOUR ABILITY TO FOCUS AND THINK CLEARLY ALL OF WHICH WILL ENABLE YOU TO DO BETTER WORK IN THE TIME THAT YOU SPEND WORKING
SAME HERE TAKING SOME REAL BREAK TIME HELP ME A LITTLE DOING SPORT ETC BUT THE AMOUNT OF WORK IS REALLY BITING MY NERVES TOO
HAVING SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO WITH A CLEAR DEADLINE FOR WHEN IT WOULD BE OVER WORKED FOR ME I BOOKED A TRIP FOR JUST AFTER I FINISHED MY HONOURS AND LEFT LIKE A WEEK AFTER MY DEFENCE IT HELPED ME TO KNOW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING COMING UP WHERE I COULD HAVE A BREAK FROM RESPONSIBILITIES AND IT WAS FAR AWAY FROM UNI TOO
GENERAL RELATIVITY AND COSMOLOGY UNSOLVED QUESTIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS BY DEBONO AND SMOOT
BY DEFINITION ALL THE PAPERS IN THE JOURNAL REVIEWS OF MODERN PHYSICS GIVE A TECHNICAL OVERVIEW OF SOME SUBFIELD OF PHYSICS USUALLY THE SCOPE OF THESE ARTICLES IS VERY NARROW BUT THERE ARE SOME WHICH ARE REASONABLY BROAD WHICH MAY BE OF INTEREST TO YOU
THIS PAPER IS A VERY RECENT AND VERY GOOD REVIEW ARTICLE ON THE FIELD OF INTERACTIONS FOCUSSING SPECIFICALLY ON PORPHYRIES AND PHTHALOCYANINE
THE NUCLEAR SCIENCE ADVISORY COMMITTEE SAC LONG RANGE PLAN GIVES AN OVERVIEW OF EVERYTHING HAPPENING IN NUCLEAR SCIENCE BASICALLY NUCLEAR PHYSICS AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY AND THE DIRECTION IN WHICH WE WANT THE FIELD TO GO I DON'T WANT TO LINK TO IT BECAUSE IT'S A HUGE PDF BUT IT'S EASILY FOUND ON GOOGLE
FOR TECHNICAL REVIEWS OF PARTICLE PHYSICS CHECK OUT PARTICLE DATA GROUP
CARL SAGAN AND RICHARD FEYNMAN GREW UP IN A DIFFERENT TIME DON'T COMPARE YOUR SITUATION NOW TO THEIR SITUATION ALMOST A CENTURY AGO NOT ONLY WERE THE FINANCES DIFFERENT BUT THE WAY PHYSICS WAS DONE WAS DIFFERENT

THAT BEING SAID I'M ON THE SIDE OF GET THE MOST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK IF MONEY IS AT ALL A CONCERN FOR YOU THEN YOU SHOULD NOT SPEND IT TO GET YOUR UNDERGRAD YOU CAN STILL LEARN AND DO PHYSICS AT ACF

AS A SIDE QUESTION DON'T THEY HAVE A STRONG AMO PROGRAM THERE I'VE NEVER HEARD OF OPTICS PROGRAM BUT I'VE DEFINITELY HEARD OF JUST BECAUSE ACF ISN'T A PRIVATE SCHOOL DOESN'T MEAN THEY DON'T DO GOOD PHYSICS
NYU IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY FOR UNDERGRAD AS IT STANDS TODAY IT IS FAR BETTER JUST TO GO TO YOUR LOCAL STATE SCHOOL WORK REALLY REALLY HARD AND GET INTO A GOOD GRAD SCHOOL WHICH IS WHAT REALLY MATTERS FOR PHYSICS IT'LL BE BETTER FOR YOUR MENTAL HEALTH AS WELL AND YOUR LIKELINESS TO SIMPLY GRADUATE GENERALLY YOUR LIKELINESS TO GRADUATE IS TIED NOT TO YOUR ABSOLUTE COMPETENCE BUT YOUR COMPETENCE COMPARED TO YOUR COLLEAGUES THAT IS THE TALENT CONCENTRATION OF PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITIES MAKES IT MORE TAXING ON YOUR MENTAL HEALTH AND WILL MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO COMPETE FOR SCHOLARSHIPS RESEARCH INTERNSHIPS ETC OF COURSE ATTENDING A VERY TOP UNIVERSITY LIKE CALTECH WOULD PROBABLY BE WORTH IT BUT EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE PLACES LIKE NYU NORTHWESTERN VANDERBILT RICE DUKE ETC DON'T REALLY JUSTIFY THEIR COST FOR UNDERGRAD
FIRST OFF IT IS POSSIBLE TO ATTEND ANY UNIVERSITY PHYSICS PROGRAM WORK REALLY HARD GET PUBLISHED GET GOOD TEST SCORES AND HAVE A SUCCESSFUL PHYSICS CAREER HOWEVER THE BIGGER THE NAME OF THE UNIVERSITY YOU GO TO THE EASIER IT IS TO GET INTO GRAD SCHOOL GET A RESEARCH JOB POST GRADUATION OBTAIN FELLOWSHIPS ETC

AS MUCH AS PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO ADMIT IT INDEPENDENT OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING NAME RECOGNITION IS ONE OF THE EASIEST WAYS TO GET IN THE DOOR AND PHYSICS IS ONE OF THE FIELDS MOST GUILTY OF BASING DECISIONS ON NAME IF YOU CHOOSE TO GO TO A SCHOOL WITH A BETTER NAME IN MY EXPERIENCE THINGS WILL BE A LOT SIMPLER FOR YOU

WHEN I WAS IN GRAD SCHOOL LARGE STATE SCHOOL THERE WERE MANY OF MY FELLOW STUDENTS WHO LAMENTED THEIR DECISION TO CHOOSE SCHOOLS BASED ON RESEARCH INTEREST OVER SOMETHING LIKE THAT RATHER THAN SIMPLY NAME RECOGNITION FOR YOU THINKING ABOUT UNDERGRADUATE THE SAME WILL BE THE CASE WHEN YOU APPLY FOR GRADUATE SCHOOL THE SCHOOL YOU GO TO FUN UNDERGRAD IS THE FIRST THING ADMISSIONS SEES WHEN THEY LOOK AT YOUR APPLICATION I AM NOT SAYING YOU CAN'T GO TO ACF OR EVEN THAT GOING TO ACF WILL MAKE IT UNLIKELY FOR YOU TO GET INTO A GOOD GRAD SCHOOL I AM JUST SAYING THAT IT WILL MAKE IT HARDER COMPARED TO A SCHOOL WITH A MORE RECOGNIZABLE NAME LIKE NYU
THANK YOU WHAT YOU SAID HAS BEEN HELPFUL AND I FEEL BETTER ABOUT MY SITUATION NOW
I WENT TO A SMALLER LESS KNOWN UNIVERSITY FOR UNDERGRAD AND NOW I'M AT A BETTER KNOWN UNIVERSITY IN GRAD SCHOOL

THE SMALL SCHOOL GAVE ME A COZY ENVIRONMENT TO LEARN IN THERE WERE FEWER THAN A DOZEN PHYSICS FACULTY SO I WAS ABLE TO GET TO KNOW EVERY ONE OF THEM FAIRLY WELL AND ALL OF THEM WERE HAPPY TO SPEND TIME WITH ME IF I NEEDED IT

HERE AT THE BETTER KNOWN UNIVERSITY THE FOCUS IS UNAPOLOGETICALLY ON RESEARCH THE CLASS SIZES ARE AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE LARGER THIS IS A GREAT PLACE TO BE A GRADUATE STUDENT BUT IF I HAD COME HERE FOR UNDERGRAD THEN I DOUBT I WOULD HAVE LEARNED PHYSICS AS WELL AND I DON'T THINK I'D EVER HAVE LEARNED TO LOVE IT

THAT'S ONLY AN ANECDOTE OF COURSE BUT FRANKLY I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THE CORRELATION BETWEEN SCHOOL COST AND EDUCATION QUALITY IS TENUOUS AT BEST IF YOUR END GOAL IS HAVE A PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITY NAME ON YOUR RESUME GO FOR IT BUT IF YOU ASK ME YOUR PRIORITIES SHOULD BE MANAGEABLE COST AND A LOCATION ENVIRONMENT THAT YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE LIVING IN
IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT PRIVATE SCHOOLS DO CONSIDER THAT THEY MAY HAVE FINANCIAL AID FOR YOU YOU MIGHT ALSO LOOK INTO SMALL SCHOOLS A PLACE LIKE HARVEY MUDD OR WILLIAMS HAS A STRONG REPUTATION FOR SENDING STUDENTS TO GRAD SCHOOL
IN ANY SANE COUNTRY IT DOESN'T MATTER EUROPE IN FACT UNIVERSITY EDUCATION IS FREE IN MANY COUNTRIES IN GERMANY IT S FREE AGAIN
THIS IS A LITTLE MORE FOCUSED ON THE MICROCONTROLLER BUT MANY OF THE BASICS YOU MENTION ARE ALSO INVOLVED
MY E M PROFESSOR EXPLAINED THIS TO US IN HOW FAR BACK DOES IT GO WHO FIRST STARTED TELLING THIS GRIM TALE OF IMPENDING OR NOT HOW COULD ANYBODY KNOW DOOM
THE SCHRODINGER EQUATION ON THE BLACKBOARD AT IS INCORRECT
WHAT IF THE COLLAPSE ALREADY HAPPENED AND THE NEW LAWS OF PHYSICS ARE THE ONES WE ARE PERCEIVING NOW
ELI EXPERIMENTAL PHYCISIST WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF CURVATURE ON THE STABILITY OF A FALSE VACUUM IS IT POSSIBLE FOR A FALSE VACUUM TO BE THE LOWEST ENERGY STATE IN THE VICINITY OF A BLACK HOLE
I SAW THIS WHEN IT CAME OUT AND A THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ME I'M NO PHYSICIST SO PLEASE BEAR WITH MY SILLY CONJECTURES WHY DOES THE PROPOSED ENERGY STATE NEED TO BE LOWER IN ORDER FOR VACUUM DECAY TO BE A THING LET ME CLARIFY IF WERE USING GEOGRAPHICAL ANALOGY COULDN'T THERE EXIST A SECOND ENERGY VALLEY THAT'S LOCALLY STABLE BUT AT A SLIGHTLY HIGHER ENERGY LEVEL THAN WHERE THE FIELD IS CURRENTLY COULDN'T THE FIELD BE THEORETICALLY PERTURBED INTO THIS HIGHER ENERGY STATE AND REMAIN THERE UNTIL A SUFFICIENTLY STRONG STIMULUS THROWS IT OUT AGAIN WOULDN'T THIS THEN BE POSSIBLE FOR A LOT OF OTHER FIELDS AND NOT JUST THE HIGGS

I'M ASSUMING THE REASON IT CANT IS BECAUSE THE ENERGY OF THE FIELD AS A WHOLE WOULD HAVE TO INCREASE AND YOU CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT HUGE ENERGY TRANSFERS WHERE AS THE SCENARIO PROPOSED HERE IS ENERGY NEUTRAL THAT SOUNDS REASONABLE TO ME BUT I KNOW LITTLE ABOUT THE SUBJECT
TO REPEAT SOMETHING I SAID IN ANOTHER THREAD THE STATEMENT THAT WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE HIGGS FIELD IS TURNED OFF IN THE TRUE VACUUM AND STANDARD MODEL IS SUPERSEDED BY NEW PHYSICS IS WRONG THE STANDARD MODEL HANDLES THAT TRANSITION JUST FINE IT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF THE HIGGS MECHANISM THE UNIVERSE IS GOVERNED BY THE ELECTROWEAK FORCE AND MASSLESS FERMIONS WITH CHIRAL SYMMETRY YES BUT IT'S STILL WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THE STANDARD MODEL
SO THIS IS LIKE THE UNIVERSE'S BRAIN ANEURYSM IF IT EXISTS
SO LET US SAY THIS OCCURRED BILLION LIGHT YEARS AWAY AND THE NOTHING IS HURLING AT US AT LIGHT SPEED WE WOULDN'T SEE THE NOTHING COMING BUT WE SHOULD DETECT AN ANOMALOUS LACK OF STUFF THAT'S BLY AWAY DIRECTLY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE NOTHING JUST THE SAME WAY WE NOTICE BLACK HOLES AND HIGH GRAVITY GALAXIES VIA GRAVITATIONAL LENSING WE CAN'T DETECT IT DIRECTLY BUT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DETECT IT INDIRECTLY
O SORRIEST IT IS JUST THE RESET SWITCH ON THE GAME SIMULATION WE ARE ALL PART OF
THERE ARE CERTAINLY OPTICAL MICROSCOPES THAT USE LIGHT UV CONFOCAL MICROSCOPES COME TO MIND FOR HIGHER RESOLUTION BASED ON THE SHORTER WAVELENGTH THERE ARE ALSO IR MICROSCOPES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SPECTRUM THAT ARE USEFUL FOR LOOKING THROUGH THINGS THAT AREN'T TRANSPARENT IN THE VISIBLE SPECTRUM HOWEVER THESE TYPICALLY HAVE LOWER RESOLUTION BOTH DUE TO THE LONGER WAVELENGTH AND THE IR CAMERA NECESSARY TO SEE THE IMAGES

ELECTRON MICROSCOPES USE ELECTROMAGNETIC LENSES TO ACCOMPLISH BEAM FORMING AND FOCUSING OF THE ELECTRONS ALSO THE DETECTOR IS A SINGLE ELEMENT NOT AN ARRAY LIKE IN OPTICAL MICROSCOPE CAMERAS THAT IS WHY THE SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE WAS DEVELOPED TO CREATE 2D RASTER IMAGES

ANOTHER ASPECT OF USING ELECTRONS IS THAT THEY ARE CHARGED PARTICLES AND THEREFORE CAN SHOW OTHER EFFECTS LIKE CHARGING IF YOU TRY TO IMAGE A DIELECTRIC MATERIAL FOR EXAMPLE


BY FAR THE BEST RESOURCE I KNOW OF FOR A IS



BY LEONHARD SUSKIND ITS MAINLY A VIDEO SERIES BUT HE ALSO WROTE TWO BOOKS WITH THE SAME TITLE THE VIDEO LECTURES COVER ALMOST EVERY ASPECT OF MODERN PHYSICS
LECTURES IN GENERAL ARE WORTH A READ
THE ELEGANT UNIVERSE BY BRAIN GREENE
SEVEN BRIEF LESSONS ON PHYSICS BY CARLO ROVELLI
LECTURES SERIES ARE GREAT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOME FOCUSED STUDY ON THE TOPIC OF MODERN PHYSICS ITSELF THEN MODERN PHYSICS BY ARTHUR BEISER MIGHT BE HELPFUL
FOR QUANTUM MECHANICS QUANTUM REALITY IS VERY GOOD MIND BLOWING

FOR SPECIAL RELATIVITY TAYLOR AND SPACETIME PHYSICS THOUGH IT DOES CONTAIN PROBLEMS AND EQUATIONS

FOR DARK MATTER LISA DARK MATTER AND THE DINOSAURS

FOR COSMOLOGY I'D RECOMMEND VIEW FROM THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE

ALSO YOU MIGHT TRY ISAAC UNDERSTANDING PHYSICS

BUT YOUR BEST BET IS TO JUST GO TO YOUR LOCAL LIBRARY'S PHYSICS SECTION SKIM THE BOOKS OPENINGS AND PICK WHATEVER SUITS YOU THERE'S PLENTY TO CHOOSE FROM
THIS IS THE BEST TL R I COULD MAKE ORIGINAL REDUCED BY I'M A BOT

WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK ON THESE PROBLEMS AND GRADUALLY SWITCHING TOWARDS MORE APPLIED WORK LOOKING TOWARDS QUANTUM CHEMISTRY QUANTUM GENOMICS AND THINGS THAT MIGHT BE DONE ON A QUANTUM COMPUTER

IN THE PAST THE QUESTION WAS ALWAYS WHETHER SOMETHING WAS A PROBLEM WHERE A QUANTUM COMPUTER WOULD BE HYPOTHETICALLY BETTER THAN A CLASSICAL COMPUTER



EXTENDED SUMMARY FAQ VERSION TL RS SO FAR THEORY FEEDBACK AND COMMENTS ARE MONITORED CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK IS WELCOME TOP KEYWORDS QUANTUM COMPUTER 2 WORK TOPOLOGICAL MICROSOFT

HONESTLY THAT WOULD BE A RELIEF I'D FEEL BAD FOR PERLMUTTER ET AL HAS A NOBEL PRIZE EVER BEEN GIVEN IN ANY FIELD FOR RESEARCH THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY DISPUTED INVALIDATED DO THEY GET AN AWKWARD CALL FROM SWEEDEN EARLY IN THE MORNING
THIS MIGHT BE OVERSIMPLIFYING THINGS BUT IF COSMOLOGY IS STILL HINGED ON QUESTIONABLE DISTANCE MEASURES THAT SHOULD PROBABLY BE THE TOP OF OUR PRIORITY LIST

WHY NOT SEND OUT 2 OR SMALL SPACE TELESCOPES INTO OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS SAY TO L1 AND L3 AND USE VERY VERY LONG BASELINE INTERFEROMETRY TO FINALLY NAIL DOWN SOME DISTANCES THEN WE COULD CALIBRATE ALL THESE STANDARD CANDLES
CB MEASUREMENTS ALONE GIVE STRONG EVIDENCE FOR DARK ENERGY NO SUPERNOVAE NEEDED

UNDERGRAD VERY LITTLE
ALL THE TIME
I'M IN NOW AND THE ANSWER IS DEFINITELY TOO MANY I DON'T THINK YOU DO NEED A REFERENCE THOUGH IT'S HOWEVER MANY IT TAKES TO MASTER THE MATERIAL UP TO THE LIMIT OF HOWEVER LONG YOU'RE AWAKE
BSC WAS HOURS PER WEEK DURING SEMESTER AND HOURS PER WEEK IN THE WEEKS LEADING UP TO THE EXAMS

MSC WAS EASILY HOURS PER WEEK WITH ABOUT OF THE WEEKS BEING BUT I DID COURSEWORK PLUS RESEARCH FROM THE GET GO SO THIS WAS NOT EXACTLY HOW THE UNIVERSITY ENVISIONED IT USUALLY THE FIRST YEAR OF THE MSC IS SUPPOSED TO BE ONLY COURSEWORK
NOW IT'S SOMEWHERE BETWEEN AND DEPENDING ON SCHEDULE ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE DREAMTIME SCHEDULED AT A SYNCHROTRON THE WEEKS BEFORE THAT ARE ALWAYS VERY TAXING

MOST POSTDOCS I KNOW WORK AT LEAST HOURS PER WEEK ALL YEAR AND WILL WORK DURING THEIR HOLIDAYS AND WEEKENDS NO IDEA HOW THEIR FAMILIES ARE OKAY WITH THIS ALSO THE REASON WHY I WON'T CONTINUE AFTER MY PHD EVEN THOUGH I LOVE PHYSICS AND DOING RESEARCH

EDIT
I SHOULD ADD THAT THIS KIND OF WORKLOAD DURING BACHELOR AND MASTER ARE NOT EXACTLY NECESSARY TO DO WELL IN PHYSICS I WAS AMONG THE BEST OF THE CLASS IN BASICALLY ALL MY COURSES DUE TO THE TIME I PUT INTO LEARNING IF YOU'RE OKAY EVEN WITH HAVING JUST GOOD MARKS INSTEAD OF NEAR PERFECT SCORES YOU CAN REDUCE THE WORKLOAD QUITE A BIT
AND AS A FINAL REMARK THIS COMES FROM SOMEONE IN GERMANY I HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH OF THIS IS APPLICABLE TO OTHER COUNTRIES
IT INCREASES STEADILY AS YOU PROGRESS DURING MY MASTERS I WAS EASILY DOING HOURS A WEEK TO KEEP UP WITH COURSEWORK ASSIGNMENTS AND RESEARCH
UNDERGRAD I AVOIDED LECTURES AND SPENT THE TIME WATCHING ANIME AND PLAYING GAMES AND CRAMMED TOWARD THE END SO LIKE NORMALLY HALF AN HOUR EACH DAY AT MOST AS A BASELINE AND THEN WHATEVER TIME IT TOOK TO COMPLETE ASSIGNMENTS I DIDN'T REALLY STUDY EXCEPT FOR EXAMS JUST DID ASSESSMENTS WORKED OUT FINE THEN AGAIN MY DEGREES WERE EASIER THAN MANY OTHERS MADE NO DIFFERENCE FOR PHD THOUGH SINCE WE HAVE NO DUALS ALSO MADE NO DIFFERENCE IN RESEARCH REALLY HOURS DEPENDS ON YOUR LEARNING STYLE AND PARTICULAR COURSES SO YOU SHOULDN'T TAKE GUIDELINES TOO SERIOUSLY
FINISHING MY UNDERGRAD NOW SPEND MAYBE 2 HOURS A WEEK STUDYING TO ON THE LEAD-UP TO A TESTAMENT E M HAD ME STUDYING A WEEK BUT THAT WAS REALLY THE OUTLIER CURRENTLY STUDYING FOR THE GRE AND AM SPENDING A WEEK JUST ON THAT PLANNING ON DOUBLING OR TRIPLING THAT THIS WEEK BECAUSE THE TEST IS IN DAYS
RULE OF THUMB IS THAT YOU SHOULD SPEND AS MUCH TIME ON YOUR MODULES OUT OF YOUR LECTURES AS YOU HAVE TIMETABLE SO IF YOU HAVE 2 HOURS OF GENERAL RELATIVITY A WEEK THEN YOU SHOULD SPEND AT LEAST 2 HOURS STUDYING IT A WEEK BUT HONESTLY I DON'T THINK THAT'S ENOUGH ESPECIALLY IN THE LATER YEARS I'D SUGGEST SOMETHING LIKE HOURS AT LEAST OUTSIDE OF EACH MODULE

I'M IN MY 4TH YEAR NOW SO I ONLY HAVE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AT UNI
CURRENTLY AN UNDERGRAD I STUDY ALMOST NON STOP IF YOU CONSIDER DOING HOMEWORK STUDYING EASILY OVER HOURS OF HOMEWORK PER WEEK
MANY
DOUBLED IN MATH SO THIS MAY SKEW YOUR STATS OF MY TIME WAS SPENT ON MATHEMATICS AS THE COURSES GOT HARDER MY STUDYING DIDN'T CHANGE MUCH IN GRAD SCHOOL I STUDIED A BIT MORE ON AVERAGE ABOUT THREE HOURS A DAY FIVE HOURS ON SATURDAYS TOOK SUNDAY'S OFFICIAL
I'M AN UNDERGRAD RIGHT NOW AND SPEND ABOUT HOURS ON EACH CLASS PER WEEK SO HOURS I USED TO BE ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH DOING HOMEWORK AN HOUR BEFORE CLASS AND NOT STUDYING FRESHMAN AND SOPHOMORE YEARS BUT UPPER LEVEL THERMO MECHANICS E M IS MUCH MORE INVOLVED AND FASTER PACED MISSING A SINGLE LECTURE IS A DISASTER QM WAS OVERRATED THOUGH THE CONCEPTS ARE DIFFICULT BUT I THINK THE SPEED OF INSTRUCTION IS SLOW ENOUGH THAT THEY WERE SOME OF MY EASIER CLASSES
I FEEL LIKE IT WAS HOURS A DAY DURING THE WEEK AND ANYWHERE FROM ON WEEKENDS KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS WAS PRIMARILY DEDICATED TO DOING HOMEWORK PROJECTS STUDYING IN PHYSICS IS MOSTLY WORKING PROBLEMS
IN MY UNIVERSITY PHYSICS STUDENTS ARE USUALLY SPENDING ABOUT TO HOURS A WEEK TO STUDY READ WORK HOMEWORK PROBLEMS AND DIGEST MOST O THE MATERIAL OF COURSE THERE IS A HUGE JUMP FROM FRESHMAN YEAR TO JUNIOR YEAR

USUALLY THE FIRST CLASS TO REALLY KICK OUR STUDY HABITS INTO GEAR IS THEORETICAL METHODS FOR PHYSICISTS I THAT CLASS WAS THE FIRST INTENSE COURSE I TOOK IN UNI
I BASICALLY STUDY HOURS A DAY I'D SAY I'D LOVE TO MAKE IT BUT I HAVE TO WORK DURING TESTING PERIODS AND ASSIGNMENTS I CAN EASILY WORK STRAIGHT HOURS THOUGH
AVERAGE PER DAY MAY GET YOU WANT YOU WANT EXAMPLE I PROBABLY STUDIED BETWEEN PER DAY NOT INCLUDING CLASSES UNFORTUNATELY THAT WAS CONCENTRATED IN ONE OR TWO DAYS INSTEAD OF SPREAD OVER THE WEEK YOU HEAR OFTEN THAT CRAMMING ISN'T GOOD HERE IS ANOTHER DATA POINT TO THAT

I DID MY UNDERGRAD IN PHYSICS I SPENT ABOUT AN HOUR A WEEK IN THE FIRST YEAR MECHANICS INTRO EM BUT ONCE WE STARTED ANALYTICAL MECHANICS AND UPPER DIV EM I HAD TO DO ABOUT HOURS A WEEK TO STAY ON TOP OF THE MATERIAL

E HOURS FOR EACH CLASS NOT IN TOTAL

THIS IS LIKE YEARS OLD
HAVEN'T ATOMIC FORCE MICROSCOPES BEEN AROUND SINCE THE WHY DID IT TAKE UNTIL TO TAKE AN IMAGE BEFORE AND AFTER A REACTION OR WERE THEY JUST NOT CLEAR ENOUGH UNTIL THEN
HERE'S A DESCRIPTION OF A RELATED STUDY THAT USED THE TECHNIQUE TO IMAGE ORBITALS IN THE THE HYDROGEN ATOM THE RADIAL PEAKS AREN'T QUITE AS HIGH AS YOU'D INTUITIVELY EXPECT FROM THE RADIAL PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION BUT IT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE
DOES THIS RESEMBLE WHAT AN ATOM WOULD LOOK LIKE IF WE COULD SEE VISIBLE LIGHT

STEPHEN POLLOCK
I FIRST READ WHILE THIS ARGUMENT IS NOT COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS
YOU WAVED YOUR HANDS SO HARD IT CREATED PHYSICS
IS THIS JUST A STYLE THING TO OMIT THE PUNCTUATION IN EQUATIONS I THOUGHT IT WAS GENERALLY THE CASE THAT YOU SHOULD INCLUDE IT BUT THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF THINGS THAT WERE PRESCRIBED TO ME AS FACT WHICH WERE IN REALITY A RESULT OF STYLE

EITHER WAY I JUST FEEL INCREDIBLY UNSETTLED BY THE LACK OF PUNCTUATION THERE
I SAW A TALK FROM THE AUTHOR OF THIS PAPER WHO SAID THAT HE CALLED THE PONYTAILS FIBER BUNDLES JUST TO PISS OF MATHEMATICIANS
MATHEMATICIAN ISN'T YOUR ACTUALLY ABEL SUMMATION I'M PRETTY SURE THE TERM ONLY APPLIES WHEN THERE'S A ZETA FUNCTION INVOLVED
I REMEMBER WHEN MY ELECTROMAGNETISM PROFESSOR WAS DERIVING SOMETHING ON THE BOARD HE STOPPED LOOKED AROUND SAID I'M CHECKING FOR MATHEMATICIANS AND THEN DID SOME FUNNY MATHS
SO IN GENERAL ARE YOU ALLOWED TO REPLACE A SUM WITH THE ANALYTICALLY CONTINUED VALUE JUST BECAUSE IT'S CONSISTENT WITH OBSERVATION OR IS THERE A MORE FUNDAMENTAL REASON I EAST WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT FUNCTION IS ANALYTIC
I'LL ALLOW IT
COOL STUFF BUT AREN'T THERE PLENTY OF LESS DUBIOUS WAYS TO GET

FOR EXAMPLE REQUIRING THE CENTRAL CHARGE TO VANISH IN THE WORLDSHEET SAFT GIVES
MY FAVORITE INFINITE SUM IS COUNTING HOW MANY INTEGERS THERE ARE THAT IS

S SUM N NIFTY NIFTY

OF COURSE SINCE THE SUMMAND IS EVEN AROUND WE CAN JUST WRITE THIS AS

S 2 SUM N NIFTY

AND EVERYONE KNOWS HOW TO DO THIS LAST SUM

SUM N NIFTY ZETA FAC 2

SO WE HAVE

S 2 TIMES LEFT FAC 2 RIGHT

ZERO THERE ARE ZERO INTEGERS

IN ALL SERIOUSNESS ZETA REGULARIZATION RESULTS IN ZERO SO OFTEN THAT IT REALLY IS THE BEST REGULATOR IT'S BASICALLY BECAUSE IT KILLS ALL OF YOUR POWER DIVERGENCES BASICALLY IT RENORMALIZE FOR YOU ONLY LEAVING THE INTERESTING PARTS OF THE CALCULATION I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES I'VE USED

I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW THE NAME OF THE FONT USED ON MATHEMATICAL PAPERS WHAT'S THE NAME OF IT I'VE SEEN IT SO MANY TIMES IN PAPERS EXAMS ETC
DUDE I'VE BEEN STUCK ON MY OWN THESIS FOR THE LAST THREE MONTHS BECAUSE I CAN'T SATISFY MYSELF THAT MY EXPLANATIONS ARE CLEAR ENOUGH I TRY TO EXPLAIN EACH AND EVERY LITTLE APPROXIMATION ASSUMPTION WHERE IT COMES FROM WHO MADE IT FIRST WHO DISAGREES WITH IT ETC ETC I EVEN DEDICATE A PARAGRAPH IN MY INTRODUCTION TO THIS PROCESS OF TRYING TO FIND THE ANSWER AND EXPLANATION WHEN AN ANSWER AND EXPLANATION WOULD SUFFICE IT'S HARD TO DRAW THE LINE AND I SOMETIMES FEEL LIKE I'M DROWNING AND THAT ANYBODY READING MY THESIS WILL JUST LOOK AT IT AND GO BAH LOOK AT THIS JACKASS HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT X


SO WHAT IS THE MASS OF A SPHERICAL COW
YOU'RE A MONSTER
I HAVE NO IDEA WHY I'M SUBSCRIBED TO THIS SUB I'VE NEVER EVEN TAKEN PHYSICS IN HIGH SCHOOL LET ALONE GONE TO UNIVERSITY
I'M NOT SCARED STANDS FOOLISHLY IN HERO STANCE
TO BE FAIR ALL OF THAT CAN BE MADE COMPLETELY RIGOROUS BUT PHYSICISTS DON'T MUCH CARE FOR THAT SINCE THEY ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWER

R UNEXPECTEDEXPONENT
I'VE NEVER SEEN THE WORD INSISTING USED IN A PAPER LIKE THIS

INSISTING THE TOTAL APE IS EQUAL TO RESULTS IN

I LOVE IT AND HATE IT
DIDN'T YOU FORGET A BAR IN YOUR HAMILTONIAN
THANKS FOR SHARING I THINK MOST MATHEMATICIANS ARE WELL AWARE OF THIS SUM BUT PERSONALLY I'M MUCH MORE SCARED BY STRING THEORY'S LACK OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
I FEEL THERE'S A VERONICA ROTH JOKE TO BE MADE HERE SOMEWHERE
SPRYLY GHAST EASY SHIT GIMME A BREAK
ARE HAMILTONIAN HERE RELATED TO GRAPH THEORY
IS THERE A CONDENSATE DESCRIPTION DYNAMIC POSSIBLY OF THE HARMONIC OSCILLATORS SHIFTING THE ENERGY
THIS ISN'T SO HORRIBLE I'VE PROBABLY READ A BIT MORE ABOUT PHYSICS THAN YOUR AVERAGE MATHEMATICIAN BUT AFTER LOOKING UP A COUPLE OF TERMS I CAN MAKE SENSE OF IT
WHY DO YOU INSIST THAT THE TOTAL APE IS EQUAL TO
SO GOES TO

IT'S BACK TO THE BOOKS WITH ME I GUESS
UNSUBSCRIBED
COMPUTER MODERN IS UGLY AS HELL AND YOU SHOULD PICK SOME OTHER FONT FOR YOUR THESIS TRY PALATINE
THE FINAL PARAGRAPH EXPLAINS HOW WEAK OF AN ATTEMPT THIS IS TO CONFIRM A PREEXISTING NOTION BY RELEGATING IT TO A MATHEMATICAL AESTHETIC
I STUDIED IN UNI BUT INTERESTED LEARNING PHYSICS IN MY SPARE TIME I NEED TEXTBOOK THAT I CAN READ FRONT TO BACK BESIDE THAT I ALSO WATCHING MIT ACW PHYSICS DDX BERKELEY WEBCAST WHICH PHYSICS TEXTBOOK FOR SELF STUDY SHOULD I PICK

PHYSICS FOR SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS A STRATEGIC APPROACH BY KNIGHT

UNIVERSITY PHYSICS WITH MODERN PHYSICS BY YOUNG FREEDMAN

PHYSICS FOR SCIENTIST AND ENGINEERS WITH MODERN PHYSICS BY SEAWAY JEWETT
WHAT'S THE BEST BOOK TO SELF LEARN UPPER DIVISION QUANTUM FROM I WILL NOT HAVE TIME TO TAKE IT BEFORE GRADUATING AND WOULD LIKE TO COVER THE MATERIAL BEFORE GOING INTO GRAD SCHOOL I HAVE GRIFFITHS AND I'M NOT A BIG FAN AS HE TENDS TO GLOSS OVER IMPORTANT IDEAS SOMETIMES
I'M DOING PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS AND SPHERICAL EQUATIONS IN MY SECOND YEAR MATHS MODULE IN A PHYSICS COURSE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS ON BOOKS
WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO SEE SOME IMAGES FROM THIS LENS ARRAY
IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE ATTRACTED TO INDUSTRY IT'S THAT WE'RE TURNED OFF OF ACADEMIA I WOULD HAVE ATTEMPTED THAT TRACK HAD THEN BEEN MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR A SECURE FUTURE WITH JOB HOPPING AND HOPING FOR TENURE
THE FACT IS UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS ARE TAKING ON MORE STUDENTS FASTER THAN THERE ARE ACADEMIC POSITIONS IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING INDUSTRY CAN BE VERY INTERESTING

IT DOES HINT AT A BIT OF A PROBLEM FOR UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS IF YOU ASK ME UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS ARE INCREASINGLY BEING SEEN AS ROADMAPS TO THE ELUSIVE JOB WHEN THEY WERE DESIGNED TO BE ROADMAPS TO KNOWLEDGE COMING OUT OF A BACHELOR OF SOMETHING DOES NOT REALLY TRAIN YOU FOR ANYTHING SPECIFIC EXCEPT HOW TO ATTAIN FURTHER KNOWLEDGE NOR SHOULD IT THERE ARE A TON OF GREAT TRADE SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES AVAILABLE FOR THAT SORT OF THING

THAT BEING SAID PHYSICS GRADS GENERALLY DO WELL IN INDUSTRY THEY ARE CLEVER RESOURCEFUL AND INDEPENDENT THEY ALSO GENERALLY TAKE JOBS THAT DO NOT EXPLICITLY CALL FOR PHYSICISTS SO IT MAY SEEM THAT THERE ARE NO JOBS AVAILABLE FOR PHYSICISTS WHEN THE REAL ISSUE IS PHYSICISTS ARE NOT TRAINED HOW TO PROPERLY SELL THEIR SKILLS TO EMPLOYERS
RESUBMITTED BECAUSE OF A MISLEADING TITLE

THE JOINT TASK FORCE ON UNDERGRADUATE PHYSICS RELEASED A REPORT TO HELP PHYSICS PRESUMABLY UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS BETTER PREPARE STUDENTS FOR CAREERS AFTER GRADUATION FULL REPORT CAN BE FOUND HERE

THE ARTICLE STATES JUST OF US PHYSICS BACHELOR STUDENTS PURSUE A CAREER AS A PHYSICIST BUT THE ARTICLE CLARIFIES THAT THIS REFERS TO THOSE THAT BECOME A PHYSICS PROFESSOR I DON'T THINK IT INCLUDES PHYSICISTS IN INDUSTRY OR NATIONAL LABS

OTHER HIGHLIGHTS

PHYSICS TRAINING NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED TO PREPARE PHYSICS GRADUATES FOR JOBS THIS INCLUDES DEEPER KNOWLEDGE OF COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS TOOLS EXPERIENCE WITH APPLIED AND DEVELOPMENTAL WORK AND PROFESSIONAL WORKPLACE SKILLS

OF PHYSICS PH D RECIPIENTS END UP IN ACADEMIC CAREERS SO EVEN STUDENTS PLANNING ON OBTAINING GRADUATE DEGREES BENEFIT FROM SKILLETS

RECOMMENDS THAT PHYSICS PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONAL SOCIETIES PLACE GREATER EMPHASIS ON PROJECTS AND CAREERS THAT ARE MORE APPLIED AND RELEVANT TO INDUSTRY
BECAUSE THAT SEEMS LIKE THE MOST IT CAN SUPPORT I'VE PRETTY MUCH SETTLED ON GOING INTO THE WORKFORCE INSTEAD OF DOING GRAD SCHOOL ASSUMING I GET A REASONABLE OFFER
HEY I GRADUATED WITH A BS IN HAVE NOT WORKED IN THE FIELD SO I HAVE ANY OPTIONS TO GET INTO A SCIENCE CAREER BE BRUTALLY HONEST
YOU NEED TO WRITE DOWN A BASIS OF THE STATE SPACE WHICH IS A VECTOR SPACE THEN YOU CAN WRITE DOWN ANY STATE AS A LINEAR COMBINATION OF THESE VECTORS AND YOU CAN WRITE DOWN ANY OPERATOR ACTING ON THE STATE SPACE AS A MATRIX

THE REST OF WHAT YOU WANT TO DO THEN BECOMES LINEAR ALGEBRA

JUST AN EXAMPLE PAULI MATRICES THE STATE SPACE IS TWO DIMENSIONAL OVER THE COMPLEX NUMBERS CHOOSE THE Z DIRECTION TAKE SPIN UP AS AND SPIN DOWN AS THEN THE SX SY AND S OPERATORS LOOK LIKE THIS

CONCEPTUAL BREAKTHROUGHS ARE FAR HARDER TO PREDICT THAN EXPERIMENTAL CONFIRMATIONS SO WHO THE HELL KNOWS WHAT FORM THOSE WILL TAKE IF I KNEW WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE I WOULD BE WRITING UP A PAPER NOT A REDDIN POST BUT HOPEFULLY SOME GENIUS WILL FIGURE OUT QUANTUM GRAVITY DARK MATTER AND OR DARK ENERGY PERHAPS THEY'RE EVEN ALL RELATED TO ONE KEY MISCONCEPTION IN OUR CURRENT FORMALISMS
AFTER MIT'S RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT OF 2 ATM PLASMA PRESSURE IN THEIR TEST REACTOR I'M POSITIVE WE'LL SEE FUSION REACTORS OUTPUT MORE ENERGY THAN INPUT IT WAS ALWAYS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN WITH ITER WHENEVER THAT COMPLETES BUT IT WAS A SIGNIFICANT MILESTONE

I AM CONFUSED A BIT IF I AM UNDERSTANDING CORRECTLY YOU'RE AN UNDERGRAD LOOKING TO DO A RESEARCH PROJECT ESSENTIALLY THIS SOUNDS LIKE YOU'D BE SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF A LIT REVIEW ESPECIALLY IN SOME OF THE MENTIONED FIELDS ALSO BEAR IN MIND THAT TERMS LIKE CONDENSED MATTER ENCOMPASSES AN INCREDIBLY WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS

SOME UNIVERSITIES U SOUTH AT LEAST OFFER AN ACTUAL COURSE DISTINCTION THAT IS CALLED DIRECT STUDY OR SOMETHING SIMILAR THAT ALLOWS YOU FOCUS ON A PROJECT JUST LIKE THIS WHILE GETTING CREDIT FOR IT
I WANT TO BELIEVE
CAN WE RENAME PLUTO TO SOMETHING ELSE AND NAME PLANET NINE AS PLUTO JUST FOR SAKE
PLANETS AD YOU HAD ANOTHER KID AND NEVER TOLD US
SUN I
IN KEEPING WITH THE ROMAN GOD THEME I THINK THEY SHOULD CALL IT ORCUS OR MINERVA
EXCELLENT QUESTION THE FACT IS BASICALLY ALL THEORIES ARE LIKE THIS THIS WASN'T ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD EINSTEIN HIMSELF HAD BEEN HORRIBLY CONFUSED ABOUT IT UNTIL OVER A YEAR AFTER HE HAD DISCOVERED GENERAL RELATIVITY HE NEEDED A MATHEMATICIAN TO EXPLAIN THIS TO HIM ACTUALLY PEOPLE ARE STILL CONFUSED ABOUT IT TO THIS DAY BUT FEWER PEOPLE ARE THE LESSON HAS SLOWLY BEEN SINKING IN OVER THE LAST CENTURY

THE REAL LESSON OF GENERAL RELATIVITY IS THIS WHILE OTHER THEORIES ARE ACTUALLY INVARIANT UNDER GENERAL COORDINATE TRANSFORMATIONS SIMPLY BECAUSE COORDINATE TRANSFORMATIONS DON'T ACTUALLY CHANGE ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR COORDINATES GENERAL RELATIVITY BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT IT HAS A DYNAMIC GEOMETRY WAS THE FIRST THEORY TO REQUIRE A FORMULATION
AS YOU INTUITED ALL SENSIBLE THEORIES ARE INVARIANT UNDER CHANGE OF COORDINATES

WHAT MAKES GENERAL RELATIVITY SPECIAL THOUGH IS THAT THE MATHEMATICAL FORMULAE DON'T CHANGE UNDER COORDINATE CHANGES FOR EXAMPLE SECOND LAW IS

F MA

IN AN INERTIAL FRAME BUT

F MA MA

FOR A FRAME WITH ACCELERATION A THIS MEANS THAT LAWS WHILE PREDICTING THE SAME EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS REGARDLESS OF COORDINATES CAN SELECT SOME AS PREFERRED BASED ON YOUR OWN NOTIONS OF SIMPLICITY

GENERAL RELATIVITY HAS NONE OF THAT THE ENTIRE THEORY THE ACTION IS CONSTRUCTED AS TO HAVE A MATHEMATICAL FORM THAT DOESN'T CHANGE WHENEVER YOU CHANGE COORDINATES AND AS SUCH HAS NO PREFERRED FRAME A PRIORI THIS MIGHT SEEM IRRELEVANT BUT IT ALLOWS SPACETIME TO BE A PHYSICAL ACTOR IN ITS OWN RIGHT WHICH MEANS IT CAN EVOLVE DYNAMICALLY
THAT TITLE JUST GOT ME EXCITED
THAT'S GONNA TAKE ME A FEW WATCHES AS A FIRST YEAR COLLEGE
AS HAVING JUST BEEN MOLESTED BY MY QUANTUM TEST I'M RELUCTANT TO VIEW THIS HAHA
DID I GET IT RIGHT IF THIS METHOD WORKS OUT IT WOULD UNIFY QM AND GR AND EXPLAIN DARK ENERGY

EDIT AUTOINCORRECT
WHAT DOES THE SETH LLOYD IDEA DISCUSSED IN THE VIDEO IMPLY THE INFINITE DECOHERENCE HISTORIES OF A STATIC WAVE FUNCTION DOES IT REPRESENT MULTIVERSE
SO I'VE TAKEN QUANTUM I'M TAKING REAL ANALYSIS RIGHT NOW AND HOLY COW THIS VIDEO SPARKS MENTAL CONNECTIONS BETWEEN PHYSICS AND MATH FOR MPH
HELLO

I JUST STARTED STUDYING PHYSICS IN GERMANY

IM A BIT WORRIED SINCE ITS MY FIRST SEMESTER 2 WEEKS IN AND I FEEL LIKE ITS WAY TOO HARD

IS THIS NORMAL TRANSITION FROM SCHOOL TO UNIVERSITY I HAD VERY GOOD MATH AND PHYSICS GRADES IN SCHOOL

AND SOMETIMES I EVEN DOUBT MYSELF IF MY DECISION WAS RIGHT

ANYONE HAS TIPS
I WANT TO START APPLYING FOR GRAD SCHOOLS BUT I AM NOT A CONVENTIONAL STUDENT I HAVE A B A IN PHYSICS AN MASCULINE SOUTH IN ANOTHER FIELD ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE MY GENERAL GRE SCORES EXPIRED BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE TO RETAKE IT SINCE I HAVE A MASTERS I DON'T HAVE ALL OF THE REQUIRED PHYSICS CLASSES SO I DON'T KNOW IF I AM EVEN QUALIFIED CONSIDERED I FIGURE I CAN'T GET ALL MY QUESTIONS ANSWERED HERE SO WHAT'S A GOOD RESOURCE TO ANSWER SPECIFIC QUESTIONS SHOULD I JUST CALL THE SCHOOL S I AM INTERESTED IN
DOES ANYONE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT GOOD RESEARCH IN STRING THEORY IN CANADA I'LL BE APPLYING FOR MY MASTERS SOON AND I'M INTERESTED IN STUDYING IT

I'VE ALREADY LOOKED AT SCHOOLS LIKE UBC MCGILL BUT I WAS WONDERING IF ANYONE KNEW ABOUT ANY GOOD PLACES THAT MAY NOT BE SO OBVIOUS

THANKS
DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE AN IMPACT ON YOUR FIELD

DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE MAKING SIGNIFICANT SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS

I'M SUPER INTERESTED IN PHYSICS BUT I'VE BEEN DISCOURAGED LATELY I FEEL THAT ANYTHING LESS THAN A PHD WILL MEAN THAT I'LL HAVE LITTLE TO NO IMPACT ON WHATEVER FIELD I'M IN AND THUS WON'T FIND MY WORK FULFILLING
IM LOOKING FOR A FIELD TO GO INTO AS I AM APPROACHING JUNIOR SENIOR YEAR

I QUICKLY FOUND OUT FRESHMAN YEAR THAT PROGRAMMING ISNT NECISSARILLY MY STRONG SUIT AND AFTER WORKING AS A TEACHERS ASSISTANT I DEVELOPED A LOVE FOR EXPERIMENTAL TYPE PHYSICS

I REALLY LIKE OPTICS BECAUSE ITS VARY HANDS ON BUT A LOT OF THE FIELDS I AM HEARING ABOUT SEEM VERY COMPUTER AND PROGRAMMING HEAVY

THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME TO READ THIS
ANY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GETTING PHD IN YOUR VS
WRITING SAMPLES OF STATEMENTS OF PURPOSE INVOLVING MENTAL DISORDERS

I HAVE A MENTAL DISORDER THAT FUCKED UP MY GRADES IN MY BSC IN SOME STEM COURSE WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE PHYSICS I'M WORKING FULL TIME AND WANT TO APPLY FOR PHD OR MSC IN PHYSICS I READ ABOUT ADVICE ON HOW TO WRITE STATEMENTS OF PURPOSE FOR GRADUATE SCHOOL APPLICATIONS NOT JUST PHYSICS FOR ANY SUCH AS MSC MA PHD MBA LAW OR MEDICINE INVOLVING MENTAL DISORDERS BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY ACTUAL SAMPLES WHERE CAN I FIND SOME IF YOU HAVE A DISABILITY AND MADE A STATEMENT OF PURPOSE MENTIONING YOUR DISABILITY I WOULD VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IF YOU SHOWED IT TO ME I WOULD DEFINITELY KEEP IT CONFIDENTIAL ALTHOUGH YOU COULD JUST DELETE YOUR NAME AND CHANGE SOME OF THE DATES OR DETAILS OR SOMETHING
HELLO

I'M CURRENTLY STUDYING AN ENGINEERING AGRONOMICAL CAREER BUT I STILL CONSIDER I COULD CHANGE TO ANOTHER ONE
I HAVE A FEELING THAT MAYBE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE WHICH IS IF I CHOOSE PHYSICS WHICH I LIKE AS A CAREER I'LL MISS NOT TAKING CHEMISTRY MAINLY AND ALSO MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCES AND ADD A LOT OF CAREERS EVERYONE MAYBE PHILOSOPHY GOES IN THERE AS WELL FOR ME


SO I HAVE A QUESTION THOUGH I DON'T THINK AT ALL THERE WOULD BE AN ANSWER BUT

IS THERE A REASON TO SAY YOU'D PERSONALLY SAY YOU WOULD TAKE PHYSICS OVER CHEMISTRY
ANY OTHER PHYSICS MAJORS WANT TO WEIGH IN ON WHETHER TAKING TWO PHYSICS COURSES SIMULTANEOUSLY IS POSSIBLE

MY COLLEGE IS OFFERING OPTICS QM AND CLASSIC MECH NEXT SEMESTER OPTICS MIGHT BE REALLY FUN IT'LL BE A COURSE BUT I'M EMBARRASSED BY MY LACK OF QM CREDENTIALS CLASSIC MECH IS ONLY OFFERED ONCE EVERY THREE SEMESTERS BUT I HAVE TIME TO PUT IT OFF IF NECESSARY

DOES ANYONE THINK QM OPTICS IS FEASIBLE OR MIGHT THE WORKLOAD BE TOO MUCH FOR A SINGLE SEMESTER WHILE MY COURSES ARE AN ABSOLUTE BREEZE I'M CURRENTLY GRAPPLING WITH STAYING AFLOAT WITH JUST A SINGLE PHYSICS COURSE THIS SEMESTER
HELLO HOPE THIS ISN'T TOO LATE TO GET A RESPONSE

MY UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE IS IN DISCRETE MATHEMATICS AND I AM MIDWAY THROUGH A MASTERS IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE I HAVE DONE RESEARCH IN SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING AND WOULD LIKE TO SWITCH TO THIS FIELD SPECIFICALLY COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS AND FINISH A PHD AS YOU MAY NOTICE MY MATH BACKGROUND IS NOT IN AN AREA THAT IS TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH PHYSICS DOES ANYONE HERE HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE COMING FROM A SIMILAR BACKGROUND AND GOING INTO PHYSICS OR SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING IN GENERAL ANY ADVICE ON THIS AND MATERIALS TO FILL OUT MY MATHEMATICS KNOWLEDGE WOULD BE WELCOME

THANKS IN ADVANCE
HI THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE WRITTEN SOME TIME AGO AND WAS WONDERING IF IT WAS CORRECT TO PUT THINGS THIS WAY I'D APPRECIATE IT IF ANYONE HELPED POINT OUT MISTAKES IN MY UNDERSTANDING
YOU DIDNT ACTUALLY SHOW ANYTHING ABOUT AND BEING THE PROBABILITIES TO FIND THE SYSTEM IS STATE AND STATE 2 YOU SHOWED THAT THE NORM OF THE WAVEFUNCTION IS THE SUM OF THE NORMS OF THE COEFFICIENTS WHICH MUST BE SET TO SO ARE COMPLEX NUMBERS LYING WITHIN THE UNIT DISCOURSE BUT THAT BY ITSELF DOESN'T IMPLY ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT AND REPRESENT

WHAT YOU SHOULD LOOK AT ARE THE PROJECTIONS OF THE WAVEFUNCTION IN THE PSI AND PSI 2 SUBSPACES
MAYBE I'M AN IDIOT BUT THIS LOOKS LIKE SOME KIND OF A EXPANSION FOR WEAK COUPLING BETWEEN THE SUBSTRATE AND MOLECULES YOUR TRANSITION FROM ONE MOLECULAR STATE TO ANOTHER HAS TO BE MEDIATED BY THE SUBSTRATE

SO YOU START WITH THE EIGENBASIS OF THE MOLECULES AND TO FIND THE PROBABILITY OF TRANSITION FROM EIGENSTATE N TO EIGENSTATE M YOU SUM OVER ALL THE POSSIBLE INTERMEDIATE STATES WHICH HAPPEN TO BE ALL OF THE EXCITATIONS OF THE SUBSTRATE EACH OF THESE HAS TO BE WEIGHTED BY THE PROPAGATOR FOR AN EXCITATION FROM AVERAGE ENERGY EPSILON TO THE EXCITATION ENERGY EPSILON S

BY THAT LOGIC SUMMING THESE GUYS REALLY RELIES ON YOU BEING ABLE TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT EPSILON S IN THE FEYNMAN DIAGRAMS CASE THE ENERGY OF A EXCITATION OF ENERGY EPSILON IS WELL-KNOWN IT'S JUST K MU K MU WHERE K MU IS THE MOMENTUM

SO ALTHOUGH I CAN'T POINT YOU TO AN EXPLICIT REFERENCE THESE KIND OF THINGS SHOULD DEFINITELY BE CALCULABLE FOR SOMETHING LIKE A SUBSTRATE THAT'S A FREE 2D ELECTRON GAS THE PROPAGATOR THERE IS SIMPLE AND THIS BASICALLY BOILS DOWN TO SOME FEYNMAN DIAGRAMS AKA SOME SIMPLE INTEGRALS

EDIT AND AS ANOTHER IDEA THIS SUM IS A KIND OF MATSUBARA SUM SO IF YOU REALLY WANT TO USE A MODEL WHERE THERE'S A DISCRETE SET OF EXCITATION ENERGIES THEN YOU CAN CONVERT THIS SUM TO SOME KIND OF INTEGRAL IN THE COMPLEX ENERGY PLANE I BET
MAYBE A PENDULUM
THE IDEA OF USING MOTION OF A THROWN PARTICLE CAME INTO MY MIND WOULD BE PRETTY IMPRACTICAL AND NOT VERY ACCURATE LIKE YOU CAN MEASURE HOW FAR YOU THROW A BALL YOU CAN TAKE A GOOD GUESS AT WHAT ANGLE YOU THROW IT AT BUT YOU CAN'T KNOW WHAT FORCE YOU THROW IT WITH
HM MAYBE MEASURE THE FALL OF OBJECTS UNDER WATER
KNOW ANY CALCULUS THERE ARE SOME FUN THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH LIMITS TO CALCULATE GRAVITY
VERY COOL GOOD THINKING MAKING IT DO SOMETHING WITHOUT ENTERING REAL DATA
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY PURE RESEARCH PAPER YOUR INSTITUTION LIBRARY SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO MOST JOURNALS FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS ARTICLES
MAN REDDIN REALLY NEEDS A TEX INTERPRETER
P I P M 2

P I IS THE AND M IS THE MASSACHUSETTS THE FACT THAT ARE CONSERVED AND PRODUCTS OF THEM ARE INVARIANT MAKES RELATIVISTIC KINEMATICS EXTREMELY EASY TO ME THIS IS A VERY NICE PIECE OF THEORY BUT ALSO SOMETHING I USE FREQUENTLY IN EXPERIMENT SO WHILE IT'S A SIMPLE EQUATION AND OBVIOUS TO MOST WHO'VE SEEN SR IT HAS BOTH THE ELEGANCE OF THEORY AND THE PRACTICALITY OF EXPERIMENT
THE DIRAC EQUATION

I BAR GAMMA MU PARTIAL MU PSI M C PSI

BAR IS THE REDUCED CONSTANT PSI IS A SPINOR WAVE FUNCTION A COMPONENT FUNCTION OF SPACE AND TIME MU LOOPS OVER SPACE AND TIME COORDINATES USING THE EINSTEIN SUMMATION CONVENTION M IS THE REST MASS AND C IS THE SPEED OF LIGHT GAMMA MU IS A SET OF COMPLEX MATRICES THAT OBEY CERTAIN ALGEBRAIC RELATIONS THEY ANTICOMMUTE THIS EQUATION APPLIES NOT ONLY TO ELECTRONS BUT TO ALL SPIN PARTICLES THE VERSION ABOVE IS FOR A FREE PARTICLE WITHOUT INTERACTIONS

BY COMBINING SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND QUANTUM MECHANICS DIRAC WAS NOT ONLY ABLE TO EXPLAIN THE SPIN OF THE ELECTRON BUT ALSO TO PREDICT HALF OF OUR UNIVERSE ANTIMATTER THOUGH HIS ARGUMENT FOR ANTIMATTER FROM HIS EQUATION IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM THE CURRENT UNDERSTANDING AND HE THOUGHT AT FIRST THAT THE PROTON MIGHT BE THE AS THE POSITRON HAD YET TO BE DISCOVERED

THE SCHRODINGER EQUATION EXPRESSES THE RELATION BETWEEN ENERGY AND MOMENTUM E 2 2 M

DIRAC WANTED TO EXPRESS THE RELATIVISTIC RELATION E 2 P 2 C 2 2 C WHERE E IS ENERGY P IS MOMENTUM REST MASS AND C THE SPEED OF LIGHT

THE EQUATION EXPRESSES THIS FOR A SCALAR PARTICLE

BUT DIRAC WAS LOOKING FOR A LINEAR EQUATION THE SCHRODINGER EQUATION WITH ONE SIDE A 2ND DERIVATIVE AND THE OTHER A 1ST DERIVATIVE DISTINGUISHED BETWEEN SPACE AND TIME DIRAC LOOKED FOR A WAY OF TAKING THE SQUARE ROOT OF THE RELATIVISTIC ENERGY EQUATION TO GIVE A PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION INVOLVING ONLY 1ST DERIVATIVES

ONE DAY WHILE STARING INTO A FIREPLACE THE IDEA HIT HIM THAT THE ONLY ALGEBRAIC WAY OF TAKING THE SQUARE ROOT OF THE RELATIVISTIC ENERGY EQUATION WAS TO MAKE THE WAVE FUNCTION BE A VECTOR WITH PARTS MULTIPLIED BY MATRIX COEFFICIENTS

DEPENDING ON WHAT ONE USES FOR THE MATRICES GAMMA THE PARTS OF THE DIRAC SPINOR WAVE FUNCTION CAN BE SEEN TO REPRESENT AN ELECTRON IN SPIN UP AND SPIN DOWN STATES EACH OF THOSE EITHER WITH LEFT-HANDED OR RIGHT-HANDED HELICITY THIS IS THE WEYL REPRESENTATION OR THE PARTS COULD BE DECOMPOSED TO ELECTRON IN SPIN UP AND SPIN DOWN STATES VERSUS A POSITRON IN SPIN UP AND SPIN DOWN STATES THIS IS THE DIRAC REPRESENTATION

TO TRULY REPRESENT MULTIPLE PARTICLES ONE HAS TO GO THROUGH SECOND QUANTIZATION AND WORK IN A BOCK SPACE WITH CREATION AND ANNIHILATION OPERATORS

THE WEIGHT OF THE WORLD RESTS ON THIS

T I

IN THEORIES THE TENSOR T IS TRACELESS AT THE CLASSICAL LEVEL HOWEVER IN THE QUANTUM THEORY THE SCALE SYMMETRY CAN BE SPOILED BY A SCALE ANOMALY AND THE EXPECTATION VALUE OF THE TRACE OF T CAN BE

CLASSICALLY THEORIES SUCH AS CD OR EM WOULD BE SCALE INVARIANT THIS MEANS NO MASSES CAN BE GENERATED IN CD UPON QUANTIZATION HOWEVER A SCALE ANOMALY IS DEVELOPED AND A PREFERENTIAL ENERGY SCALE IS SELECTED BECAUSE OF QUANTUM EFFECTS

HENCE CD CAN HAVE MASSIVE BOUND STATES SUCH AS PROTONS NEUTRONS AND ALL THE OTHER HADRONS SO LITERALLY OF THE MASS OF THE WORLD IS DUE TO THE FACT ABOVE

OK I STOLE THE PHRASE FROM TONG BUT THE ENTHUSIASM IS ORIGINAL
POSSIBLY

S K LOG I

WHERE S IS THE ENTROPY OMEGA IS THE MULTIPLICITY OF THE SYSTEM THE NUMBER OF ACCESSIBLE MICROSTATES FOR A GIVEN MICROSTATE AND K IS JUST THE BOLTZMANN CONSTANT I THINK ITS COOL BECAUSE IT'S SUCH AN ALL-ENCOMPASSING EQUATION AND STRIKES ME AS THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL BIT OF PHYSICS THAT WE KNOW SO FUNDAMENTAL IT BORDERS ON METAPHYSICS WHETHER YOUR SYSTEM IS RELATIVISTIC QUANTUM MECHANICAL OR CLASSICAL IT WILL STILL OBEY THE ENTROPIC PRINCIPLE
EQUATION NAMELY H I I I TENSE IT'S PROBABLY A GENERIC EQUATION BUT IT'S MY FAVORITE ANYWAY

H IS THE HAMILTONIAN AN OPERATOR WHICH ENCODES THE DYNAMICS OF A PHYSICAL SYSTEM ITS EIGENVALUES ARE POSSIBLE ENERGIES A SYSTEM CAN TAKE AND ITS EIGENSTATE ARE STATIONARY STATES

I IS THE REDUCED PLANCK CONSTANT AND QUANTIFIES HOW MUCH ENERGY A QUANTUM OF RADIATION CARRIES VIDELICET E HF WHERE I H

T IS TIME

I IS A POINT IN HILBERT SPACE WHICH REPRESENTS THE STATE OF A PHYSICAL SYSTEM

EQUATION DESCRIBES HOW A CLOSED SYSTEM'S STATE WILL EVOLVE IN TIME THE HAMILTONIAN WHICH CLASSICALLY CORRESPONDS TO THE ENERGY OF A SYSTEM GENERATES TIME EVOLUTION A STATE WITH A ENERGY WILL NOT EVOLVE EVOLUTION OCCURS DUE TO THE PHASES BETWEEN DIFFERENT ENERGY EIGENSTATE IN A SUPERPOSITION CHANGING AT DIFFERENT RATES

IT'S MY FAVORITE EQUATION BECAUSE IT LIES AT THE FOUNDATION OF QUANTUM MECHANICS AND BECAUSE IT'S SO BEAUTIFULLY SIMPLE AND COMPACT
I'M PARTIAL TO GOLDEN RULE ESPECIALLY IN NOTATION

I F E I 2

WHERE I IS THE INTENSITY OF YOUR SIGNAL E IS THE EXCITATION OPERATOR OF WHATEVER EXCITATION SOURCE YOU'RE USING AND F AND I ARE THE FINAL AND INITIAL STATES OF YOUR SYST RESPECTIVELY

BASICALLY THIS EQUATION ALLOWS YOU TO FIND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE INTENSITY YOU MEASURE I THE EXCITATION PROBE YOU USE E TYPICALLY PHOTONS OR ELECTRONS BUT IT BASICALLY ACCEPTS ANYTHING AND THE QUANTUM-MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF YOUR SYSTEM GIVEN BY I AND F
THEOREM I'M LEGIT READING ABOUT A STOCHASTIC VERSION NOW IT'S A MORE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE WHERE ALL OF THE KNOWN PHYSICAL LAWS CAN BE DERIVED
IT MAY BE SLIGHTLY CHEATING TO SAY EQUATIONS NOT THAT MUCH SINCE YOU CAN EXPRESS THEM AS A SINGLE TENSOR EQUATION BUT I'M NOT MASSIVELY THRILLED BY THAT REPRESENTATION BUT WHEN WRITTEN IN DIFFERENTIAL FORM IN GAUSSIAN UNITS THEY REPRESENT THE SIMPLE WAYS IN WHICH FIELDS AND EM PHENOMENA ARISE AND THEY JUST HAVE SO MUCH MEANINGFUL SYMMETRY AND ANTISYMMETRY THEY'RE ALSO VERY PRETTY TO WRITE OUT AND NOT TOO HARD TO EXPLAIN TO THE LAYMAN

ANOTHER FAVORITE IS GENERALIZED STOKES THM FOR SIMILAR REASONS AND ALSO THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN IT AND EQUATIONS IN PARTICULAR
I LOVE THE EQUATION BUT I'M FAR TOO DISPLACED TO CORRECTLY REMEMBER THE REASON WHY I STARTED TO LOVE IT
C 2

WHERE C IS THE SPEED OF LIGHT IS THE MAGNETIC PERMEABILITY AND IS THE ELECTRIC PERMEABILITY

I REMEMBER WHEN MY TEACHER DERIVED THIS EQUATION OUT OF THE STANDARD WAVE EQUATION IT'S SIMPLE AND BEAUTIFUL IF YOU ASK ME
PV NRA
PRESSURE
V VOLUME
N MOL
R UNIVERSAL GAS CONSTANT
T TEMPERATURE

THE IDEAL GAS EQUATION
SHOWING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE VARIABLES OF AN IDEAL GAS I JUST LOVE EVERYTHING WE CAN DERIVE FROM THIS
E I PI AKA IDENTITY

WHERE

E IS NUMBER THE BASE OF NATURAL LOGARITHMS

I IS THE IMAGINARY UNIT WHICH SATISFIES AND

I IS PI THE RATIO OF THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF A CIRCLE TO ITS DIAMETER
THIS ONE IS THE GENERAL SOLUTION TO ELECTRO STATIC POTENTIALS WICH DIRICHLET BOUNDARY CONDITIONS THIS THE NOT MY FAVORITE EQUATION BECAUSE I LOVE ALL EQUALLY ANYWAYS HERE IT IS

I X I I X G X X DV I G X X BHAT I X DS

I IS THE POTENTIAL
IS THE ELECTRONIC PERCEPTIVITY IN A VACUUM
INTEGRATE OVER SOME BOLME WRT TO X
I X IS THE CHARGE DENSITY AT X
G X X IS THE APPROPRIATE FUNCTION I WILL EXPLAIN THIS LATER
DV IS THE DIFFERENTIAL VOLUME
G X X GRADIENT WRT X OF OUR FUNCTION
DOT PRODUCT
BHAT IS THE SURFACE NORMAL VECTOR OF OUR VOLUME
DS IS THE SURFACE AREA ELEMENT WRT TO X

I LIKE THIS ONE BECAUSE I GREW TO LOVE IT IT IA SO USE TO FIND ANY MOST ELECTRIC POTENTIAL WITH DIRICHLET BOUNDARY CONDITIONS AS LONG AS YOU HAVE AN APPROPRIATE GREENS FUNCTION

WHAT IS THIS FUNCTION IN ELECTROSTATICS WE OFTEN ASK THE QUESTION HOW DOES SOME OBJECT BE IT A CONDUCT INSULATOR OR SOMEWHERE BETWEEN REACT IF WE PLACE A CHARGE AT SOME POINT AROUND IT THE FUNCTION ANSWERS THIS AND WE CAM THEN FIND THE ELECTRIC POTENTIAL AND THUS THE ELECTRIC FIELDS
FIN


I DON'T THINK I HAVE A SINGLE FAVORITE BUT ONE I HAVEN'T SEEN MENTIONED HERE SO FAR IS STOKES THEOREM

INT PARTIAL OMEGA OMEGA INT OMEGA MATHRE D OMEGA

HERE OMEGA IS A DIFFERENTIAL FORM BASICALLY A FUNCTION OF SPACE BUT MORE GENERAL AND OMEGA IS A REGION IN THAT SPACE THE THEOREM RELATES AN INTEGRAL OVER A REGION TO AN INTEGRAL OVER THE BOUNDARY OF THAT REGION I ALWAYS THOUGHT THE FACT THAT SUCH A RELATIONSHIP EXISTS WAS KIND OF WILD EVEN THOUGH IN PRINCIPLE IT'S REALLY EASY TO UNDERSTAND
THE BINDING ENERGY FORMULA

A A FAC 2 FAC Z 2 A FAC FAC A 2 Z 2 A PM DELTA A Z

IT ALWAYS MAKES ME LAUGH WHEN I SEE IT WHICH I PRETTY MUCH NEVER DO
AS THE USUAL CANDIDATE AND WINNER OF THIS KIND OF THREADS IS ALREADY HERE AND WINNING I'LL GO WITH SOMETHING MORE PRACTICABLE AND FUN

THE TSIOLKOVSKY ROCKET EQUATION

THE EQUATION

TV V LN M M

THE PARAMETERS

TV IS THE MAXIMUM CHANGE OF VELOCITY OF THE VEHICLE WITH NO EXTERNAL FORCES ACTING
M IS THE INITIAL TOTAL MASS INCLUDING PROPELLANT
M IS THE FINAL TOTAL MASS WITHOUT PROPELLANT ALSO KNOWN AS DRY MASSACHUSETTS
V IS THE EFFECTIVE EXHAUST VELOCITY

THE MEANING

THE ROCKET EQUATION CAPTURES THE ESSENTIALS OF ROCKET FLIGHT PHYSICS IN A SINGLE SHORT EQUATION
IT ALSO HOLDS TRUE FOR REACTION VEHICLES WHENEVER THE EFFECTIVE EXHAUST VELOCITY IS CONSTANT AND CAN BE SUMMED OR INTEGRATED WHEN THE EFFECTIVE EXHAUST VELOCITY VARIES
IN WHAT HAS BEEN CALLED THE TYRANNY OF THE ROCKET EQUATION THERE IS A LIMIT TO THE AMOUNT OF PAYLOAD THAT THE AIRSHIP CAN CARRY AS HIGHER AMOUNTS OF PROPELLANT INCREMENT THE OVERALL WEIGHT AND THUS ALSO INCREASE THE FUEL CONSUMPTION

THE REASON

ROCKETS HERBAL SPACE PROGRAM HTTPS AWESOME
THERE ARE BILIOUS THE FIRST ONE WICH POPPED INTO MY MIND IS

N A

WHICH IS AN ALGORITHM FOR CALCULATING THE SQUARE ROOT OF A REAL NUMBER A YOU MAKE AN INITIAL GUESS AND THEN PROCEED CALCULATING ITERATIVELY ECC

I LOVE THIS PARTICULAR METHOD FOR 2 REASONS IT CONVERGES LIKE A SLAVIC PROSTITUTE EXTREMELY FAST TRY IT AND IS AN ANCIENT FORMULA I EAST SHOWS ANCIENT PEOPLE WERE NOT AS STUPID AS WE THINK

WIKI


I'M A BIG FAN OF THE GENERALISED GAUSS LAW

INT OMEGA D OMEGA INT DI OMEGA OMEGA

MATHEMATICALLY THIS RELATES THE EXTERIOR DERIVATIVE OF A FORM IN A VOLUME TO THE VALUE ON THE BOUNDARY OF THE VOLUME THE REASON IT'S MY FAVOURITE IS BECAUSE IT RELATES SO MANY BRANCHES OF PHYSICS

IT GIVES HALF OF MAXWELLS EQUATIONS NORTHERS THEOREM AND GENERALISE EQUATIONS WITH A BOUNDARY WHAT IS GREAT ABOUT IT IS HOW ELEGANT AND USEFUL IT IS AT THE SAME TIME IT ALSO WORKS IN ANY NUMBER OF DIMENSIONS

EDIT HERE'S A WIKI LINK TO LEARN MORE I MADE A MISTAKE EARLIER I MEANT GAUSS THEOREM NOT LAW AND EVEN THAT IS WRONG SINCE MATHEMATICIANS CALL THE GENERALISED VERSION STOKES THEOREM

WIKI
THE SCHWARZSCHILD RADIUS EQUATION IS A PERSONAL FAVORITE OF MINE I'M A PHYSICS BOOB SO I'LL LIST THE SIMPLIFIED VERSION
C 2
G AND C ARE THE GRAVITATIONAL CONSTANT AND THE SPEED OF LIGHT RESPECTIVELY
JUST PLUG IN YOUR MASS AND YOU GET THE RADIUS OF THE EVENT HORIZON OF THAT MASS ASSUMING UNIFORM CIRCULAR NON ROTATING ETC
ALSO WIKIPEDIA SAYS THIS IS THE NEWTONIAN VERSION OF THE EQUATION LIKE I SAID I'M A PHYSICS BOOB
Y MX B
EQUATIONS

SUM J FROM TO D DX J F K J K

X T X X X 2 Y X Z EINSTEIN NOTATION

F K IS THE ELECTROMAGNETIC TENSOR WHICH LOOKS LIKE THIS E AND B ARE THE ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC FIELDS

IS THE PERMEABILITY OF FREE SPACE A CONSTANT

J K IS THE CURRENT VECTOR WHERE J IS THE CHARGE AND J J 2 AND J

EQUATIONS ARE VERY USEFUL IN DETERMINING HOW ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS WORK THIS PARTICULAR REPRESENTATION IS IN THE PRESENCE OF ELECTRIC CHARGE AND CURRENT IE NOT AKA INHOMOGENEOUS

I LIKE THIS ONE AS IT'S ACTUALLY VERY SMALL BUT WITH KNOWLEDGE OF EINSTEIN NOTATION AND THE ELECTROMAGNETIC TENSOR IT CONVEYS ALL THE ELECTROMAGNETIC INFORMATION IN THE ABSENCE OF SILLY COMPLICATIONS LIKE PROPAGATION THROUGH MATTER
UH HBO DARE YOU CALL NEWTONS SECOND LAW BORING F MA IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT LAWS OF MOTION AND HELPS US UNDERSTAND RATE OF CHANGE IN MOVING BODIES

THE FACT THAT IT ALL COMES TOGETHER AS NEATLY IT DOES IS ALSO AMAZING TO ME

DON'T UNDERESTIMATE IT'S SIMPLICITY
THE INTEGRAL T SQUARED DT

FROM ONE TO THE CUBE ROOT OF THREE

TIMES THE COSINE

OF THREE PI OVER NINE

IS THE LOG OF THE CUBE ROOT OF E
IT'S A PAIR OF EQUATIONS

DF
F J

IS THE COVARIANT FORM OF EQUATIONS I LOVED WORKING THROUGH SO MUCH MATH TO GET SUCH SIMPLE EQUATIONS WHICH EXPLAIN SO MUCH ALMOST EVERYTHING YOU SEE IN YOUR DAY TO DAY LIFE IS EXPLAINED ENTIRELY OR IN PART BY THESE SIMPLE EQUATIONS

F IS THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD STRENGTH TENSOR A 2 FORM AND J IS THE DIMENSIONAL CHARGE CURRENT
EVERYONE KNOW THIS ELUTION BUT LET'S FOLLOW THE RULES

CONTINUITY EQUATION

WHERE RHO IS A NUMBER DENSITY OF SOME QUANTITY J IS A FLUX SIGMA IS A SOURCE TERM AND T IS TIME

THE EQUATION DESCRIBES THE TRANSPORT OF SOME QUANTITY MASS ENERGY CHARGE NUMBER DENSITY ETC AND CAN BE FOUND IN ALMOST EVERY AREA OF PHYSICS FROM CLASSICAL MECHANICS TO RELATIVITY IT IS QUITE IMPORTANT FOR ME SINCE I OFTEN USE IT IN GLOW DISCHARGE MODELING

HOWEVER IT IS NOT UNUSUAL SO NO BONUS POINTS
THIS IS CHEATING BECAUSE IT'S A DEFINITION NOT AN EQUATION YOU'LL HAVE TO FORGIVE ME BECAUSE MY MASTERS IS IN INFORMATICS RATHER THAN A REAL SCIENCE

ANYWAY THE DEFINITION OF INFORMATION IS A DIFFERENCE THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE

IT'S A POWERFUL DEFINITION BECAUSE IT COVERS AN EXTREMELY COMPLEX CONCEPT WHIST BEING INCREDIBLY CONCISE AT THE SAME TIME
RIEMANN INTEGRAL OR THE SUM OF AN INFINITE NUMBER OF RECTANGLES UNDERNEATH A CURVE

B F X DX LIM N RIGHTARROW NIFTY SUM N I F I DELTA X

IT WAS THE FIRST PIECE OF CALCULUS THAT REALLY MADE ME STOP AND REALIZE THAT I WAS IN MATH NOW
MY FAVORITE EQUATION HAS TO BE OHMS LAW WHERE I V ROYAL I FIND THIS EQUATION TO BE SO SIMPLE YET AN IMPORTANT ONE FOR ANYONE WHO STUDIES ELECTRICITY

FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW I IS THE CURRENT AMPS V IS THE VOLTAGE AND R IS THE RESISTANCE

F R 2

BEAUTIFUL SIMPLE REVOLUTIONARY
EMF NAB T

THIS IS KNOWN AS FARADAY S LAW OF INDUCTION HERE EMF IS THE ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE N IS THE NUMBER OF LOOPS IN A COIL B IS THE MAGNETIC FLUX AND DELTA T IS THE CHANGE IN TIME THE UNITS OF EMF IS VOLTS

IT PREDICTS HOW A MAGNETIC FIELD INTERACTS WITH AN ELECTRIC CIRCUIT

I LOVE IT BECAUSE I'M LEARNING IT RIGHT NOW AND IT MAKES SENSE TO ME FIRST TIME ANYTHING WITH A WIERD SYMBOL MADE SENSE TO ME AND RESTARTED MY INTEREST IN PHYSICS
LIM N SHORTRIGHTARROW NIFTY SUM N N ALPHA N FAC ALPHA ALPHA

IT ISN'T PHYSICS SO MUCH AS MATH BUT IT CAN BE USED TO SHOW THAT

ALSO SORRY IF IT DOESN'T FORMAT RIGHT I'M ON MOBILE
ONE OF MY PERSONAL FAVORITES IS

F C 2 P

WHERE F IS THE FREQUENCY OF A SOUND AND P IS ITS PITCH DIMENSIONLESS IN OCTAVES C IS A TUNING CONSTANT MORE ON THAT BELOW

IT'S INTERESTING AS IT DEFINES PITCH AS THE BINARY LOGARITHM OF FREQUENCY RELATIVE TO A CONSTANT SPECIFICALLY IT DESCRIBES EQUAL TEMPERAMENT PITCH THERE IS MUCH DEBATE IN MUSIC ABOUT TUNING SYSTEMS AND I LOVE THIS EQUATION FOR ITS ELEGANCE AND ABILITY TO DESCRIBE PITCH PURELY LOGARITHMICALLY AND WITHOUT REQUIRING TRADITIONAL MUSICAL NOTATION

TRADITIONALLY WESTERN TUNING HAS DEFINED C HERE REPRESENTING THE NOTE C TO BE EXACTLY EQUAL TO 2 HOWEVER IT CAN BE ANY POSITIVE FREQUENCY PHILOSOPHICAL PITCH IS WHEN C IS EQUAL SUCH THAT EVERY C NOTE IS A POWER OF 2 ONE COULD ALSO SET C TO LEADING TO THE EXTREMELY ELEGANT F 2 P THIS ONLY DIFFERS FROM PHILOSOPHICAL PITCH IN THAT THE OCTAVE NUMBERING WOULD BE DIFFERENT ONE COULD ALSO SET C TO EXACTLY AND INCREMENT THE OCTAVE NUMBERING AT A AS OPPOSED TO COUNTY
I D SAY THE ACTION S R DEVOL EVEN THOUGH THE
CORRESPONDING EQUATIONS ARE SOME HELL THE

IDENTITY WHILE I STILL DON'T QUITE GRASP THE IMPLICATIONS I THINK IT'S AWESOME THAT TWO SEEMINGLY INDEPENDENT NUMBERS ARE SOME HOW CONNECTED
F R MA

APPARENTLY THIS NEEDS EXPLAINING I IS THE MEMBER SUCH THAT IF YOU SQUARE IT YOU GET R IS THE SET OF ALL REAL NUMBERS ELEM MEANS IS AN ELEMENT OF IT'S COOL BECAUSE IT'S NOT INTUITIVE BUT IT'S SIMPLE TO PROVE COOL HUH DID I SATE THE DOWN VOTERS OF THE SUB
THE HEAT OF THE MEAT IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE CROSS PRODUCTS OF THE TORQUE OF THE PORK AND THE SPEED OF THE DEED BY THE ANGLE OF THE DANGLE
THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE IT PROVES THAT OUR LIVES ARE NOT DETERMINISTIC WHICH IS BOTH LIBERATING AND TERRIFYING
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE INTERESTED IN QUITE A BROAD AREA OF PHYSICS RESEARCH AS LONG AS YOU KNOW YOU WOULD BE HAPPY DOING ANYTHING WITHIN THAT AREA THEN I WOULD FOCUS ON THE SUPERVISOR GROUP THAT YOU WILL APPLY TO THE FIT BETWEEN YOURSELF AND A GROUP IS MASSIVELY IMPORTANT AS IS THE FIT FOR YOU IN A CITY OR INSTITUTION START LOOKING INTO WHAT GROUPS ARE OUT THERE AND SEEING IF YOU CAN SET UP SOME INTERVIEWS OR PHONE CALLS THESE WILL GIVE YOU A GOOD FEEL FOR HOW CERTAIN GROUPS WORK SOME IMPORTANT THINGS TO LOOK AT ARE PUBLICATIONS AND TRAVEL IT LOOKS GOOD WHEN A PROFESSOR IS CONSTANTLY DOING TALKS EXTERNAL TO THEIR INSTITUTION HOWEVER THIS IS MOSTLY BAD FOR YOU AS THEIR STUDENT BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT TO REACH THEM IN TERMS OF PUBLICATIONS MAKE SURE THE PROFESSOR DOESN'T JUST PIGGY BACK ONTO THE PAPERS OF THEIR STUDENTS IT'S IMPORTANT FOR FUNDING AND THE FUTURE PRESTIGE OF THE GROUP THAT THEY'RE DRIVING THEIR OWN RESEARCH TOO LOOK FOR STUDENTS BEING INDEPENDENT WITHIN A GROUP AND PUBLISHING PAPERS WITH FEW AUTHORS
ONE THING THAT YOU'LL PROBABLY LEARN IS THAT FIELDS OF STUDY THEMSELVES ARE VERY VERY BROAD AND WITHIN EACH YOU CAN FIND SOME TOPIC THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN DON'T LOOK TOO HARD AT WHAT LOOKS COOL RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THE DEEPER YOU GO THEY MIGHT NOT STAY THAT COOL

I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO FIND A GOOD SUPERVISOR DOING THE MOST INTERESTING WORK CAN BE MISERABLE IF YOU HATE THE PEOPLE YOU'RE WORKING WITH
STATISTICS IS SO IMPORTANT IN GRAD SCHOOL AND REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU CHOOSE TO STUDY YOU'LL BE PUBLISHING ON THE BACK OF A STATISTICIAN IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT STUFF BY YOURSELF
SKIP GRAD SCHOOL FOR NOW IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT A FUTURE IF YOU AREN'T BALLS TO THE WALLS ABOUT ACADEMIA IT'S A SHIT SHOW WITH VERY LITTLE FUNDING VERY LITTLE OPPORTUNITY FOR ADVANCEMENT AND PRACTICALLY ZERO INCENTIVE I THINK WORK THAT IS DONE IN ACADEMIA IS GREAT BUT YOU LITERALLY HAVE TO KILL YOURSELF FOR DECADES TO GET TO THAT POINT IF YOU WERE SUPER PASSIONATE ABOUT SOMETHING THEN THIS WOULD BE A DIFFERENT STORY BUT IF YOU'RE WAFFLING GO SEE IF YOU LIKE INDUSTRY BECAUSE IN THE WORST CASE YOU MAKE MORE MONEY NOW THAN YOU WOULD AFTER YEARS OF GRAD SCHOOL AND YOU STILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO BACK
FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE AND FROM THAT OF MY COLLEAGUES IS THAT A LOT OF IT DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU FALL INTO THINGS WHAT YOUR ADVISOR DOES AND SO ON

I THINK THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WHEN CHOOSING AN ADVISOR AND DECIDING WHAT TO WORK ON IS TO REMEMBER THAT YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR MIND OF COURSE YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS ALL THE TIME BUT IT IS MUCH BETTER TO CHANGE NOW RATHER THAN WAIT A FEW YEARS AND SEE IF IT DOES BETTER LOOK AT WHAT THE POSTDOCS AND FACULTY ARE WORKING ON AND DECIDE IF THAT IS A PATH THAT YOU ARE INTERESTED IN FOLLOWING
THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU FOR TAKING TIME OUT OF YOUR DAY TO RESPOND I FEEL MOST INCLINED AT THE MOMENT TO WORK IN THE GRAVITATIONAL PHYSICS FIELD AND I AM CONSIDERING MY OPTIONS FOR POTENTIAL PHD GROUPS I THINK THIS MIGHT BE RIGHT FOR ME

I HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION FOR R PHYSICS SHOULD I CONSIDER PERHAPS STARTING A MASTERS PROGRAM SUCH THAT I FAMILIARIZE MYSELF WITH SOME OF THE MORE RIGOROUS TOPICS BEFORE BEGINNING A PHD I MAY BE ABLE TO DECIDE WITH MORE CONFIDENCE WHERE MY INTERESTS REALLY LIE IF I'M FACED WITH SOME OF THESE FIELDS WERE THERE ANY RESOURCES BOOKS ETC THAT HELPED YOU TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT PHD PROGRAM FOR YOU
THAT'S OK I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD FOCUS ON SPECIALIZING JUST YET YOU'RE STILL AN UNDERGRAD AND I DON'T AGREE WITH CURRENT NORMS THAT YOU SHOULD DECIDE YOUR FIELD AT THE AGE OF GO OUT AND EXPLORE A BIT BEFORE YOU MAKE A DECISION ABOUT STUDY AREAS
LEARN AS MUCH AS YOU CAN ABOUT EVERYTHING NOW WHEN YOU GO TO GRAD SCHOOL INTERVIEW WITH A TON OF GROUPS IN A WIDE DISTRIBUTION OF SUB FIELDS PICK THE ONE WITH WHICH YOU FEEL THE MOST CAMARADERIE THERE ARE TONS OF INTERESTING PROBLEMS BUT GOOD RESEARCH COMMUNITIES ARE HARDER TO COME BY HAVING A VERY BROAD BACKGROUND WILL HELP YOU IN ANY SPECIALTY
NOT A PHYSICIST BUT SOMEONE WITH A WIDE RANGE OF INTERESTS AND MULTIPLE GRADUATE DEGREES YOU MAY NEVER FIND ONE AREA IF YOU JUST LOVE TO LEARN THAT SAID FOR ME ONE OF THE EASIEST WAYS TO KNOW IF YOU ARE FOLLOWING THE RIGHT PATH IS HOW HAPPY YOU ARE DISCUSSING IT IF YOU JUST BURST WITH EXCITEMENT AT THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE RESEARCH AND FEEL THE NEED TO TELL EVERYONE ABOUT EVERY DETAIL THAT YOU LEARNED OR ARE DISCOVERING THEN THAT'S A GREAT AREA FOR YOU

SEPARATE WOW THIS IS INTERESTING FROM THIS IS FREAKING AMAZING STUFF HOW AM I EVER GOING TO NOT THINK ABOUT THIS
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY SUCH THING AS A PAPER PHYSICIST SHOULD READ CERTAINLY THERE ARE CONCEPTS EVERY PHYSICIST SHOULD BE FAMILIAR WITH BUT THAT'S WHAT CLASSES ARE FOR THE RESEARCH PAPERS ARE OFTEN NOT THE BEST WAY TO LEARN THESE THINGS
WITHOUT A DOUBT WHAT IS LIFE BY ERWIN SCHRODINGER

DEFINITELY A MUST READ FOR EVERY PHYSICIST ESPECIALLY ONE IN TRAINING

I'LL HAVE SEVERAL MORE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT DON'T HAVE THE TIME RIGHT THIS MINUTE TO FIND THE REFERENCES AND POST THEM I'LL POST THEM IN THE NEXT DAY OR SO
I'M A HUGE FAN OF THERE ARE NO PARTICLES THERE ARE ONLY FIELDS MIGHT NOT REALLY APPLY TO COSMOLOGY MUCH BUT IF YOU EVER END UP RUNNING INTO ANY PARTICLE PHYSICS IT CERTAINLY HELPS DOESN'T REQUIRE A HUGE AMOUNT OF MATH OR THEORETICAL PHYSICS KNOWLEDGE EITHER

THERE ARE A LOT OF ARTICLES IN THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS WHICH IS A JOURNAL DEDICATED TO EDUCATIONAL ASPECTS OF PHYSICS I REMEMBER READING ONE SHOWING HOW RAPIDITY NATURALLY ARISES IN SPECIAL RELATIVITY STARTING WITH THE LORENTZ GROUP
SUGGESTIONS ON GIVING TALKS LIKE IT OR NOT WE HAVE TO PRESENT OUR WORK FORTUNATELY GIVING A GOOD TECHNICAL TALK IS A SKILL YOU CAN LEARN

2 IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN LEARNING SOME GRAVITY GENERAL RELATIVITY I RECOMMEND ALL THE PAPERS IN THE GR MILESTONES ISSUE OF CAG SOME GREAT READABLE SUMMARIES OF IMPORTANT RESEARCH IN THE FIELD

LIVING REVIEWS IS AN EXCELLENT PLACE TO LEARN A TON FROM THE GROUND UP THESE PAPERS ARE BIG COMPREHENSIVE FREE AND ACCESSIBLE

I'M BIASED SINCE THIS IS MY FIELD BUT I RECOMMEND THE FIRST FIGO DETECTION PAPER MAKE NO MISTAKE THIS IS A HUGE MILESTONE AND THE NRL PAPER IS PRETTY READABLE

SINCE YOU'RE INTO COSMOLOGY THE UNIVERSE IS AN INSIDE OUT STAR YES IT'S AN APRIL JOKE BUT IT'S ACTUALLY AN EXCELLENT EDUCATIONAL PIECE DESCRIBES THE BASIC IDEA OF MEASUREMENTS OF THE COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND

EDIT ADDED NUMBER MIGHT ADD MORE IF I THINK OF SOME
PAPER ON THE EXISTENCE OF THE NEUTRON
FIRST CHOICE J SOUTH BELL'S SOCKS AND THE NATURE OF REALITY

SECOND CHOICE FORMS OF RELATIVISTIC DYNAMICS
NOT A PHYSICS PAPER PER SE BUT I STRONGLY FEEL THAT EVERY EDUCATED PERSON NEEDS TO READ THE RESPONSIBILITY OF INTELLECTUALS BY NOAM CHOMSKY
MORE IS DIFFERENT
A VERY SOLIDLY WRITTEN AND IMPORTANT PAPER IS ALAN ORIGINAL PAPER ON INFLATION YOU CAN FIND IT BEHIND A GRAYWALL EASILY WITH BETTER FORMATTING BUT THERE'S A FREE VERSION HERE I WOULD SAY THERE ARE SOME OTHER PAPERS WORTH READING IN ORIGINAL FORM LIKE MONOPOLE STRING PAPER BUT THIS IS THE ONE THAT COMES TO MIND FOR ME IN COSMOLOGY
PAPERS PAPER ON THE MAGNETIC MONOPOLE HE GIVES AN INTRODUCTION ABOUT HIS THOUGHTS ON CREATING NEW PHYSICS AND THIS PAPER IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF FLESHING OUT A WHAT IF FREEMAN PAPER THAT GOES OVER PROOF OF EQUATION ALSO A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A PHYSICIST EMPLOYING TECHNIQUES LOOKING FOR NEW PHYSICS
ANYONE WHO STUDIES MATH OR PHYSICS SHOULD KNOW ABOUT CHAOS AND SHOULD READ DETERMINISTIC NONPERIODIC FLOW BY LORENZ

RESEARCH LORENZ DETERMINISTIC
TEXTS EINSTEIN SPECTRAL IWW
QUANTUM MECHANICS BY DIRAC
I'M ON MOBILE RN SO CAN'T GIVE A LINK BUT YOU SHOULD CHECK OUT THE LIST OF IMPORTANT PAPERS IN PHYSICS ON WIKIPEDIA I'M AN ENGINEER SO I DUNNO HOW RELEVANT THEY ARE BUT IT SHOULD MAKE FOR A GOOD HISTORICAL OVERVIEW
EINSTEIN RELATIVITY PAPERS

SPECIAL RELATIVITY


GENERAL RELATIVITY

FOR COSMOLOGY
THE COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND THE HISTORY OF ITS EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE FOR COSMOLOGY

HOW EINSTEIN FOUND HIS FIELD EQUATIONS

WITH YOUR INTEREST IN COSMOLOGY HERE IS SOME BACKGROUND INFO YOU MAY FIND OF INTEREST ON DARK ENERGY THEORETICAL PHYSICIST SEAN CARROLL WAS ONE OF THE EARLY THEORISTS WORKING ON THIS SEE WHY IS THE UNIVERSE ACCELERATING WHICH HAS MORE DETAILS THAN HIS LATER PAPER ALSO A PAPER BY FOLIO MELIA ON THE COSMIC EQUATION OF STATE ALSO THEORETICAL PHYSICIST SABINE HOSSENFELDER JUST PUBLISHED AN INFORMATIVE ARTICLE ON HER BLOG WHERE DOES DARK ENERGY COME FROM AND WHAT S IT MADE OF I ALSO RECOMMEND THIS ARTICLE PARTICULARLY FOR ITS EXPLANATION OF THE EQUATION OF STATE

THANKS FOR ASKING THIS QUESTION AND THANKS TO THE MANY WHO ARE PROVIDING SUCH EXCELLENT REFERENCES I THINK I'VE LEARNED MORE FROM THE ANSWERS HERE THAN FROM JUST ABOUT ANY OTHER PHYSICS SUBREDDIT THREAD I'VE READ
THIS IS VERY EXOTIC BUT THE MOST INTERESTING PAPER I EVER READ WAS LIFE AT LOW REYNOLDS NUMBERS BY PURCELL KNOWN FROM THE PURCELL EFFECT IT'S A BIRTHDAY TALK THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY TRANSCRIBED AND PUBLISHED SO IT HAS A VERY DIFFERENT TONE TO IT

IT'S ABOUT THE MOVEMENT OF SMALL THINGS IN FLUIDS AT SMALL SCALES WATER FEELS LICK THICK HONEY SO THE USUAL MACROSCOPIC SWIMMING MOTIONS ARE USELESS BECAUSE YOU MOVE AS IF YOU HAVE NO INERTIA FROM THIS HE GOES ON ABOUT THE SWIMMING TECHNIQUES OF BACTERIA AND HOW IT HELPS THEM GET NUTRIENTS
THE ONE'S CONTAINED IN ON THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS THE DREAMS THAT STUFF IS MADE OF AND GOD CREATED THE INTEGERS ALL OF THE ESSAYS ARE COMPILED BY STEPHEN HAWKING


ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING RARELY INVOLVES UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE ELECTRONS ARE ACTUALLY DOING AND IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF TOUGH TO MAKE THE CONCEPTUAL JUMP BETWEEN THE FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS AND THE COMMON ABSTRACTIONS RESISTORS TRANSISTORS VOLTAGE SOURCES ETC THAT ARE ACTUALLY USED IN ENGINEERING

I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK IT'S USEFUL TO MAKE THAT CONNECTION IT MAY BE SATISFYING INTELLECTUALLY BUT IT WON'T HELP YOU SOLVE ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING PROBLEMS MORE EASILY
ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO UNDERSTAND CIRCUITRY IS THE WATER ANALOGY IMAGINE THE CONDUCTOR IS A PIPE WITH WATER ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH IT

AMPERAGE FLOW RATE

VOLTAGE PRESSURE

RESISTANCE DIAMETER OF PIPE

NOW THIS ANALOGY DOESN'T EXPLAIN EVERYTHING BUT IT HELPS GET A GRASP OF THE CONCEPT OF HOW ELECTRICITY FLOWS
SORRY I DON'T REALLY KNOW OF ANY GOOD CIRCUITS BOOKS BUT ELECTRICAL POTENTIAL AND VOLTAGE ARE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME THING VOLTAGE DROP IS JUST THE DIFFERENCE IN ELECTRICAL POTENTIAL BETWEEN TWO POINTS EAST G BETWEEN THE TERMINALS OF A CIRCUIT ELEMENT
MAN I AM IN THE SAME BOAT AS YOU I TOO AM FUCKED BECAUSE I TRY TO STUDY BUT I AM NOT GETTING ANYWHERE AT ALL
YEAH BUT HOW DID HE USE A SHIFT IN THE DRIFTING OF PAPER TO ESTIMATE THAT
FERMI PROBLEMS ARE THE BEST
WELL HIS ESTIMATE WAS LOW TRINITY S YIELD WAS CLOSER TO KT
I JUST HAD TO SOLVE THIS EARLIER TODAY IN MY PHYSICS SEMINAR TOOK ME ABOUT HALF AN HOUR TO FIGURE IT OUT ODD COINCIDENCE THAT I'D SEE THIS ON HERE THE SAME DAY I HAD TO SOLVE IT IN CLASS
HMM I DID AN EXERCISE LIKE THIS MY FRESHMAN YEAR
I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT A TYPICAL BIOMECHANICS COURSE COVERS GOOGLE SEEMS TO SHOW A FAIR AMOUNT OF VARIETY WITH SOME COURSES SEEMING FAIRLY CLOSE TO A PHYSICS COURSE AND OTHERS A BIT FARTHER OFFICIAL OF COURSE EVEN THE BAREST INTRODUCTION TO THE SUBJECT IS MORE OF A FOUNDATION THAN MANY PHYSICS STUDENTS HAVE DO YOU HAVE A COURSE SYLLABUS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

THE PHYSICS HORROR STORIES SEEM OVERBLOWN TO ME BUT THEN I WOULD SAY THAT WOULDN'T I
JUST GRAB THEM BY THE GAUGES
AND MAKE NEUTRINOS PAY FOR IT
HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS

LISTEN FOLKS SOMETHING IS GOING ON OKAY THE CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT BUT SOMETHING IS GOING ON WITH THE ROTATION OF GALAXIES SO THEY'RE SAYING MAYBE LIKE OF MATTER IS DARK BUT ACTUALLY IF YOU LISTEN TO THE REALLY SMART PEOPLE THE REAL NUMBER IS MORE LIKE DARK OKAY MY UNCLE WAS A PROFESSOR AT MIT AND AND I WENT TO WHARTON SO LIKE GOOD SMART GENES RIGHT YOU DON'T BUILD LIKE REALLY BEAUTIFUL TREMENDOUS BUILDINGS WITHOUT GOOD GENES RIGHT BUT MY UNCLE WOULD SAY NUCLEAR IS THE BIG ONE AFTER NUCLEAR IT'S ALL OVER FOLKS AND YOU'VE GOT THIS WEAK BARACK OBAMA PRESIDENCY THAT JUST LET'S THAT MANIAC IN NORTH KOREA HAVE ALL THE NUKES HE WANTS A SHAME SUCH A SHAME SUCH AN UNBELIEVABLE SHAME BUT ALSO YOU KIND OF HAVE TO RESPECT HIM IN NORTH KOREA BECAUSE HE TOOK OUT ALL THE GENERALS WHO WEREN'T FOR HIM AND STAYED WITH THE POWER THIS WHOLE TIME YOU GOTTA KIND OF RESPECT THAT IN A WAY BECAUSE THAT'S THE SORT OF THING NOT EVERYBODY CAN LIKE DO BUT MY UNCLE WOULD SAY NUCLEAR IS THE WHOLE GAME BUT NOW YOU'VE GOT ALL THIS DARK MATTER AND IT'S OF MATTER THAT ISN'T EVEN WITH THE NUCLEAR AND OUR COUNTRY'S VERY STUPID REPRESENTATIVES DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT IS WE LET OF MATTER INTO THIS COUNTRY AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT IS OR WHERE IT COMES FROM PEOPLE SAY ANIONS AND THEY SAY LIKE WIMPS BUT THE ONLY WIMPS ARE THE WIMPS IN THE TOTALLY RIGGED AND BIASED MEDIA WHO NEVER REPORT ON CROOKED HILLARY DELETED EMAILS
BUILD THE DOMAIN WALL
IF THE LOC DOESN'T FIND SUPERSYMMETRY IT'S CAUSE THE LAWS OF NATURE ARE RIGGED
LOL I LOVE THE ARXIV
GONNA LEAVE FEYNMAN TO EVERYONE ELSE AS YOU COULD BASICALLY LINK ANYTHING BY HIM AND IT WOULD FIT THE CATEGORY THIS IS A REALLY GREAT INTERVIEW WITH OPPENHEIMER SEEMED LIKE A VERY LIKEABLE AND INTERESTING GUY

EDIT FUCK IT GOTTA ADD SOME FEYNMAN LOS ALAMOS FROM BELOW IS ONE OF THE MOST ENTERTAINING HOURS OF AUDIO YOU'LL LISTEN TO
I ENJOYED THE WIT AND HISTORICAL BACKGROUND FROM THIS INTERVIEW OF EARLY COSMOLOGIST DENNIS SCIARA WHO SUPERVISED THE PHD WORK OF STEPHEN HAWKING MARTIN REES GEORGE ELLIS AND OTHERS THAT I BRIEFLY REVIEWED IN THIS COSMOLOGY SUBREDDIT POST

ESPECIALLY NOTE POINT 2 ABOUT HIS MEETING WITH EINSTEIN AND HOW AS A NERVOUS YOUNG PROFESSOR FEELING INTIMIDATED BEFORE THE GREAT SCIENTIST SCIARA USED SOME VERY CLEVER HUMOR TO BREAK THE ICE
FEYNMAN FOR THE WIN

MORE FEYNMAN
MY BRO WORKS IN A PRISON AS A CORRECTIONAL OFFICER AND RECENTLY THEY INSTALLED A MACHINE THAT USES TO SEE IF THE PRISONERS HAVE ANYTHING THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE INSTEAD OF MAKING THEM STRIP AND HE WANTS TO KNOW IF HE SHOULD BE WORRIED IF HE'S GOING TO BE THE GUY WHO SITS NEXT TO IT FOR HOURS
WOULD LOVE TO GET A REALITY CHECK ON THIS NEW PROCESS FOR CONVERTING TO ETHANOL
WHEN I STICK A POLE INTO PUTTY THE PUTTY SWIRLS UP THE POLE INSTEAD OF JUST AROUND IT WHAT CAUSES IT TO DO THIS THE BEST I CAN GUESS IS THAT YOUR BASICALLY BECAUSE THE TOP OF THE PUTTY IS AFFECTED BY THE ROTATION MORE THAN THE BOTTOM THE TOP IS PULLED OVER THE BOTTOM STACKING IT AND THEN THE NEXT LAYER IS STACKED AND SO ON THIS WOULD ALSO ACCOUNT FOR WHY THE LAYERS GET THINNER TOWARDS THE TOP AM I IN THE BALLPARK HERE PLEASE EXPLAIN
SEVERAL SCIENCE EDUCATORS USE PRESSURE AND VALVING TO EXPLAIN WHY BLOWING ON YOUR HAND WITH PURSED LIPS IS COOLER THAN THE HOT BREATH OF YOUR OPEN MOUTH

HERE'S ONE EXAMPLE AND ANOTHER

WHILE THERE MIGHT BE SOME PRESSURE AND EXPANSION ISN'T IT RELATIVELY NOMINAL JUST A FEW PSI DIFFERENCE FROM THE HOT BREATH IS ANY SERIOUS COMPRESSION OCCURRING IN THE MOUTH TO DRIVE ANY SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION

ISN'T THE EFFECT TYPICALLY NOMINAL MAYBE IMPERCEPTIBLE UNTIL TRULY HIGH PRESSURE OR MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF GAS AS IN WEATHER PATTERNS WHERE SMALL DIFFERENCES ADD UP

ISN'T THE COOLING FELT ON THE HAND MORE ATTRIBUTABLE TO OTHER MECHANISMS IF SO WHICH ONES EXPLAIN THE DEMO BETTER THAN IF NOT HOW IS THE EFFECT MORE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE THAN ENTRAINED AMBIENT AIR EVAPORATIVE COOLING AND FORCED CONVECTIVE COOLING WHAT IS THE PERCENT IMPACT OF JT OVER THOSE OTHER EFFECTS

THIS EXPLANATION ENTRAINED AMBIENT AIR SEEMS CLOSER TO THE TRUTH BUT DOESN'T EXACTLY NAIL THE BERNOULLI RELEVANCE WHICH IS ANOTHER SERIES OF MISLEAD CLASSROOM DEMOS
IS THERE A NUMERICAL ESTIMATE FOR THE TOTAL ENTROPY OF THE UNIVERSE
LETS SAY I HAVE A LONG POLE WITH ROUNDED ENDS AND I BALANCE IT PERFECTLY ON ITS END IF I PUSH IT IT WILL FALL OVER IF I TRY STAND IT UP BUT PUT IT AT A SLIGHT ANGLE IT WILL FALL OVER THE SMALLER THE ANGLE IS THE LONGER IT WILL TAKE TO FALL OVER IT WILL ACCELERATE SLOWER IN THEORY I COULD BALANCE IT SO THAT THE ACCELERATION IS REALLY REALLY SLOW SO IT WOULD LOOK AS IF IT WAS STANDING STILL FOR A LONG TIME BEFORE FALLING OVER WITH SEEMINGLY NO OUTSIDE INPUT

THEORETICALLY I COULD HAVE THE POLE STANDING UP FOR YEARS BEFORE FALLING OVER WITH NO EXTERNAL ACTION HOWEVER THIS SEEMS TO REALLY GO AGAINST MY INBUILT SENSE OF PHYSICS IT JUST DOESNT SEEM RIGHT IS THIS POSSIBLE COULD I BALANCE A POLE THAT WILL FALL OVER IN YEARS
HAH WE PLAYED THIS IN MY INTRO PHYSICS LABS IF WE FINISHED BEFORE TIME WAS UP
INTERESTING HOW MUCH IT LOOKS LIKE THE 2D SPACE PLANE IS SIMPLY TILTING IN 3D AS IF LINEAR ACCELERATION IN 3D IS JUST ROTATION IN
RELATIVELY EASY
SOME OF THOSE LEVELS WERE TRICKY VERY FUN
DELETED
I ALWAYS THOUGHT SPECIAL RELATIVITY WAS EASY TO UNDERSTAND ANYWAY I WOULDN'T THINK OF SAYING THE SAME OF GENERAL BUT THIS IS A REALLY FUN GAME
SO IF I UNDERSTAND THIS CORRECTLY AS I'M GETTING CLOSER TO THE SPEED OF LIGHT THE WORLD IN DIRECTION OF MY MOVEMENT SHRINKS MORE AND MORE AND AT C IT WOULD BECOME PLINTHLIKE WHICH IS NOT PHYSICALLY MEANINGFUL THEREFORE IMPOSSIBLE
AND YOU CAN'T SHRINK BEYOND ZERO SO GETTING FASTER THAN C IS THEREFORE IMPOSSIBLE
I SPENT THE PAST TWO HOURS IN THIS GAME

AWESOME STUFF
GOTTA LOVE THE HERBAL SPACE PROGRAM MUSIC
REQUIRING FLASH ARE YOU KIDDING ME PASS
BULLETS START MOVING BACKWARDS AT SOME POINT WTF THAT'S NOT QUITE CORRECT AND GAME JUST SUCKS
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT YEAR OLDS WERE TRYING TO LEARN RELATIVITY

IF THIS IS MEANT FOR ADULTS GOOD GOD WHAT IS THAT SAYING ABOUT PEOPLE TODAY
ARE YOU A TEACHER OR A STUDENT

IF THE STUDENT IS AS BRIGHT AS YOU MAKE HIM SOUND THEN MY GUESS IS THAT HE FAILED SIMPLY BECAUSE HE DID NOT DO THE HOMEWORK SADLY I'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF BRIGHT STUDENTS FAIL FOR THIS REASON YOU SEE THIS A LOT IN LOWER LEVEL CLASSES I'M GUESSING THAT PHYSICS IS A FRESHMAN OR SOPHOMORE LEVEL COURSE
WHY THE ACTUAL FUCK DO YOU THINK THAT PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET WITH NO CONTEXT OR DATA COULD ANSWER THIS
ASKING QUESTIONS IN CLASS IS ONE THING BUT GOING HOME AND GRINDING OUT SOLUTIONS TO ALL THE HARD PROBLEMS IS ANOTHER
THIS HAS BECOME A PATTERN RECENTLY NO ONE HERE KNOWS WHAT PHYSICS IS

IF THIS IS A STUDENT IN YOUR CLASS THEN SURELY YOU CAN SEE WHERE HE LOST HIS MARKS BY SIMPLY LOOKING AT HIS RECORD
DEPENDS WHAT YOU MEAN BY AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE

IT USED TO BE THE CASE THAT PEOPLE WITH AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE WOULD SERIOUSLY STRUGGLE TO MAKE IT THROUGH UNDERGRAD WITH OF THE POPULATION GOING THROUGH UNI AT ALL IN THE UK AT LEAST NOW IT SEEMS THAT A MUCH LARGER PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION CAN ACHIEVE A UNIVERSITY DEGREE BUT THEN AGAIN SOME OF THOSE DEGREES ARE IN THINGS LIKE BA HONS ADVENTURE AND OUTDOOR MANAGEMENT WHICH REALLY ARE A LOT EASIER THAN A DEGREE IN PHYSICS

COURSES UNDERGRADUATE

I WOULD SAY IF SOMEONE MAKES IT THROUGH UNDERGRAD PHYSICS WITH REASONABLY GOOD GRADES THEY COULD PROBABLY PUT OUT A PASSABLE THESIS BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT IF THEY CAN DO THAT THEY ARE PROBABLY ABOVE AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE

ALSO TIME IS A FACTOR I KNOW SMART I WOULD CONSIDER ABOVE AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LEFT WITHOUT A PHD BECAUSE THEY RAN OUT OF TIME THEIR SCHOLARSHIPS EXPIRED AND HAD TO WITHDRAW OR PAY HUGE FEES

IT ALSO DEPENDS A LITTLE ON WHETHER YOU MEAN AN EXPERIMENTAL OR THEORETICAL PHD I MAY GET SHOUTED DOWN FOR THIS BUT I CAN IMAGINE A WEAK EXPERIMENTAL STUDENT SCRAPING THROUGH BY SPENDING LOADS OF TIME IN THE LAB I CAN'T SEE HOW MORE TIME HELPS YOU AS A THEORIST IF YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND THE RELEVANT CONCEPTS OBVIOUS BIAS I AM A THEORIST
NATURE STUDY ON SMART CHILDREN

RESULTS CONTRADICT LONG-ESTABLISHED IDEAS THAT EXPERT PERFORMANCE IS BUILT MAINLY THROUGH PRACTICE

2 SPATIAL ABILITY PLAYS A MAJOR PART IN CREATIVITY AND TECHNICAL INNOVATION AND IT'S GENERALLY OVERLOOKED IN ASSESSMENTS

WERE MORE LIKELY TO EARN DOCTORATES OR PATENTS AND MORE THAN TWICE AS LIKELY TO GET A PHD IN A STEM FIELD

GERMAN STUDIES ON GIFTED STUDENTS IN THE MID FOUND THAT COGNITIVE FACTORS WERE THE MOST PREDICTIVE BUT THAT SOME PERSONAL TRAITS SUCH AS MOTIVATION CURIOSITY AND ABILITY TO COPE WITH STRESS HAD A LIMITED INFLUENCE ON PERFORMANCE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS SUCH AS FAMILY SCHOOL AND PEERS ALSO HAD AN IMPACT

FOR INDIVIDUALS BEYOND A CERTAIN IQ BARRIER IS OFTEN CITED CONCENTRATED PRACTICE TIME IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN ADDITIONAL INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES IN ACQUIRING EXPERTISE



EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT ONE OF THOSE KIND OF PERSONS YOU CAN STILL DO IT AND PLENTY OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY DO
THIS IS RICHARD FEYNMAN ONE OF THE GREATEST PHYSICISTS AND THE JESUS OF PHYSICS FOR MANY PEOPLE

WATCH V
PEOPLE ON R PHYSICS DON'T HAVE THE EXPERTISE REQUIRED TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION MEANINGFULLY
I'M GONNA HAVE TO BE THE PARTY POOPER AND SAY PROBABLY NOT IF BY AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE YOU LITERALLY MEAN IQ

THE THING IS PEOPLE LIVE IN BUBBLES IF YOU'RE AN IQ PERSON YOU PROBABLY HAVE NO CLOSE FRIENDS WHO ARE OF IQ WHAT THE TYPICAL HIGH IQ PERSON THINKS OF AS AVERAGE IQ IS IN FACT VERY FAR ABOVE AVERAGE FRANKLY UNLESS YOU WORK IN A PROFESSION LIKE PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES OR PSYCHIATRY THAT ACTUALLY ENABLES YOU TO KNOW PEOPLE'S IQS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET A REAL FEEL FOR JUST WHAT IQ IQ IQ ACTUALLY MEAN


IN TERMS OF HARD NUMBERS THE AVERAGE IQ OF SOMEONE COMPLETING AN UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE IS AND THE AVERAGE IQ OF SOMEONE GETTING A PHD IS WITH SUBSTANTIAL VARIATION BETWEEN FIELDS PHYSICS AND MATH PHS TEND TO BE HIGHER IQ THAN THE AVERAGE PHD RECIPIENT WHAT'S MORE IF YOU BOTHER TO DIVIDE IQ SCORES INTO SPECIFIC SUBSECTIONS EAST G VERBAL MATHEMATICAL MATH PHYSICS PHS TEND TO BE LOPSIDED WHICH IS TO SAY THEIR RAW MATHEMATICAL IQ IS EVEN HIGHER ABOVE NORMAL THAN A LUMP IQ SCORE WOULD INDICATE


WHAT DOES THIS MEAN IT MEANS IF YOU REALLY TAKE SOMEONE WHO IS TRULY AT THE POPULATION AVERAGE OF MATHEMATICAL INTELLIGENCE AND STICK THEM IN A PHYSICS PHD PROGRAM THEY WILL BE MULTIPLE STANDARD DEVIATIONS BELOW THE AVERAGE LEVEL OF THEIR PEERS

AGAIN IF YOU DON'T FREQUENTLY WORK WITH A DIVERSE IQ POPULATION IT'S HARD TO GET A FEEL FOR WHAT THIS MEANS BUT LET ME TELL YOU IT MEANS A LOT


AND IN PARTICULAR IT MEANS EVEN MORE WHEN YOU CONSIDER BEYOND THE PHD COULD SOMEONE WHO IS UNTALENTED IN MATHEMATICS OBTAIN A MATH PHD THROUGH SHEER BRUTE DETERMINATION MAYBE BUT MAYBE NOT ARE THEY LIKELY TO OBTAIN VERY MUCH SUCCESS AS A MATHEMATICIAN EVEN APPLYING THE SAME BRUTE DETERMINATION MAYBE BUT MAYBE NOT AND CERTAINLY FAVORING THE MAYBE NOT MORE THAN THE PRIOR QUESTION


MY POINT BEING JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE COULD DOESN'T MEAN THEY SHOULD I COULD NOT ETHICALLY RECOMMEND BECOMING A PHYSICS PHD TO SOMEONE WHO IS GENUINELY AVERAGE AT A POPULATION LEVEL IN INTELLIGENCE FOR THE SAME REASON I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND SOMEONE WHO IS HARD OF HEARING BECOME A CONCERT MUSICIAN EVEN IF IT'S POSSIBLE IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND ONE HAS TO WONDER TO WHAT EXTENT SOMEONE WHO CAN NOT HEAR WOULD REALLY ENJOY BEING A MUSICIAN AND TO WHAT EXTENT SOMEONE WITH NO MATHEMATICAL TALENT OR SPATIAL ABILITY WHATSOEVER WOULD ENJOY BEING A PHYSICIST


THAT SAID I WANT TO REEMPHASIZE THAT WHAT YOU CONSIDER AVERAGE MIGHT IN FACT BE VERY FAR ABOVE AVERAGE LOOK UP IMPOSTER SYNDROME OFTENTIMES THE VERY BEST MOST TALENTED PEOPLE ON THE ENTIRE PLANET BELIEVE THEY ARE ONLY AVERAGE OR ONLY BELOW AVERAGE I DOUBT YOU'RE REALLY AS AVERAGE AS YOU THINK YOU ARE ASSUMING YOU'RE ASKING FOR YOURSELF YOU ARE ALMOST CERTAINLY MORE TALENTED THAN YOU THINK
YES
IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE

OTOH GETTING A PH D ISN'T LIKE GETTING A NOBEL PRIZE OR A TENURED PROFESSORSHIP IF YOU GRIND AWAY AT IT HARD ENOUGH IN THE RIGHT SITUATION YOU'LL GET A PH D BUT IT MIGHT NOT BE AT A GREAT INSTITUTION FROM A GREAT ADVISOR WITH A GREAT CAREER PATH AHEAD OF YOU IT'S HARD EVEN FOR SMART PEOPLE EVEN VERY SMART PH D S FROM TOP PROGRAMS OFTEN END UP DISILLUSIONED AND ON CAREER PATHS THAT DON'T INVOLVE PHYSICS

THAT SAID COMPARED TO AN UNDERGRADUATE PHYSICS MAJOR IT PROBABLY ISN'T GOING TO GET ANY EASIER AT LEAST PART OF THE PH D IS GOING TO REQUIRE PASSING A GENERAL EXAMINATION
I WON'T SIMPLY ANSWER WITH A YES OR NO BECAUSE YOUR QUESTION LEAVES NO ROOM FOR INTERPRETATION INTELLIGENCE IS A BROAD TERMS WHICH COVERS MANY AREAS FOR PHD IN PHYSICS YOU NEED TO HAVE GOOD VISUALIZATION SKILLS TO UNDERSTAND COMPLEX SYSTEMS AND THEIR INTERACTIVE BEHAVIOR ALSO YOU MUST HAVE A GOOD MEMORY SO TO RETAIN WHAT YOU HAVE LEARN

I SAY YOU SHOULD HAVE GOOD UNDERSTANDING SKILLS AND GRASPING POWER IF YOU WANT TO GET A PHD IN ANY FIELD HARD WORK CAN GET YOU THROUGH SOME TIGHT SPACE BUT THERE ARE ONLY HOURS IN A DAY AND YOU CAN'T WORK LIKE A MACHINE TO GET BETTER RESULTS SO PLAN YOUR SCHEDULE AND YOU WOULD DO OK
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE OVERESTIMATE THE AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE LEVEL MOST HS STUDENTS OF AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE HAVE POOR SPATIAL REASONING AND ABSTRACT THINKING SKILLS THESE ARE CRITICAL COMPONENTS TO PASSING INTRODUCTORY PHYSICS LET ALONE UPPER LEVEL OR GRADUATE WORK

MANY AVERAGE HS STUDENTS CAN'T VISUALIZE THE MAGNETIC FIELD AROUND A LONG STRAIGHT WIRE POINTING IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS NOT SURE HOW THEY COULD BE EXPECTED TO UNDERSTAND A VECTOR FIELD AND FURTHER CALCULATE THE DIV GRAD CURL ETC

PLENTY OF AVERAGE STUDENTS CAN'T ACCURATELY FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS IN THEIR HS CHEMISTRY CLASS BUT SOMEHOW THEY'RE GOING TO DESIGN AND CONDUCT THE INDEPENDENT RESEARCH NEEDED TO WRITE A DISSERTATION

THERE'S A REASON THAT QUANTUM MECHANICS IS USED SO OFTEN IN WOO IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT CONCEPT THAT ISN'T UNDERSTOOD BY THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE SO THEY TREAT IT AS MAGIC IN THE REAL WORLD THAT CAN EXPLAIN ANYTHING

COULD A PERSON OF AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE EARN A PHD IN PHYSICS PERHAPS BUT I FIND IT VERY UNLIKELY IF THEY WERE GROOMED FROM A VERY EARLY AGE THEY MIGHT HAVE A SHOT IF YOU TAKE A RANDOM MOTIVATED HS GRADUATE OF AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE AND PUT THEM IN A PHD TRACK THEY'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT
THE WORLD DOESN'T OPERATE IN EXTREMES CAN AN AVERAGE PERSON BECOME A PHYSICIST SURE IS IT LIKELY NOPE

PHYSICS IS HARD FOR SMART PEOPLE WHAT IN THE FUCK IS IT FOR NORMAL PEOPLE
YES CERTAINLY THE GRE TEST IS THE PERFECT ILLUSTRATOR OF THIS THE GRE IS DESIGNED TO PREDICT GRAD SCHOOL PERFORMANCE SO IT WAS VALIDATED BY COMPARING GRE SCORES TO GRADUATION RATES THE GRE IS ALSO HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH IQ LIKE MOST STANDARDIZED EXAMS

THE RESULT IS THAT FOR PEOPLE WHO SCORE IN THE MIDDLE PERCENTILE THERE IS NO CORRELATION BETWEEN GRE SCORE INTELLIGENCE AND GRADUATION LIKELIHOOD IT DOES A REASONABLY GOOD JOB AT PREDICTING THE OBVIOUS NAMELY THAT VERY SMART PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO GET A PHD THAN VERY DUMB PEOPLE

IF YOU GET ANYTHING OVER 10TH PERCENTILE ON THE GRE THEN YOU SHOULD GO TO GRAD SCHOOL IF YOU WANT TO
DEPENDS ON YOUR AFFINITY FOR MATHEMATICS SOMETIMES PEOPLE WHO ARE GOOD AT IT TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT ANYBODY CAN DO IT I PERSONALLY MADE IT THROUGH SECOND SEMESTER CALCULUS WITH I THINK A DECENT UNDERSTANDING BUT AFTER THAT I WAS LOST BUT BY NO MEANS SHOULD YOU LET YOUR PERCEPTION OF YOUR INTELLIGENCE WHATEVER IT IS DISSUADE YOU FROM TRYING IF THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
I KNOW LOTS OF PEOPLE WITH IN PHYSICS THAT ARE PRETTY STUPID IN MAY INSTITUTIONS IT'S NOT THE INTELLIGENCE IT'S THE THAT PAYS OFFICIAL
I'M AVERAGE GRADUATED MIDDLE OF MY CLASS IN UNDERGRAD ALWAYS HAVING A HARD TIME KEEPING UP BUT I GOT INTO A PHD PROGRAM ITS BEEN TOUGH BUT I LOVE IT MY PEERS IN GRAD SCHOOL ARE MUCH FURTHER AHEAD OF MY IN PHYSICS BUT HERE I AM CHUGGING ALONG
YES I'M DOING IT RIGHT NOW
ABSOLUTELY THEY CAN GETTING THROUGH PHYSICS IS JUST A MATTER OF PUTTING IN THE TIME LET'S SAY YOU READ THROUGH A TEXTBOOK CHAPTER AND DON'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT SO YOU READ IT AGAIN AND STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND IT YOU'RE GOING TO GET FRUSTRATED AND WANT TO QUIT WELL HERE'S WHAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE ARE YOU WILLING TO READ IT AGAIN AND AGAIN TAKING HANDWRITTEN NOTES EACH TIME AND CONSULTING ALTERNATIVE TEXTBOOKS AND ONLINE RESOURCES UNTIL IT DOES MAKE SENSE ARE YOU WILLING TO GIVE UP YOUR NIGHTS AND WEEKENDS MASTERING THE MATERIAL IF THE ANSWER IS YES THEN YOU CAN GET A PHD BEING SMART HELPS BUT ISN'T THE REAL DETERMINING FACTOR
I WOULD LOVE MORE THAN MOST THINGS I CAN THINK OF TO LEARN PHYSICS BUT I'M INEPT WHEN IT COMES TO MATHEMATICS WHAT HOPE FOR ME
IN MY EXPERIENCE THERE IS A CUT OFF WHEREIN INCREASING INTELLIGENCE HAS LITTLE EFFECT ON YOUR SUCCESS AS A RESEARCHER BELOW THAT INTELLIGENCE CUT OFF GRADUATE STUDENTS REALLY STRUGGLE BECAUSE THEY TEND TO ASK THE WRONG RESEARCH QUESTIONS THEY SPEND TIME ON UNNECESSARY EXPERIMENTS DESIGN EXPERIMENTS POORLY AND MISINTERPRET RESULTS THE STUDENTS ABOVE THAT THRESHOLD SEEM TO HAVE SUCCESS THAT IS MUCH MORE CLOSELY TIED TO THEIR WORK ETHIC THAN INTELLIGENCE LEVEL

THE FIRST STUDENT TO GRADUATE FROM MY COHORT DID IT IN ABOUT YEARS BECAUSE SHE WAS JUST GOOD AT GETTING SHIT DONE SHE WAS AT THE LOWER END OF INTELLIGENCE OUT OF OUR CLASS BASED ON COURSE WORK AND OTHER INTELLIGENCE INDICATORS BUT SHE WAS INTELLIGENT ENOUGH

AS FOR YOUR ORIGINAL QUESTION I'M NOT SURE IF AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE IS ENOUGH OR NOT PHYSICS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST INTELLECTUALLY DEMANDING FIELDS TO WORK IN IN OTHER DOCTORAL DEGREES I THINK THAT INTELLIGENCE THRESHOLD DROPS A BIT FULL DISCLOSURE I'M A CHEMISTRY GUY WHO SOMEHOW GOT INTO A PHYSICS INTENSIVE DISSERTATION PROJECT
I CONSIDER MYSELF TO BE OF AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE I THINK ANYONE CAN LEARN MATERIAL WITH ENOUGH WORK IT'S THE ORIGINAL RESEARCH PART THAT WOULD PREVENT SOMEONE LIKE ME FROM THAT LAST STEP WORKING HARD TO LEARN MATERIAL IS POSSIBLE COMING UP WITH ORIGINAL RESEARCH IS ANOTHER STORY
DEFINITELY YES
I SHOULD PERHAPS HAVE QUALIFIED MY STATEMENT BY BEING CLEARER IN THAT WHEN I ASKED WHAT HOPE FOR ME IT WAS A MERE STATEMENT AND NOT AN INVITATION TO ASK WHAT MY CHANCES WERE

THANKS ALL THE SAME
IT IS HARD ALREADY TO GET A BACHELOR DEGREE SO YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW HARD PHD WOULD BE HARD LIKE MED SCHOOL LEVEL
I'M ASSUMING YOU ARE ASKING THIS QUESTION AT THE END OF A BACHELOR OR MASTERS LEVEL PHYSICS DEGREE IF YOU WERE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THAT WITH ENOUGH MARKS TO ENTER A PHD PROGRAM THEN YOU ARE SMART ENOUGH

IF BEN CARSON CAN BECOME A NEUROSURGEON THEN YOU CAN BECOME A PHYSICS PHD
I'LL GET MINE IN A SOME MONTHS AND FROM MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE MYSELF I'D SAY DEFINITELY SOMEONE OF AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE CAN

IT TAKES A LOT OF HARD WORK AND LONG HOURS WHEN NEED BE BUT AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A SUPERVISOR YOU LIKE WORKING WITH AND A NICE GROUP AND YOU ENJOY THE PHYSICS YOU'RE STUDYING THEN YOU'LL BE FINE THOSE ARE FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN GRADES I'VE SEEN PEOPLE WITH BAD GRADES DO GREAT AND POOR GRADES HATE IT AND QUIT IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT INTELLIGENCE AT THAT LEVEL BECAUSE IT BECOMES A JOB AND A LIFE NOT JUST A DEGREE OR QUALIFICATION DON'T DO IT FOR THAT REASON

A SMALL COROLLARY IS THAT THIS APPLIES TO EXPERIENCES I'VE HAD KNOW ABOUT IN EUROPE I THINK THIS MAY NOT BE THE CASE IN THE US WHERE THE BALANCE IS MORE SKEWED FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD
TOO MUCH IS MADE IN THIS THREAD ABOUT MATHEMATICAL SOPHISTICATION AND STUDYING PHYSICS THERE CERTAINLY IS A CEILING BINDING MATHEMATICAL ABILITIES BUT IT'S REALLY HIGH REAL INTELLECTUAL QUALITY ENTAILS PUTTING DOWN IDEAS IN MATHEMATICAL FORM INTERPRETING MATHEMATICAL EQUATIONS ON PHYSICAL TERMS UNDERSTANDING WHEN TO APPROXIMATE AND WHEN TO POWER FOR THE EXACT SOLUTION ETC

BUT THE ABOVE SKILLS AREN'T BASED ON BEING ABLE TO SOLVE COMPLICATED EQUATIONS OR MANIPULATING THEM THEY ARE BASED ON IMAGINATION AND LOGIC FOR EXAMPLE IF ONE UNDERSTANDS WHEN TO USE A HAMILTONIAN VS A LAGRANGIAN THEN ONE UNDERSTANDS THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM

IF BY AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE YOU MEAN A PERSON WITH AN IQ OF WHICH IS THE IQ VALUE OF AN AVERAGE PERSON BY DEFINITION IT IS HIGHLY DOUBTFUL THAT SUCH A PERSON CAN GET A PHD IN PHYSICS NO MATTER HOW HARD THEY WORK
THIS IS CLEARLY A QUESTION CAUSING A LOT OF DEBATE I'LL THROW MY TWO CENTS IN AND SAY YES I TRULY BELIEVE THAT ANYONE CAN MAKE A PHD LEVEL CONTRIBUTION IN PHYSICS GIVEN THEY ARE OF AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE THAT'S A PRETTY NEBULOUS TERM SO I WON'T TRY TO DEFINE IT TOO MUCH ESPECIALLY NOT WITH IQ WHICH IS NOT A WELL FOUNDED CONCEPT EITHER
FROM EXPERIENCE I BELIEVE THAT THE BIGGEST FACTOR IN LEARNING PHYSICS IS A PERSONS ABILITY TO EXPLAIN THINGS TO THEMSELVES YOU DON'T NEED TO BE ABLE TO VISUALIZE THE THING YOU DON'T NEED TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE EQUATIONS AND JUST GET THEM YOU DON'T NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO ANY OF IT THE THING YOU NEED TO DO THE ONLY THING YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO IS EXPLAIN THE CONCEPTS TO YOURSELF AND BE ABLE TO TRANSLATE THEM INTO THE COMMON LANGUAGE OF MATHEMATICS FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT IS PICTURING IT OR SEEING THE EQUATIONS AND UNDERSTANDING OR SOME OTHER METHOD THE PROBLEM FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IS THEY NEVER DEVELOP A CONSISTENT WAY TO EXPLAIN THINGS TO THEMSELVES
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW TO GET A PHD IN PHYSICS I WOULD SAY FIRST FIND WITHIN YOURSELF THE MOTIVATION FOR IT AND SECOND FIGURE OUT HOW TO LEARN IF YOU HAVE MOTIVATION AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW YOU PERSONALLY LEARN YOU CAN MANAGE IT THESE ARE TWO THINGS THAT CAN EACH TAKE YEARS TO DEVELOP HOWEVER A LOT OF PEOPLE GET TO THE POINT WHERE THEY RECOGNIZE THE MATERIAL AND THINK THEY A MASTERED IT WHEN IT COMES TIME TO USE IT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY CAN'T PULL IT OUT OF MEMORY SOME PEOPLE NEVER GO THROUGH THE TROUBLE TO REALLY ORGANIZE THE FACTS IN THEIR MINDS AND THEN THEY CAN'T RELATE THE CONCEPTS TO EACH OTHER AND IT'S JUST A LIST OF FORMULAS IN THEIR HEAD
I THINK THERE IS INNATE INTELLIGENCE BUT I THINK THE THING THAT FAR OUTSTRIPS IT IS AN ABILITY TO LEARN AND TO LEARN EFFICIENTLY I ALMOST FAILED ALGEBRA THE FIRST TIME I TOOK IT THEN I BECAME INTERESTED IN PHYSICS AND DID EXTREMELY WELL IN THE CLASS BECAUSE I WAS READING IT FOR INTEREST AND TICKED MYSELF INTO LEARNING THE MATERIAL IN A WAY I COULDN'T BY SITTING DOWN AND COPYING FORMULAS FROM THAT I DEVELOPED A WAY TO LEARN AND THEN COULD MOVE FORWARD
THERE IS AN ELITISM IN DIFFICULT PROFESSIONS THIS IDEA THAT WE'VE MADE IT SOMEWHERE BECAUSE WE'VE GOT THESE MINDS THAT ARE JUST PERFECT FOR IT THOSE PEOPLE EXIST BUT THEY ARE THE RAREST KIND OF PERSON PEOPLE AS A WHOLE ARE VERY GOOD AT A HUGE VARIETY OF TASKS I DOUBT I COULD WALK INTO AN ENGLISH DEPARTMENT AND DO THAT WELL AT FIRST AND I MIGHT ASK CAN A PERSON OF AVERAGE CREATIVITY EVER MANAGE TO GET A PHD IN ENGLISH THE ANSWER WOULD BE THE SAME YES BUT YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DIGEST THE MATERIAL UNTIL IT IS AS FAMILIAR TO YOU AS ADDITION OR THE ABCS
LOWER THAN AVERAGE INTELLIGENT PEOPLE CAN GET A PHD MOST ADVICE YOU GET COMES FROM LESS THAN AVERAGE INTELLIGENT PEOPLE DON'T LISTEN TO ANYONE AND JUST DO WHAT YOU WANT
I SOME HOW GOT A HONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS AND I DID FUCK ALL WORK WENT TO ABOUT LECTURES OVER THE YEARS AND GOT HAMMED MOST NIGHTS I MANAGED TO GET SOME PHD OFFERS SO I'M SURE YOU COULD EASILY MANAGE IT IF YOU WERE ACTUALLY TRYING
ABSOLUTELY NOT POSSIBLE GETTING A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IS ALSO OUT OF REACH THE KEY HERE IS THAT REALLY SMART PEOPLE ARE ALREADY WORKING VERY HARD TO FINISH THESE DEGREES A PERSON OF AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE MAY BE ABLE FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY NEED TO BUT IT WILL TAKE WAY LONGER THAN THE YEARS PERMITTED TO STAY IN THESE PROGRAMS
IS IT THAT THE TIME VELOCITY IS CONVERTED INTO SPACIAL VELOCITY

THIS IS AWFULLY CLOSE TO THE ANSWER THE ANSWER GEOMETRICALLY SIMILAR TO THE SITUATION THAT YOU CANNOT CREATE PARALLEL LINES ON A SPHERE'S SURFACE
OR THIS
UPLOADS

NOTICE HOW ON A SPHERE'S SURFACE THERE IS A DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTIC THAT YOU CAN CREATE A POLYGON WITH TWO SIDES IF YOU TAKE TWO STRAIGHT LINES AND CARRY THEM TO EACH POLE THEY WILL MEET UP BECAUSE THE SURFACE IS CURVED THE ANSWER IS THAT ALL OBSERVERS INERTIAL FOLLOW STRAIGHT LINES ON A CURVED SURFACE OF SPACE TIME CALLED GEODESICS AS LONG AS SPACE TIME IS CURVED IT MEANS THAT TWO STRAIGHT WORLD LINES THAT ARE INITIALLY PARALLEL IN SPACETIME THIS LITERALLY MEANS AT REST RELATIVE TO ONE ANOTHER CAN INTERSECT WITHOUT ANY CURVING THE WORLD LINES ACCELERATION OR RELATIVE MOTION

HERE IS AN INTERACTIVE DEMONSTRATION VISUALIZATION WHAT IS GOING ON
PHYSICS

REALIZE THAT NO ONE CAN REALLY VISUALIZE WHAT IS GOING ON NOT EVEN EINSTEIN COULD THE MATHEMATICS IS OUR LANGUAGE FOR UNDERSTANDING IT BUT OUR VISUAL CORTEX IS SIMPLY INCAPABLE OF TRULY VISUALIZING CURVED SPACETIME IN THE ANIMATION POSTED THERE IS ONLY ONE DIMENSION OF SPACE AND ONE DIMENSION OF TIME THIS MEANS WE NEED A 2D SURFACE THAT IS CURVED VISUALIZED AS BENDING IN A THIRD DIMENSION THIS IS CALLED AN EMBEDDING DIAGRAM TO VISUALIZE CURVED SPACETIME WE'D NEED TO BE CAPABLE OF THINKING IN FIVE SPACIAL DIMENSIONS
THIS ISN'T A GREAT EXPLANATION BUT IT'S SOMETHING MAYBE LATER I'LL COME UP WITH SOMETHING BETTER

PARTICLES MOVE THROUGH SPACETIME TRYING TO MAXIMIZE THE PROPER TIME ALONG THEIR TRAJECTORY MORE PRECISELY GIVEN INITIAL AND FINAL POSITIONS AT FIXED TIMES THE PATH THAT THE PARTICLE TAKES IS THE ONE WITH THE GREATEST PROPER TIME

NOW SUPPOSE YOU HAVE A BALL THAT STARTS AND ENDS AT THE SAME POSITION SAY THE TOP OF THE TOWER AT GIVEN TIMES FOR A FIXED INTERVAL OF COORDINATE TIME THERE IS MORE PROPER TIME HIGHER UP SO THE BALL WILL WANT TO SPEND MOST OF ITS TIME UP HIGH ONLY COMING BACK WHEN ITS TIME IS ALMOST OVER IN OTHER WORDS IF IT STARTS OUT GOING UP THEN LATER IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN IT MAKES SENSE TO SAY THAT IF IT STARTS OUT WITH ZERO VERTICAL VELOCITY ITS FATE WILL BE TO END UP LOWER THAN IT STARTED TO END UP AT THE SAME HEIGHT IT NEEDS A POSITIVE INITIAL VELOCITY
A BALL AT REST THAT STARTS FALLING CAN BE EXPLAINED IN GR IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY AS IN NEWTONIAN GRAVITY THAT'S BECAUSE NEWTONIAN GRAVITY CAN BE FORMULATED IN TERMS OF A CURVED SPACETIME AS WELL THE ONLY CONCEPTUAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NEWTONIAN GRAVITY AND GR IS THAT THE FORMER USES A RIEMANNIAN MANIFOLD WHEREAS THE LATTER USES A LORENTZIAN ONE IF THIS WEREN'T THE CASE IT WOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE FOR GR TO REDUCE TO NEWTONIAN GRAVITY IN THE NONRELATIVISTIC LIMIT INCIDENTALLY GR CAN ALSO BE FORMULATED IN TERMS OF A STATIC BACKGROUND AND A FORCE LIKE CLASSICAL NEWTONIAN GRAVITY BUT THAT IS QUITE MORE COMPLICATED AND IN SOME WAYS LESS NATURAL

THERE IS ONE VERY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE WHEN ONE GOES TO THE CURVED SPACETIME VIEW HOWEVER IN CLASSICAL NEWTONIAN GRAVITY A BALL AT REST IS REALLY AT REST AND IT STARTS ACCELERATING IN A GRAVITATIONAL FIELD WHEN LET GO ON THE OTHER HAND IN GRAVITY A BALL AT REST IS REALLY ACCELERATING BECAUSE IT IS NOT FOLLOWING A GEODESIC WHEREAS IT STARTS FOLLOWING A GEODESIC IN UNACCELERATED MOTION ONLY WHEN LET GO AND INDEED AN ACCELEROMETER AT REST ON THE EARTH MEASURES AN ACCELERATION G AND IT MEASURES NO ACCELERATION WHEN FREELY FALLING

EDIT THIS VIDEO EXPLAINS THIS PHENOMENON VISUALLY NOTICE THAT THE CURVED LINES ARE REALLY STRAIGHT UNACCELERATED LINES BUT THEY APPEAR CURVED BECAUSE THE SPACETIME HAS BEEN DISTORTED THE SAME THING HAPPENS BOTH IN GR AND GRAVITY
IS IT THAT THE TIME VELOCITY IS CONVERTED INTO SPACIAL VELOCITY

THIS IS ESSENTIALLY CORRECT BOTH SPACE AND TIME CURVE SUCH THAT MOTION INITIALLY IN THE TEMPORAL DIRECTION BECOMES MOTION IN A SPATIAL DIRECTION

THIS IS MORE EASILY VISUALIZED IN THIS VIDEO WITH A CONTRAPTION TO HELP VISUALIZE WHAT IT MEANS FOR TIME TO BE CURVED

AND THE REASON THE OBJECT MOVES IS BECAUSE WHEN THE BALL MOVES SLOWER IN TIME IT HAS LESS ENERGY

THIS PART IS NOT CORRECT HOWEVER A BALL MOVING SLOWER IN TIME WILL HAVE MORE KINETIC ENERGY NOT LESS

HOPE THAT HELPS
ALL OBJECTS FALL AT THE SAME RATE REGARDLESS OF THEIR MASSACHUSETTS UNLIKE IN ELECTROMAGNETISM WHERE THE CHARGE DOES MATTER MASS GENERATES GRAVITY BUT THE MOTION OF THE OBJECT DOES NOT DEPEND ON THE OBJECTS MASSACHUSETTS THIS IS UNLIKE MOST OTHER FORCES WE SEE

SO WE POSTULATE THAT MASS DOES NOT GENERATE A FORCE FIELD INSTEAD MASS AFFECTS THE GEOMETRY AROUND IT SINCE IT AFFECTS ALL OBJECTS THE SAME SINCE OBJECTS CLEARLY MOVE AS TIME PASSES WE MUST FIND A WAY TO UNIFY SPACIAL AND TIME COMPONENTS INTO OUR GEOMETRY WE CALL THIS SPACETIME

FIRST WE MUST PASS FROM GEOMETRY WITHOUT TIME INCLUDED TO SPACETIME A METRIC ASSIGNS A POSITIVE REAL NUMBER TO EVERY PAIR OF VECTORS A BIG EXAMPLE IS LENGTH IN ORDINARY GEOMETRY IT IS GIVEN BY

DL 2 DX 2 DY 2 DZ 2

NOTE THAT THE LENGTH OF AN OBJECT IS INVARIANT BETWEEN DIFFERENT OBSERVERS A RIGID INDESTRUCTIBLE ROD OF LENGTH L WILL ALWAYS BE LENGTH L REGARDLESS OF WHATEVER TRANSFORMATIONS YOU APPLY TO IT'S COORDINATES ROTATIONS AND TRANSLATIONS IN OTHER WORDS

DL 2 DX 2 DY 2 DZ 2 DL 2

IN SPECIAL RELATIVITY THE KEY LAW IS THAT THE LENGTH OF AN OBJECT IS NOT INVARIANT INSTEAD A NEW QUANTITY CALLED THE INTERVAL IS INVARIANT

DS 2 C 2 DT 2 DX 2 DY 2 DZ 2

FROM HERE ON TAKE UNITS WHERE C SO M SOUTH THE REAL MEANING BEHIND E MC 2 IS THAT E M OR IN OTHER WORDS ENERGY IS MASSACHUSETTS THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM WE DEFINE THE REST MASS OF AN OBJECT AS ITS ENERGY WHEN IN A REST FRAME

IN GENERAL RELATIVITY WE TAKE THIS IDEA FURTHER SETTING T X Y Z THE INTERVAL CAN BE WRITTEN

DS 2 SUM FROM U V TO

WHERE ARE REAL NUMBERS THE COMPONENTS OF THE METRIC IN FLAT SPACE THE CASE FROM SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND ALL OTHER

THE EINSTEIN FIELD EQUATIONS DETERMINE FROM THE STRESS ENERGY TENSOR FOR THE REST OF THIS PARAGRAPH REMEMBER MASS AND ENERGY ARE THE SAME THING THE STRESS ENERGY COMPONENTS ARE JUST ENERGY DENSITY THROUGH ARE FLOW OF ENERGY ACROSS X AND Z AXES THROUGH ARE DENSITY OF MOMENTUM IN THE X AND Z DIRECTIONS LASTLY ARE FLOW OF COMPONENT OF MOMENTUM ACROSS AXIS NOTE THAT

BASICALLY THE EINSTEIN FIELD EQUATIONS TELL US THAT THE FLOW AND DENSITY OF MASS GENERATES THE METRIC FOR SPACETIME WHICH WE INTERPRET AS CURVING GEOMETRY THE KEY THING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT WITH THE INTERVAL DS 2 TIME AND LENGTH ARE BOTH NECESSARY TO CONSTRUCT AN INVARIANT QUANTITY UNLIKE IN EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRY WHERE YOU ONLY NEED SPACIAL COMPONENTS
PRETTY BIG

UNIVERSITY PHYSICS DEPARTMENTS TYPICALLY HAVE A FEW SEMINARS A WEEK ON DIFFERENT TOPICS MOST OF THEM ARE HIGHLY TECHNICAL A FEW ARE AIMED AT A MORE GENERAL AUDIENCE COLLOQUIA MANY OF THEM HAVE FOOD

HERE FOR EXAMPLE ARE THE UPCOMING SEMINARS AT BERKELEY THE BAY AREA IS A BIT OF A HUB
UCLA PHYSICS SEMINARS ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC THEY HAVE A CALENDAR ON THEIR WEBSITE
IF YOU HAVE INTERESTS IN ASTROPHYSICS AND OR PLANETARY SCIENCE THE SETI INSTITUTE HOSTS A REGULAR TUESDAY OPEN COLLOQUIUM AT MOUNTAIN VIEW CAMPUS IN THE SF BAY AREA TYPICALLY THE HOUR TALKS ARE GIVEN BY VISITING PROFESSORS AND RESEARCHERS IN THE FIELD SOMETIMES BY SETI SCIENTISTS AND THEY EVEN POST THE VIDEOS OF THE TALKS ONLINE IF YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO ATTEND A WONDERFUL RESOURCE

ONE GOOD VISUALISATION OF DIVERGENCE I HAVE COMES FROM THEOREM

REMEMBER HOW THE DIVERGENCE OF THE VELOCITY FIELD IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE RATE OF CHANGE OF THE PHASE VOLUME YOU CAN SEE HOW THIS QUANTITY PHYSICALLY INFLUENCES THE GROWTH OR SHRINKAGE OF A CERTAIN VOLUME OF A FLUID

THUS I IMAGINE DIVERGENCE TO BE SOMETHING LIKE A MEASURE OF HOW MUCH A SOURCE OR SINK A POINT IS

SIMILARLY IT SERVES ONE WELL TO THINK OF CURL IN TERMS OF A MOVING FLUID CURL IS A MEASURE OF HOW MUCH THE FIELD OR THE FLUID IS TWISTING ABOUT AN AXIS OF FLOW

IMAGINE KEEPING A BEAD ON A CIRCULAR WIRE WITH THE AXIS PARALLEL TO THE FLOW IF THERE WERE ANY ROTATION TWISTING IN THE FLUID THE BEAD WOULD MOVE AROUND

CURL IS DEFINED AS THE CIRCULATION PER UNIT AREA WHICH IS ANALOGOUS TO THE WORK DONE AROUND A CLOSED CURVE IF THE FLUID HAS A ROTATING COMPONENT THIS WORK DONE WILL OBVIOUSLY BE AS THE ROTATION WILL LEAD TO TANGENTIAL COMPONENTS OF FORCE ALONG THE LOOP

SO THE CURL IS SIMPLY HOW MUCH A FLUID ROTATES ABOUT THE AXIS OF FLOW


INTUITIVELY I STARTED OFF THINKING OF IT LIKE A TANK OF WATER WHERE DIVERGENCE REPRESENTS A FLOW IN OR OUT OF THE TANK A PLUG OR A HOSE AND THE CURL REPRESENTS THE SWIRLING OF THE LIQUID AROUND A GIVEN AXIS NOW I JUST THINK OF VECTOR FIELDS AS LOADS OF TINY ARROWS WHOSE MAGNITUDE IS DEPENDENT ON FIELD STRENGTH

EDIT THIS MIGHT HELP
FERMI LIQUIDS OBEY VARIOUS CONSERVATION LAWS SIMILAR TO FLUIDS HAVE A SO-CALLED HYDRODYNAMIC REGIME FOR CERTAIN ENERGY LENGTH SCALES AND HAVE THE EQUIVALENT OF SOUND


HOWEVER FERMI LIQUIDS ARE MUCH RICHER IN PHYSICS THAN ORDINARY FLUIDS INSTEAD OF OBEYING JUST A SIMPLE BOLTZMANN EQUATION AS A GAS WOULD THEY OBEY A MORE COMPLICATED LANDAU KINETIC EQUATION NATURALLY THE USUAL CONSERVATION LAWS ARE AT PLAY ENERGY CHARGE ETC THOUGH IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT SOME OF THESE LAWS ONLY APPLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE INTERACTION OF THE FERMI LIQUID WITH OTHER EXCITATIONS SUCH AS PHONONS FERMI LIQUIDS ALSO HAVE MULTIPLE TYPES OF VIBRATIONS ZERO SOUND FIRST SOUND ETC SOME OF WHICH ARE NOT FOUND IN ANY ORDINARY FLUID


TO SUMMARIZE EVERYTHING IN A SINGLE SENTENCE I THINK IT IS BEST TO UNDERSTAND A FERMI LIQUID AS A DESCRIPTION OF QUANTUM PLASMA PHYSICS

THE BEST REFERENCE ON THE TOPIC IS PINES AND NOZIERRES TEXT ON FERMI LIQUIDS BAM AND PETRICK IS GOOD TOO BOTH TEXTS GO INTO A LOT OF DETAIL ON YOUR QUESTION MUCH MORE THAN I CAN WRITE HERE

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR SOLUTION AND THE GIVEN SOLUTION IS THAT YOU DIDN'T USE THE STEP THAT IT MUST BE TRUE FOR ALL X YOU ONLY DID THE X CASE IF YOU DID THE X PI CASE YOU COULD HAVE RECOVERED A SECOND SOLUTION IF YOU DID THAT IN YOUR WAY I BELIEVE YOU WOULD GET A SOLUTION OF X K L WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE FOR A SECOND ORDER DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION YOU SHOULD GET TWO LINEARLY INDEPENDENT SOLUTIONS

TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY YOUR SOLUTIONS DONE IN YOUR METHOD SHOULD GIVE

PSI PSI PSI COS L

PSI PSI PSI SIN L

AND UP TO NORMALIZATION YOUR ANSWER WOULD BE CORRECT ASSUMING BOUNDARY CONDITIONS WORK OUT WHICH IS WHY YOU GOT THE RIGHT ENERGY LEVELS

FOR COEFFICIENTS IT IS BECAUSE WAVEFUNCTIONS NEED TO BE NORMALIZED

NO OH GOD NO IT ACTUALLY SKIPS OVER A LOT OF BASIC QUANTUM MECHANICS SAKURAI FOR IT'S FIRST HALF AT LEAST IS MORE OF A TOUR DE FORCE OF SELECTED BASIC CONCEPTS PRESENTED IN A MORE ADVANCED FASHION YOU WILL NOT LEARN QM FROM SAKURAI

SHANKAR IS POPULAR SOME PEOPLE LIKE GRIFFITH IS DEFINITELY THE MOST UNIQUE AND UNDERGRAD ORIENTED AT THE SAME TIME UNLIKE HIS E M BOOK IT'S NOT THAT GOOD AND THE SAME TIME THERE'S REALLY NO GOOD UNDERGRAD FIRST TIME QM BOOK UNLESS YOU HAVE A LOT MORE MATH UNDER YOUR BELT THAN THE AVERAGE FIRST TIMER
SAKURAI IS GREAT BUT IT IS NOT AN INTRODUCTORY TEXT I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT ANY MODERN BOOKS BUT TOWNSEND AS SUGGESTED ABOVE HAS BEEN RECOMMENDED BY OTHERS
OF THE BOOKS LISTED YOU SHOULD GO WITH SHANKAR AND THIS IS COMING FROM A HUGE L L FAN

OF COURSE IT NEVER HURTS TO USE MULTIPLE RESOURCES IF YOU'RE PLANNING ON GRAD SCHOOL YOU'LL LIKELY NEED SAKURAI EVENTUALLY
I USED SAKURAI FOR MY GRADUATE LEVEL QM CLASSICAL IT WAS AN OK BOOK GIVEN THAT I HAD ALREADY SAT TWO SEMESTERS OF UNDERGRAD QM HOWEVER I WOULD NOT SUGGEST IT AS AN INTRODUCTION EVEN IF YOU ARE HIGHLY TRAINED IN MATHEMATICS IMO THE ORDER AND WAY THE TOPICS ARE PRESENTED IN SAKURAI ONLY MAKE A LOT OF SENSE IF YOU HAVE A GENERAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE FUNDAMENTALS OF QM

IF YOU'RE SET ON IT ANYWAY I'D TAKE A COUPLE LOWER LEVEL BOOKS ALONG FOR THE RIDE TO REFERENCE GRIFFITHS GASIOROWICZ AND MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE THE RELEVANT PORTIONS OF FEYNMAN LECTURES
PAULING LINUS

ISN'T THIS MORE TOWARDS CHEMISTS
USE A MODERN APPROACH TO QUANTUM MECHANICS BY TOWNSEND SAKURAI IS TOO ADVANCED FOR A FIRST INTRODUCTION BUT GOOD FOR A THIRD COURSE IN QM
IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT YET DO A QUICK GOOGLE SEARCH AND TRY TO FIND HIS MOST RECENT PAPERS TRY TO READ THEM AND AT LEAST HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT IT'S ABOUT YOU'LL PROBABLY WON'T UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING BUT SOME QUESTIONS WILL POP OUT IN YOUR HEAD DURING THE INTERVIEW YOUR PROFESSOR MAY TELL YOU SOME OF HIS CURRENT PROJECTS AND YOU'LL ALREADY HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY OR ASK ABOUT IT

ALSO DON'T SAY THAT YOU KNOW HOW TO USE SOME SOFTWARE IF YOU DON'T EVEN IF YOU KNOW HOW IT WORKS GLOBALLY FROM AN OUTSIDE PERSPECTIVE SOMEONE CAN EASILY TELL IF YOU'RE LYING BY ASKING YOU SOME SPECIFIC QUESTION ABOUT THAT SOFTWARE INSTEAD TELL HIM THAT YOU HAVEN'T HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRY IT BUT THAT YOU COULD DO SOME TUTORIALS BY YOURSELF BEFORE STARTING WORKING FOR HIM
IT SHOWS MOTIVATION AUTONOMY AND COMMITMENT WHICH ARE ARGUABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT QUALITY FOR AN UNDERGRAD
SECONDED ON THE LOOK UP WHAT THEY DO HAVE RECENTLY DONE FRONT SHOWING INTEREST IN THE WORK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

I'D ALSO SAY THAT IF YOU GET ASKED ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND BE COMPLETELY HONEST BUT OPTIMISTIC ABOUT LEARNING NEW THINGS CHANCES ARE YOU HAVE NO PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE IN THE FIELD HE WORKS IN BUT THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO REASON YOU CAN'T QUICKLY LEARN AND IF YOU'RE CONFIDENT IN THAT FACT HE WILL BE TOO CITE YOUR ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE IF THAT BOLSTERS YOUR CASE ON THAT FRONT

LASTLY REMEMBER THAT CHANCES ARE HE'S LOOKING FORWARD TO TEACHING YOU SOME STUFF AND LETTING YOU LOOSE ON A PROBLEM OR SHOWING YOU THE ROPES AND GIVING YOU SOME LAB TASKS TO HANDLE IN MY EXPERIENCE PROFESSORS THAT LIKE DOING RESEARCH WITH UNDERGRADS ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT ADDING TO THEIR GROUP AND MENTORING NEW PEOPLE IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THE OUTCOME WILL BE WORSE THAN TAKE THIS CLASS AND KEEP IN TOUCH I'LL HAVE SOME STUFF FOR YOU SOON UNLESS YOU'RE COMPETING FOR A PAID POSITION OR SOMETHING

GOOD LUCK
THIS ALL SEEMS REALLY QUITE WEIRD TO ME WHEN I WANT TO WORK WITH A PROFESSOR I JUST BLUNTLY ASK IF THEY WILL HAVE ME SO FAR IT HAS WORKED RATHER WELL FOR ME THIS METHOD HAS TAKEN ME TO THE ARCTIC AND HAS LEAD ME INTO QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT RESEARCH
I BELIEVE ITS BECAUSE THEY USE VERY LARGE DIAMETER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT DISHES ON THE GROUND BUT NEED TO USE A MUCH SMALLER RECEIVER ON THE SATELLITE ITSELF WHICH AFFECTS LINK CAPACITY
SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THE GROUND CAN INTERFACE WITH MORE THAN ONE SATELLITE SIMULTANEOUSLY FOR FASTER SPEEDS
NUMBER AN ANTENNA IS A TRANSFORMER IT COUPLES EM WAVES IN THE IMPEDANCE OF FREE SPACE TO SOME OTHER IMPEDANCE

TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE ARE RARELY CLOSE ENOUGH TOGETHER THAT YOU CARE ABOUT THEIR MUTUAL INTERACTION THE TRANSMITTER GENERATES WAVES INTO FREE SPACE THE RECEIVER SEES WAVES TRAVELING IN FREE SPACE AND DOESN'T CARE WHAT PIECE OF METAL GENERATED THEM
I WOULD LOOK AT IT IN TERMS OF KINETIC ENERGY LOSS DUE TO DRAG WHERE THE KINETIC ENERGY LOSS IS THE DRAG FORCE TIMES THE DISTANCE

IF CALCULUS AND INTEGRALS ARE NOT YOUR FORTE
THIS COULD BE APPROXIMATED NUMERICALLY OVER MILES FAIRLY READILY BY ASSUMING MILE SEGMENTS RECALCULATING THE DRAG FORCE IN EACH SEGMENT BASED ON THE VELOCITY AFTER THE KINETIC ENERGY LOSSES OF THE PRIOR SEGMENTS

THERE ARE DOZENS OF LECTURES ONLINE AVAILABLE FOR FREE JUST DO A SEARCH FOR PHYSICS LECTURES ALL OF SERIES IS OUT THERE AS WELL AS DOZENS OF FULL COLLEGE COURSES FOR FREE
IT'S NEVER TOO LATE ANYTHING BY RICHARD FENMAN IS FANTASTIC HOWEVER YOU SHOULD CONSIDER COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR PHYSICS AS THERE HAVE BEEN EVEN ASTRONAUTS WHO HAVE GONE THAT ROUTE
BESIDES THOSE FREE LEARNING RESOURCES ALREADY MENTIONED FEYNMAN LECTURES KHAN ACADEMY ETC THERE ARE A WEALTH OF OTHER FREE MATERIALS AVAILABLE ONLINE HERE ARE SOME OF THEM

THE PHYSICS CLASSROOM

VIDEO LECTURES

FOUND THIS IN A POST A WHILE BACK
SHOULD BE PERFECT FOR YOU

I ALSO LIKE MIT OPENCOURSEWARE A LOT
MANY TEXTBOOKS THAT ARE REQUIRED ARE AVAILABLE AS FREE PDF DOWNLOADS
THE FEYNMAN LECTURES ARE FREE AND ONLINE YOU CAN FIND THEM HERE THEY ARE A GREAT READ AND COVER A WIDE VARIETY OF MATERIAL AT A LEVEL THAT IS UNDERSTANDABLE I WOULD RECOMMEND THEM FOR ANYONE THAT IS INTERESTED IN PHYSICS
TAKE A COMMUNITY COLLEGE CLASSICAL NOT TERRIBLY EXPENSIVE AND ONLY MORE AND YOU'LL HAVE AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE
FREEDMAN AND UNIVERSITY PHYSICS IS A GREAT PLACE TO START IT HAS A LOT OF EXERCISES AND COVERS A LARGE AMOUNT OF PHYSICS IN A MANNER THAT MAKES SENSE IT HAS A LOT OF SUMMARIES AND IS GENERALLY EASY TO FOLLOW

I DON'T LIKE BOOKS THEY HAVE TOO MUCH FOCUS ON HIS CLEVER WAY OF THINKING ABOUT THINGS THAT IS REALLY JUST POINTLESS I ABSOLUTELY HATE THE PART ABOUT POTENTIAL ENERGY WHERE HE TALKS ABOUT REVERSIBLE AND IRREVERSIBLE MACHINES IT'S UNNECESSARILY COMPLICATED AND TSH IT SCARED ME OFF WHEN I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT AND SAW MANY OTHER PEOPLE ONLINE WHO ALSO DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT MAYBE IT GETS BETTER FURTHER ON

ANYWAY BOTH WILL REQUIRE A SMALL AMOUNT OF CALCULUS KNOWLEDGE AND CALCULUS INTUITION
LOOK THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD PHYSICS BOOKS VIDEO LECTURES WEBSITES ETC MANY ARE MENTIONED IN THE COMMENTS BUT OF YOU WANT TO GET INTO PHYSICS AS OPPOSED TO LEARNING SOME PHYSICS FOR FUN GO TO COLLEGE
IF YOU'RE A PHYSICS MAJOR COLLEGE WILL EASILY PAY FOR ITSELF THROUGH SCHOLARSHIPS AND LACWORK AT LEAST THAT WAS MY EXPERIENCE
KHAN ACADEMY HAS SOME PRETTY GOOD PHYSICS LESSONS PRETTY SURE IT'S FREE IT WAS DURING MY FIRST YEAR A FEW YEARS BACK AT LEAST
YOU CAN AUDIT COURSES FOR FREE DDX CAN'T REMEMBER THE WEB ADDRESS BUT JUST GOOGLE DDX ONLINE COURSES OR SOMETHING AND IT SHOULD COME UP
HYPERPHYSICS IS A GREAT RESOURCE NOT THE BEST SITE TO LEARN FROM EXCLUSIVELY BUT WHEN YOU NEED HELP PUTTING IDEAS AND FORMULAS IN CONTEXT I FIND IT EXTREMELY HELPFUL
I LIKE THIS SERIES GOOD LUCK

BLOG
PROBABLY BEEN POSTED BUT PBS SPACE TIME IS AN ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT YOUTUBE CHANNEL ABOUT ASTROPHYSICS WHICH GOES QUITE IN DEPTH
GO TO CC AND TRANSFER I'M HERE NOW BE FRUGAL BUT DON'T STRESS ABOUT LOANS AND WORK HARD LOOK AT ENGINEERING AS WELL IT'S EASY TO DO THE PREREQUISITES FOR PHYSICS AND ENGINEERING AT THE SAME TIME AND TRANSFER AS BOTH ENG AND PHYSICS
COLLEGE DOESN'T NEARLY COST AS BAD AS A LIFETIME OF NOT GETTING A GOOD JOB
I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING IN THE SIDEBAR WITH A BRIEF GUIDE TO PHYSICS FOR VARIOUS PEOPLE

EG I WANT TO BECOME A PHYSICIST IM IN HIGH SCHOOL
I JUST WANT TO LEARN PHYSICS IN MY SPARE TIME

IT COULD INCLUDE TEXTBOOK NAMES ETC FOR THE VARIOUS WAYS IN WHICH PEOPLE WANT TO LEARN PHYSICS CAUSE WE GET THESE KINDA QUESTIONS LITERALLY EVERY DAY
REMOVED
GP REF IE DTF CONDITION NEW

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
FOR STUFF KHAN ACADEMY IS GREAT FOR STUFF IS GREAT MIT OPENCOURSEWARE COVERS A BIT OF EVERYTHING IF YOU CAN BE SELF-SUFFICIENT FOR THE COURSES
CRASH COURSE IS ALWAYS FUN


MIT OFFERS THERE COURSE MATERIAL FOR FREE YOU COULD TRY THERE
FOR AN INTRO TO PHYSICS FOR PHYSICISTS CHECK OUT THE SERIES OF TEXT BOOKS MATTER AND INTERACTIONS GRAB THE FIRST EDITIONS FROM AMAZON FOR ABOUT EACH SHIPPING OR FIND THE PDF THEY'RE FANTASTIC

SOME INTRO TO PHYSICS TEXTS SUFFER FROM TRYING TO ALSO TEACH CHEMISTS ENGINEERS AND THE LIKE OR BEING TOO OUT OF REACH THE LATTER CASE IS THE FEYNMAN LECTURES WHICH TO BE HONEST IS A GREAT RESOURCE FOR FOLKS WHO ALREADY KNOW THE MATERIAL BUT WANT TO SEE THE WIZARDRY THAT IS FEYNMAN BUT FOR NEWIES IS A TAD OUT OF CONTROL
CLICH BUT THE FEYNMAN LECTURES ARE GREAT AND AVAILABLE FOR FREE ONLINE
YOU CAN WATCH ALL THE MIT PHYSICS LECTURES ONLINE WOULD BE A GREAT WAY TO LEARN IF YOU BACK YOURSELF

GERARD T HOOF THEORETICAL PHYSICS AS A CHALLENGE
I RECOMMEND TAKING THE KHAN ACADEMY COURSES ON CALCULUS CULTIVAR CALCULUS AND LINEAR ALGEBRA BEFORE OR ALONG SIDE WITH THE PHYSICS RESOURCES MENTIONED I WOULDN'T HAVE UNDERSTOOD MUCH OF LECTURES WITHOUT THEY'RE FREE AND PROVIDE THE MATH BASIS YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND PHYSICS
FOR ABOUT DOLLARS YOU CAN GET AN OLDER EDITION OF A GENERAL PHYSICS TEXT BOOK GET ONE AND READ THROUGH IT AND TAKE NOTES WORK PRACTICE PROBLEMS AND SUPPLEMENT THINGS YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WITH KHAN ACADEMY ALSO MIT HAS GENERAL PHYSICS OPEN COURSEWARE I RECOMMEND KNIGHT PHYSICS FOR THE BOOK
FENMAN IS AMAZING BUT I WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND MATHEMATICS AS A BUSINESS RELATED MAJOR I RESPECT PHYSICIST ALWAYS ASKING WHY AND SOLVING THINGS THAT WE WOULD NEVER EVEN THINK OF SCIENTISTS RESEARCHERS THEY'RE THE ENTREPRENEURS OF STEM
IN ADDITION TO THE FEYNMAN LECTURES AND THE COUNTLESS FREE LECTURES ONLINE HYPERPHYSICS HAS LONG BEEN A PRETTY GOOD CONCEPTUAL RESOURCE FOR UNDERGRADUATE PHYSICS TOPICS LEARN THE BASICS OF ANY FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS SUBJECT WITH SIMPLE AND STRAIGHT FORWARD SEGMENTS
FOUNDED BY BRIAN GREENE IS GREAT START IF YOU ARE INTO GENERAL RELATIVITY AND QUANTUM PHYSICS COURSES ARE VERY WELL ORGANIZED WITH LECTURE VIDEOS AND THEN ASSIGNMENTS
PERSONALLY JUST SOMEBODY WHO LIKES TO LEARN ABOUT I'M NOT TAKING ANY CLASSES HOWEVER THE WELL-KNOWN STEPHEN HAWKINGS DOES HAVE MULTIPLE BOOKS SOME DIRECTED FOR SCHOLARS AND OTHERS TO EXPLAIN HIS AND OTHERS FINDINGS IN A SIMPLE MANNER SO PRETTY MUCH ANYBODY CAN UNDERSTAND
YOUR MATH OP
SO YOU WANT TO LEARN PHYSICS HAS SOME GREAT ADVISE AND SOURCES ON HOW TO GET STARTED AND THE BEST BOOKS TO TEACH YOURSELF
PHYSICS LECTURES ARE ON-LINE AND PRETTY ACCESSIBLE YOU CAN ALSO FIND MORE RIGOROUS LECTURES AND TEXTS LIKE LANDAU AND LIFSHITZ ON-LINE PRETTY EASILY


I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME BY STEPHEN HAWKING IT'S A FAIRLY GOOD OVERVIEW OF MODERN PHYSICS I RECOMMENDED IT TO MY FATHER WHO ALSO HAS A B SOUTH IN PHYSICS AND HE LOVED IT AS WELL
RIGHT SO I REALIZE THE MATHS HERE IS TRULY HORRENDOUS BUT I WANT TO GIVE IT A GO TO SEE IF ANYONE HAS ANY POINTERS

LET'S TAKE A WAVE E E SIN KING X I T

WE KNOW N K I I C

WE ALSO KNOW N IS ONLY A FUNCTION OF HISTORIC E VALUES IS IT FAIR TO ASSUME

N G T E T DT WITH SOMETHING LIKE A FUNCTION

PLUGGING IN OUR TRIAL WAVE WE HAVE

N G T E SIN KING X I T DT

DISPERSION RELATIONS DEPEND ON FREQUENCY NOT INTENSITY SO THERE MUST BE A WAY TO ARGUE THAT E SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE REASONING I KNOW

N G T SIN KING X I T

EQUATING WE HAVE K I I C G T SIN K I X I T DT

WHICH CAN THEN BE SOLVED FOR G


A GOOD UNDERSTANDING EH THAT'S BOLD THIS BOOK MAY BE NEAR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR NOT QUITE TEXTBOOK BUT NOT EXACTLY POPSCI EITHER
I THINK YOU'D ENJOY READING AN EXCELLENT ART SURVEY SERIES ON CONTEMPORARY PARTICLE PHYSICS WRITTEN BY THEORETICAL PHYSICIST MATTHEW BUCKLEY PROFESSOR AT RUTGERS U

SINCE YOU DIDN'T MENTION KNOWING ABOUT QUANTUM FIELD THEORY I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE SECOND PIECE IN THE SERIES ON AFT THE HITCHHIKER S GUIDE TO QUANTUM FIELD THEORY BUT REALLY SINCE YOU EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN PARTICLE PHYSICS THE WHOLE SERIES IS WORTH READING
MY THOUGHTS ARE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO BE AWARE THAT AT PRESENT THERE ARE SEVERAL LEVELS OF CERTAINTY THAT CAN BE ATTACHED TO DIFFERENT PERIODS IN THE UNIVERSE'S EVOLUTION WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE BASED ON ESTABLISHED PHYSICS AND EXPERIMENTAL FINDINGS COSMOLOGISTS HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE EVOLVING UNIVERSE FROM APPROXIMATELY SECOND AFTER THE BIG BANG TO THE PRESENT BILLION YEARS LATER BASED ON PARTICLE PHYSICS SCIENTISTS CAN EXTRAPOLATE A BIT EARLIER WITH IDEAS THAT CAN'T BE DIRECTLY CONFIRMED YET THEORETICAL PHYSICIST MATT STRASSLER HAS WRITTEN A VERY INTERESTING ARTICLE WHICH PARTS OF THE BIG BANG THEORY ARE RELIABLE AND WHY HE PRESENTS PERIODS WITH DIFFERENT LEVELS OF RELIABILITY IT'S AN EASY READ WHICH I THINK YOU MIGHT ENJOY

BUT WHAT CAUSED THE BIG BANG IS NOT CURRENTLY KNOWN WITH ANY CERTAINTY MULTIPLE SPECULATIVE IDEAS ABOUND SUCH AS THE UNIVERSE EMERGED FROM NOTHINGNESS OR 2 A CYCLIC BOUNCE FROM A CONTRACTING UNIVERSE OR A BACKGROUND SPACETIME OR AN ETERNALLY INFLATING MULTIVERSE ETC ETC ALSO THE IDEA OF AN INITIAL SINGULARITY IS SPECULATIVE IT IS BASED ON THE EQUATIONS OF EINSTEIN S GENERAL RELATIVITY WHICH IS A CLASSICAL THEORY THAT DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR QUANTUM GRAVITY EFFECTS THERE ARE CYCLIC BOUNCE THEORIES FOR EXAMPLE FROM WORK IN LOOP QUANTUM COSMOLOGY PROPOSING THAT THE BOUNCE AVOIDS THE SINGULARITY

THE SAME MULTIPLE VARIETIES OF SPECULATIVE WORK EXIST REGARDING THE NATURE AND CONCEPTS OF TIME

HERE'S AN EXAMPLE TO INDICATE HOW MUCH DIVERSITY THERE IS IN LEADING EDGE THEORETICAL RESEARCH ON THE ORIGINS AND VERY EARLY HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE AS WELL AS ON THE NATURE OF TIME TWENTY OR MORE SCIENTISTS WILL MEET FOR A OR DAY CONFERENCE AND EACH PRESENT TALKS AND PAPERS ON THEIR LATEST THEORETICAL WORK MUCH OF WHICH DIFFERS FROM EACH OTHER SO JUST BE AWARE THAT THE PHYSICS OF THE UNIVERSE FROM ABOUT SECOND AFTER THE BIG BANG IS WELL ESTABLISHED BUT BECOMES MORE AND MORE SPECULATIVE AT TIMES CLOSER TO THE BEGINNING POINT AND ALSO THE NATURE OF TIME HAS A SIMILAR VERY DIVERSE MULTITUDE OF IDEAS THAT SCIENTISTS AND PHILOSOPHERS OF SCIENCE ARE WORKING ON

MY THOUGHTS ARE THAT YOUR TEACHER DID A VERY POOR JOB OF TEACHING YOU ANY OF THE MULTITUDE OF PHYSICS THAT WE ACTUALLY KNOW ABOUT THE BIG BANG INSTEAD HE BURIED YOU IN PLATITUDES AND ASSERTIONS WITHOUT EXPLAINING ANY EVIDENCE FOR HOW WE DESCRIBE THE BIG BANG SORRY RANT OVER
FIRST YEAR OF GRAD SCHOOL SO I'M TRYING TO BALANCE COURSEWORK WITH RESEARCH OBLIGATIONS IN UNDERGRAD I WAS USED TO BANGING OUT WEEKLY HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS BY MYSELF IN ONE SITTING NOW PROBLEM SETS TAKE MUCH LONGER AND I OFTEN HAVE TO COLLABORATE WITH OTHERS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST ADJUSTMENT FOR ME

IN TERMS OF RESEARCH I'M WORKING ON BUILDING A PROTON DETECTOR TO MEASURE BRANCHING RATIOS OF PROTON EMISSIONS IN AN EFFORT TO CONSTRAIN THERMONUCLEAR REACTION RATES RELEVANT TO ASTROPHYSICAL PROCESSES LIKE X-RAY BURSTS AND CLASSICAL NOVAE

IN THE MICROWAVE PART OF THE SPECTRUM A PLASTIC BOX IS MORE LIKELY TO REFRACT THAN ABSORB AND THAT WOULD BE MORE LIKELY IF THE BOX WERE A SOLID CUBE AH IN YOUR TITLE YOU SAY BOX BUT IN YOUR TEXT YOU SAY BIN SO THERE'S SOME ROOM FOR CONFUSION MAYBE YOU SHOULD PROVIDE A WAVELENGTH OF INTEREST AND THE INTENDED APPLICATION

ARE YOU USING THE CHARCOAL AT THE BOTTOM TO VAPORIZE IN THE HEATING PROCESS TO FILL THE CHAMBER WITH I'M ASSUMING I ASSUME THIS IS TO MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF O2 IN THE CHAMBER THOUGH I DON'T KNOW WHY WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN THAT PART A BIT MORE
WHAT'S THE RISK IN EXCEEDING THE AMOUNT OF CHARCOAL REQUIRED RISK OF FAILING TO KEEP OXYGEN CONCENTRATION BELOW A CERTAIN LEVEL IF YOU NEED FINE CONTROL OVER THE COMPOSITION OF THE ATMOSPHERE AND PRESSURE INSIDE I WOULD PUT AN ANALYZER ON THE EXHAUST AND PIPE IN YOUR OWN MODIFIED ATMOSPHERE GETTING IT JUST RIGHT WITH A CHARGE OF CHARCOAL IS PROBABLY A LOT MORE DIFFICULT AND COULD REQUIRE MODULATING TEMPERATURE

ULTIMATELY YOUR QUESTION CAN BE ANSWERED BY THE FACT THAT FIELDS TRANSFORM USUALLY AS IRREDUCIBLE REPRESENTATIONS OF THE LIE ALGEBRA OF THE UNDERLYING SYMMETRY GROUP THE ELECTRON FIELD HAPPENS TO HAVE SPIN I EAST THE INTERNAL SPIN OF PARTICLES IS MEASURED TO BE IN UNITS OF BAR SO THEREFORE IT TRANSFORMS AS THE SPIN 2 REPRESENTATION OF SO
ON THE THEME OF SPIN STRUCTURES AND SPINOR BUNDLES I MENTIONED IN THE OTHER COMMENT TRY THIS BOOK

AS TO WHY ULTIMATELY THE SM FERMIONS ARE FERMIONS AND SO SPINORS BY THERE IS NO EXPLANATION AT THE LEVEL OF THE SM ITSELF THEY COULD HAVE BEEN BOSONS UNLIKE SAY THE PHOTON OR THE W OR THE HIGGS WHICH MUST BE BOSONS IT'S JUST THIS WAY BECAUSE IT IS THERE ARE VARIOUS IRRUPTS OF THE POINCAR GROUP AND NATURE LIKES TO USE MOST OF THEM
YOU ARE MISTAKEN THE CENTER OF MASS DOES NOT CHANGE AS THE BOTTLE WILL MOVE IN RESPONSE JUST TRY IT OUT

IN CLASSICAL MECHANICS YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND A REFERENCE FRAME WHERE THE CENTER OF MASS IS STATIONARY IF THERE ARE NO EXTERNAL FORCES ACTING ON THE OBJECT

THIS IS ACTUALLY OFTEN DONE TO SIMPLIFY CALCULATIONS FOR EXAMPLE IN YOUR CASE

CONSIDER A WATER BOTTLE AT REST IN SPACE YOU SPIN IT AROUND ITS INITIAL CENTER OF MASS AND WANT TO DESCRIBE THE AVERAGE MOTION OF THE SYSTEM IN SOME WAY

NOW THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF LOOKING AT THIS
YOU COULD GLUE YOURSELF TO THE INSIDE OF THE BOTTLE THE WATER WILL THEN NEARLY CHAOTICALLY MOVE AROUND AND YOU'D BE SCRATCHING YOUR HEAD IF THERE IS ANYTHING REASONABLY GOING ON AT ALL

THE OTHER WAY IS LOOKING AT THE BOTTLE FROM OUTSIDE YOU'D SEE IT SPINNING AROUND ITS CENTER OF MASS AND WHILE WATER AND BOTTLE WOULD BOTH MOVE ABOUT CHAOTICALLY IT'D IN AVERAGE JUST SPIN STATIONARILY
YOU CAN ONLY USE THE TRICK OF CHOOSING A DIFFERENT AXIS WHEN THE OBJECTS ARE IT STATIC EQUILIBRIUM IF IT'S ROTATING IT HAS A DEFINITE AXIS OF ROTATION IF THE OBJECT IS FREE FROM EXTERNAL FORCES THE AXIS OF ROTATION MUST PASS THROUGH THE CENTER OF MASSACHUSETTS

FOR THE WATER BOTTLE SCENARIO I WOULD APPROACH IT AS A STATIONARY CENTER OF MASS WITH A VARYING INERTIA TENSOR THIS ALL GETS QUITE MATHEMATICALLY COMPLICATED QUICKLY SEE THE EULER ROTATION EQUATIONS FOR MORE BUT NOTE THAT THEY ONLY APPLY TO RIGID BODIES IF YOU HAVE A DEFORMING OBJECT THEN THERE ARE EVEN MORE COMPLICATED TERMS FOR INCLUDING DI DT
I READ SOMEWHERE THAT TIME COULD BE SEEN AS AN EMERGENT PHENOMENA OF CAUSALITY WOULD THAT GO IN LINE WITH WHAT IS WRITTEN IN THE ARTICLE

TO CONTINUE WITH THE EXAMPLE FROM SPECIAL RELATIVITY I SUPPOSE TWO EVENTS CAN BE EXPERIENCED IN DIFFERENT ORDER FOR TWO OBSERVERS BUT CAUSALITY CAN ONLY GO ONE WAY AND SHOULD NOT LOOK DIFFERENT FOR THE TWO OBSERVERS THAT MEANS THAT EVENTS THAT HAVE A CAUSAL DEPENDENCY SHOULD ALWAYS BE SEEN IN THE SAME ORDER FOR ALL OBSERVERS

FROM MY AMATEUR POINT OF VIEW IT LOOKS LIKE TIME IS SOMETHING ILLUSIVE BUT CAUSALITY ISN'T
IN OUR CURRENT THEORIES TIME IS CONTINUOUS SO THE ANSWER IS NUMBER

HOWEVER THERE'S A GOOD POINT IN YOUR QUESTION SOMETIMES POP SCIENCE LIKES TO SIMPLIFY PHYSICS SO THAT THINGS LOOK DISCRETE FOR EXAMPLE THEY TALK ABOUT AN ELECTRON JUMPING BETWEEN ENERGY STATES AS YOU SAY AND IT GIVES THE IMPRESSION THAT THIS HAPPENS INSTANTANEOUSLY ACTUALLY THE EVOLUTION OF THE ELECTRON WAVEFUNCTION IS PERFECTLY CONTINUOUS AND IT ALWAYS TRANSITIONS BETWEEN TWO STATES VIA INTERMEDIATE SUPERPOSITIONS
ADDICTEDREDDIT IS WRONG PLANK TIME HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SMALLEST MEASURABLE TIME INTERVAL PLANK SCALES ARE SIMPLY SCALES AT WHICH CURRENT THEORIES WOULD BREAK DOWN THERE IS NOTHING TO SUGGEST THEY ARE THE SMALLEST MEASURABLE SCALES
DELETED
THE PROCESS CREATES THE TIME OR THE SPACETIME ANYTHING WITH MASS GIVES RISE TO SPACETIME WE KNOW THIS FROM RELATIVITY ON OR NEAR A BLACK HOLE THE LENGTH OF TIME IS LONGER AND FURTHER YOU ARE AWAY FROM MASS THE SHORTER THE LENGTH OF TIME ITS RELATIVE

SO NO TWO TIMES OR LENGTH OF PASSAGE OF TIMES ARE THE SAME BUT MANY ARE CLOSE WE REFER TO THAT AS A FRAME OF REFERENCE

WITH SPACETIME IT IS THE SAME AS THE LENGTH OF SPACE THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT IS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO POINTS REQUIRES TWO POINTS MATTER GIVES RISE TO SPACETIME AND WITHOUT A PROCESS OR MATTER TIME AND SPACE WOULD HAVE A LENGTH OF ZERO

YOU COULD ALSO CONSIDER AN ELECTRON IN A QUANTUM LEAP FROM ONE STATE TO ANOTHER IT IS IN ONE STATE THEN IT IS IN THE OTHER STATE IT IS NOT ANYWHERE IN BETWEEN THE STATES WHAT SEEMS TO HAPPEN IN THAT PROCESS IS THAT THE SPACE AND TIME FOR THAT LEAP IS ENCAPSULATED INTO A PHOTON
ASTRONOMER HERE I AM PLEASED TO SAY THIS IS MY FIRST AND HOPEFULLY NOT LAST PIECE FOR SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN I MEAN ONLY A GUEST BLOG POST BUT WHO TURNS THAT DOWN

ANYWAY ALWAYS THOUGHT SONOLUMINESENCE SHOULD BE DISCUSSED MORE BECAUSE IT'S DAMN COOL HOPE SOME OTHERS AGREE
SURELY WE HAVE FAST ENOUGH SPECTROMETERS NOW TO FIGURE THIS OUT IF THE TEMPERATURE IS SO HIGH HOWEVER DEFINED IN THIS SYSTEM WHY IS IT NOT JUST RELATED TO BLACKBODY RADIATION
THIS WAS VERY INTERESTING C WITH JUST A BUBBLE

I CANT EVEN THINK OF A REASON FOR IT WHEW
I REMEMBER TWENTY YEARS OR SO AGO SOME DUDE WAS PUBLISHING THAT HE HAD SEEN EVIDENCE OF FUSION DURING BUT THEN DIDN'T IT TURN OUT HE'D BEEN MISREPRESENTING HIS RESULTS

I TAKE IT FUSION IS PRETTY MUCH RULED OUT AS AN EXPLANATION
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME EXPERIMENTS WITH BREWING BEER USING CAVITATION

FASCINATING STUFF
ACTUALLY ISN'T IT DAMN HOT YOU MEAN
R ASKPHYSICS IS PRACTICALLY WORTHLESS

LOOKS TO ME LIKE R ASKPHYSICS IS BUSY THRIVING AND HELPING OUT ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO POST A QUESTION WHAT'S THE PROBLEM HOW IS IT PRACTICALLY WORTHLESS
THIS IS AN INSIGHTFUL QUESTION

YES JUST LIKE IN AN IDEAL GAS PRESSURE HELPED EXPAND THE UNIVERSE IT WAS MAINLY DUE TO TONS OF PHOTONS RATHER THAN JUST GAS BUT THE PRINCIPLE IS SIMILAR THIS PRESSURE CONTRIBUTED MOSTLY IN THE EARLY UNIVERSE BACK WHEN THE UNIVERSE WAS VERY DENSE

WHEN THE UNIVERSE GOT SPACIOUS ENOUGH THE PRESSURE GOT LOW AND DIDN'T MATTER SO MUCH COMPARED TO OTHER FORCES LIKE GRAVITY WHICH SLOWED DOWN THE EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE LOGICALLY WE EXPECTED THE GRAVITY TO PULL THE UNIVERSE BACK TOGETHER IN SORT OF A BIG CRUNCH BUT WHEN WE ACTUALLY LOOKED WITH THE HUBBLE TELESCOPE WE FOUND THAT THERE'S SOME OTHER MYSTERIOUS FORCE THAT GETS STRONGER IN A LARGER TOTAL VOLUME RATHER THAN WEAKER LIKE WITH PRESSURE OR GRAVITY THIS FORCE IS THE ONE WE CALL DARK ENERGY MYSTERIOUS BECAUSE IT'S PUFFING UP THE UNIVERSE MORE AND MORE AS IT GETS BIGGER RATHER THAN LESS AND LESS AS YOU'D EXPECT FROM PRESSURE

SO YES YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT BUT THAT ISN'T OUR CULPRIT WE'VE STILL GOT A MYSTERY ON OUR HANDS HERE
ON HIS PREVIOUS TRIP TO HESSE FRANKLAND HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH A GERMAN WOMAN NAMED SOPHIE FICK

I'M AND I STILL HAD TO CHUCKLE LIKE A SCHOOLBOY HERE

ON A SERIOUS NOTE I WONDER WHAT THE CURRICULUM BACK THEN LOOKED LIKE NO MAXWELL EQUATIONS AT LEAST NOT COMPLETE SPECIAL OR GENERAL RELATIVITY QUANTUM MECHANICS
BRILLIANT
CHECK OUT THE BIG HEAD ON FRANKLAND
SCIENTISTS STUDENTS AND FACULTY FROM THE ABLATOR TEAM WILL DISCUSS FUSION THE PRESSURE RECORD ABLATOR AND THE APPROACH AT AN ASK ME ANYTHING SESSION ON REDDIN ON THURSDAY OCTOBER AT PAGE MASCULINE EDT

IT LOOKS LIKE OUR QUESTIONS WILL BE ANSWERED SOON
HOW MUCH PRESSURE IS NEEDED
I MAINLY READ

WAS HEATED WITH OVER MILLION WATTS OF POWER

MW IS QUITE A LOT IS THIS EVEN CLOSE TO BREAK EVEN LET ALONE SELF SUSTAINABILITY
THIS IS AMAZING


IF WE COULD BUILD LARGER EXPERIMENTAL REACTORS THEN IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER TO MAKE IT A SUSTAINABLE CHOICE

I JUST WISH THAT THERE WAS MORE FUNDING FOR NUCLEAR FUSION SO WE WOULD SPEED UP AND SWITCH TO NUCLEAR FUSION SOLVING MANY OF OUR ENERGY RELATED PROBLEMS


BUT I GUESS MONEY WILL CONTINUE TO GO TO FOOTBALLER RATHER THAN SCIENTISTS CHANGING THE POSSIBLE PROGRESSION OF THE HUMAN RACE
IF YOU'RE HERE TO LEARN ABOUT FUSION THE BEST DISCUSSION IS BURIED UNDER U COMMENT WHICH WAS BECAUSE PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE HIS TONE

R PHYSICS COMMENTS RDWXQ
TWO ATMOSPHERES SERIOUSLY TWO ATMOSPHERES THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS SHIT FOR LIKE DECADES NOW AND THEY CAN'T PRODUCE MORE THAN TWO ATMOSPHERES OF PRESSURE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT I'M FAIRLY SURE THE PRESSURE AT THE CORE OF THE SUN IS HIGHER THAN TWO ATMOSPHERES

YOU CAN DOWNVOTE ME IF YOU WANT BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO MAKE SELF-SUSTAINING FUSION REACTIONS POSSIBLE AT TWO ATMOSPHERES OF PRESSURE

ETA THE MORE I READ THE WORSE IT GETS

THE AMOUNT OF POWER PRODUCED INCREASES WITH THE SQUARE OF THE PRESSURE SO DOUBLING THE PRESSURE LEADS TO A FOURFOLD INCREASE IN ENERGY PRODUCTION



THE PLASMA PRODUCED TRILLION FUSION REACTIONS PER SECOND

TRILLION FUSION REACTIONS PER SECOND PRODUCES ABOUT AS MUCH POWER AS THREE GUYS ON BICYCLE GENERATORS THEY ADMIT RIGHT THERE IN THE ARTICLE THAT THEY WOULD NEED AT LEAST A OR ORDER OF MAGNITUDE INCREASE IN PRESSURE TO MAKE THIS CONCEPT VIABLE FOR POWER GENERATION AND THE VERY BEST THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE IN OVER A DECADE IS FIFTEEN PERCENT HOW CAN ANYONE THINK THIS IS EVEN A REMOTELY PRACTICAL APPROACH TO FUSION POWER

YES THERE ARE MANY SUCH SPECIAL FUNCTIONS MANY ARE SOLUTIONS TO SOME DIFFERENTIAL DIFFERENCE OR FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS THAT CANNOT BE EXPRESSED IN TERMS OF THE ELEMENTARY FUNCTIONS EXAMPLES INCLUDE THE GAMMA FUNCTION AND ITS PROGENY DIGAMMA BETA ETC THE MANY BESSEL FUNCTIONS SPHEROIDAL CYLINDRICAL FUNCTIONS ELLIPTIC FUNCTIONS INTEGRALS FRESNEL FUNCTIONS ETC

YOU CAN FIND INFORMATION ABOUT MANY OF THESE INCLUDING THEIR PROPERTIES AND INTEGRAL REPRESENTATION AT WOLFRAM FUNCTIONS COMPUTER ALGEBRA SYSTEMS LIKE MATHEMATIC AND MAPLE KNOW ALL ABOUT THESE SPECIAL FUNCTIONS THOUGH OFTEN NOT EVERYTHING A STANDARD AND COMPREHENSIVE REFERENCE FOR SUCH INTEGRALS IS GRADSHTEYN AND RYZHIK
THERE ARE SOMETIMES TRICKS USING GENERATING FUNCTIONS LET'S SAY YOU WANT TO SOLVE AN INTEGRAL OF THE FORM

F N X N F X DX

AND YOU KNOW THE ANALYTIC SOLUTION TO THE INTEGRAL

Z J E J X F X DX

THEN

F N D N Z J DJ N

WHERE MY NOTATION INTENDS TO TELL YOU TO SET J AFTER TAKING N DERIVATIVES WITH RESPECT TO J THE DERIVATIVES MAY BE TEDIOUS BUT THEY'RE USUALLY LESS TEDIOUS THAN THE INTEGRALS
THERE'S THE ERROR FUNCTION
I AM JUST A LOWLY ENGINEER WHO IS SEVERAL YEARS OUT OF HIS ADVANCED MATH CLASS AND ALL I HAVE TO SAY TO YOUR INTEGRAL IS BLESS YOUR SOUL
ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS ARE PRETTY COOL VERY USEFUL IN MECHANICS

POLYLOGARITHMS ARE ALSO UBIQUITOUS IN STATMECH IN PARTICULAR FOR ORDER BUT THEY DON'T CALL THEM WITH THEIR NAME SO YOU DON'T REALIZE

SEE THE BACK OF GRIFFITHS QUANTUM BOOK LOTS OF GOOD FUNCTIONS THERE
SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED A CRC
SOMEWHAT RELATED IS THAT YOU CAN USE MONTE CARLO SIMULATION TO ESTIMATE A DEFINITE INTEGRAL JUST GENERATE A BUNCH OF POINTS CALCULATE VALUES AND INTERPOLATE THE MORE POINTS YOU GENERATE THE MORE ACCURATE AND PRECISE YOUR ESTIMATE
THIS IS GETTING EMBARRASSING AT WHAT POINT DOES COSMOLOGY ADMIT THEY GOT IT WRONG AND START TO DIRECT EFFORTS INTO FINDING WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON
IS THIS SOMETHING GRADUATE SCHOOLS FROWN UPON

I'M NO EXPERT ON GRADUATE ADMISSIONS AND I TOOK FIVE AND A HALF YEARS TO GRADUATE BUT I DON'T THINK THEY CARE IN THE SLIGHTEST I'M IN A GRADUATE PROGRAM NOW NOT A TERRIBLY ONE HOWEVER SO THIS MAY CHANGE DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU WANT AND PROGRAMS REGULARLY TAKE STUDENTS WHO DID NOT GRADUATE IN CONVENTIONAL WAYS

PERSONALLY I'D LOOK ON A STUDENT MUCH MORE FAVORABLY WHO TOOK A DOUBLE MAJOR AND DID WELL ACADEMICALLY THAN ONE WHO GRADUATED ONE SEMESTER EARLIER AND DIDN'T TAKE AN EXTRA MAJOR ASSUMING IT'S RELEVANT TO WHAT THEY WANT TO STUDY OR WHO LET THEIR GRADES SLIP BECAUSE THEY OVERLOADED THEMSELVES MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE WILL YELL AT ME THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT BUT I CAN'T SEE AN EXTRA SEMESTER OR YEAR MATTERING MUCH

IT MAY HOWEVER CAUSE ISSUES WITH GETTING FUNDING FOR THAT FIRST SEMESTER OF GRAD SCHOOL IF YOU START IN AN OFF-SEASON TALK TO SPECIFIC PROGRAMS ABOUT THAT
STARTING IN THE OFF SEMESTER CAN BE COMPLICATED OTHER THAN THAT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER IF YOU TAKE A LITTLE EXTRA TIME IF YOU TAKE YEARS THAT MIGHT GET FUNNY LOOKS BUT ISN'T UNUSUAL
WHAT COUNTRY DO YOU LIVE IN WHAT AREA DO YOU PLAN ON SPECIALIZING IN

I'VE ALWAYS BEEN TOLD THE QUALITY OF YOUR WORK IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TO GRAD SCHOOLS THAN SPEED THEY DON'T EVEN LOOK AT YOUR GRADUATION DATE
I DON'T REALLY THINK THEY CARE MAYBE YEARS WOULD BE ODD BUT YEARS REALLY ISN'T THAT UNUSUAL
YES
THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT PHENOMENA AT WORK HERE A BLACKBODY DOESN'T GO FROM RED TO BLUE IT GOES FROM RED TO YELLOW TO WHITE AND STAYS THERE THE REASON IS THAT AS IT HEATS UP YOU DON'T GET LESS OF THE LOWER WAVELENGTHS I EAST RED YOU JUST GET MORE OF THE HIGHER WAVELENGTHS I EAST BLUE EVENTUALLY YOU HAVE A LOT OF ENERGY ALL OVER THE SPECTRUM AND THAT LOOKS WHITE

WHAT U DERIODERIO POSTED ARE THE EMISSION LINES FOR VARIOUS ELEMENTS THIS IS RELEVANT PRECISELY WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS NOT A PERFECT BLACKBODY CERTAIN ATOMS OR MOLECULES HAVE DEFINED WAVELENGTHS AT WHICH THEY EMIT LIGHT AND THIS IS WHAT GIVES COLOR TO BLUE OR GREEN FIRE FOR EXAMPLE
THERE ARE THEORIES THAT PREDICT THE COLORS EMITTED WHEN STUFF BURNS HOW TRICKY THOSE THEORIES ARE DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU START WITH I DON'T THINK ACTUALLY STARTED WITH THE STANDARD MODEL AND WORKED ALL THE WAY UP TO COPPER BURNS GREEN IN STEPS BUT IT'S BELIEVED TO BE POSSIBLE IN PRINCIPLE

THERE ARE ALSO TABLES AND CHARTS

A NICE ARTICLE BUT THE AUTHOR COULD HAVE CHECKED IT A BIT MORE CAREFULLY

THE DETECTOR S ATOMIC CLOCKS CAN DETECT THE DIFFERENCE THAT IT TAKES FOR LASER BEAMS TO TRAVEL DOWN ONE ARM VERSUS THE OTHER

THIS IS NOT HOW FIGO WORKS THIS IS NOT HOW ANY OF THIS WORKS

IN JUNE FIGO DETECTED GRAVITATIONAL WAVES A SECOND TIME FROM AN EVENT NAMED

IN JUNE EXACTLY AS THE NAMING SCHEME SUGGESTS FOR AND BECAUSE JUNE IS THE MONTH IN THE YEAR
THE MEMORY EFFECT WILL LOOK LIKE AN ADDITIONAL FLARE OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES NEAR THE END OF THE EVENT THAT CAUSED THE MAIN BURST OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES HE ADDS

THAT MAKES IT SOUND LIKE YOU CAN DETECT THIS MEMORY EFFECT AS IT OCCURS NOT AFTERWARDS I'M GUESSING YOU CAN'T DO SOME MEASUREMENTS ON A BIT OF SPACETIME AFTER THE EVENT AND WORK OUT WHETHER OR NOT SOME GRAVITATIONAL WAVES ONCE PASSED THROUGH
OVERALL I DID CONSIDER THIS A GOOD ARTICLE HOWEVER THE USE OF THE PHRASES GRAVITATIONAL WAVE MEMORY AND PERMANENTLY ALTER SPACETIME SEEM LIKE VERY BAD CHOICES OF WORDING TO ME BECAUSE A STRAIGHTFORWARD INTUITIVE INTERPRETATION IMPLIES MORE ABOUT THESE PHENOMENA THAN IS REALLY THERE

FOR EXAMPLE PERMANENTLY ALTER IMPLIES THAT THE ALTERATION CAN'T BE UNDONE BUT IF ANOTHER GRAVITATIONAL WAVE AFFECTS THE SAME SYSTEM LATER IN THE OPPOSITE WAY TWO OBJECTS THAT HAVE THEIR DISTANCE SHRUNK CAN THEN HAVE IT STRETCHED BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL DISTANCE OR MORE SO THE INITIAL EFFECT MAY BE LASTING BUT IT IS NOT PERMANENT

SIMILARLY MEMORY IMPLIES THAT INFORMATION ABOUT AN EVENT CAN BE RELIABLY RECALLED BUT IF A LATER EVENT UNDOES THE ORIGINAL CHANGE THERE IS NO WAY TO RECALL THAT EITHER EVENT HAPPENED BY LOOKING ONLY AT INSTANTANEOUS PROPERTIES OF THE SYSTEM EXCEPT BY RECORDING THEM WITH AN EXTERNAL RECORD BUT THEN IT IS THE EXTERNAL RECORD THAT HAS THE MEMORY NOT SPACETIME OR THE SYSTEM ITSELF NOR EVEN THAT EITHER EVENT EVER HAPPENED IF THERE WAS A REAL MEMORY BOTH EVENTS COULD BE RECALLED EVEN IF THEY CANCELLED EACH OTHER OUT SO THERE REALLY IS NO MEMORY AT ALL THERE IS JUST DYNAMIC STRUCTURE BUT THEN WE ALREADY KNEW THAT ABOUT SPACETIME

I REALLY DETEST WHEN RESEARCHERS OR JOURNALISTS SUGGEST THINGS HAVE A MEMORY JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE A DYNAMIC STRUCTURE THAT CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO PHENOMENA BY THAT DEFINITION LITERALLY EVERY OBJECT IN THE UNIVERSE HAS A MEMORY BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN HOMEOPATHY ACTUALLY WORKS REFL
CONVERSELY PBS SPACE TIME DID A WONDERFUL PIECE ON YOUTUBE TODAY TITLED BLACK HOLES FROM THE DAWN OF TIME

PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES MAY BE LURKING THROUGHOUT OUR UNIVERSE HOW LARGE ARE THEY HOW MANY ARE OUT THERE AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THEY MOVED THROUGH OUR SOLAR SYSTEM

MY BRAIN COMPLETELY MELTED AT THE PART WHERE A BLACK HOLE HAS AN EVENT HORIZON THE SIZE OF A PROTON AND IF THAT DIDN'T EXACERBATE MY ANXIETY ENOUGH THERE'S PROBABLY A LITANY OF THESE GUYS PASSING THROUGH THE EARTH EVERYDAY LIKE IT'S AIR WHILE AT THE SAME TIME EXPELLING A BILLION JOULES OF HAWKING RADIATION
SPACETIME RETURNS TO ITS INITIAL STATE IT DOESN'T OSCILLATE AT AN INCREASINGLY LOWER AMPLITUDE INDEFINITELY
LAYMAN HERE IS IT FAIR TO ASSUME THAT EVEN IF THE SUPPOSITION IS TRUE THAT THE EFFECTS WOULD BE TOO SMALL TO ACCOUNT FOR THE ACCELERATION OF THE EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE
ACTUALLY MUCH LARGER GRAVITATION WAVES WITH MEMORY WERE PREDICTED MATHEMATICALLY BY D CHRISTODOULOU IN IN HIS ON THE FORMATION OF BLACK HOLES
CAN'T UNVOTE THIS ENOUGH GREAT ARTICLE
GOOD READ
WHAT IF EACH COLLISION OF EVERYTHING ADS SPACE AND THAT WHY IT'S EXPANDING

IT SEEMED LIKE BLACK HOLES COULD BE JUST THE AFTER EFFECT OF THE COLLISION SUCH WHEN LIGHTNING STRIKES AND THE AIR FILLS THE RESULTING VACUUM

THE GRAVITATIONAL WAVE IS LIKE THE SOUND WAVE EMITTED AS A RESULT

THIS IS INTERESTING TO THINK ABOUT BECAUSE IT WOULD DEPEND SPACE TO TRAVEL JUST AS SOUND REQUIRES DENSER MORE SOLID MATTER
HERE YOU SHOULD FIND EVERTING YOU NEED
I USE NUMERICAL METHODS MUCH MORE OFTEN THAN EQUATIONS BUT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TREATMENT OF THAT IN MY UNDERGRAD CLASSES I WISH THERE HAD BEEN HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS LIKE WRITE A PROGRAM TO CALCULATE THE ELECTRIC FIELD AROUND
I REALLY WISH THAT I HAD BEEN TAUGHT WHAT A FUNCTION IS

I WISH I HAD HAD A PROPER TREATMENT OF ERROR ANALYSIS AS AN UNDERGRAD I DIDN'T GET ONE UNTIL GRAD SCHOOL

I STILL DON'T KNOW VERY MUCH OPTICS IN A SORT OF BACKWARDS WAY I KNOW MORE ABOUT BEAM OPTICS IN THE CONTEXT OF ACCELERATORS MORE THAN I KNOW ABOUT SIMPLE OPTICS OF LIGHT

THINGS LIKE COMPLEX ANALYSIS PDES AND FUNCTIONS WHICH I'VE NEVER HAD A RIGOROUS COURSE ON BUT HAVE MANAGED TO PICK UP WHAT I NEED FROM OTHER COURSES
I WISH MY EDUCATION IN PHYSICS HAD BEEN MORE MATHEMATICALLY RIGOROUS
I WISH SOMEONE WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME A EXPLANATION FOR WHAT A PATH INTEGRAL IS EVEN REGARDED BOOKS LIKE MASAO AND PRETEND YOU CAN TAKE LIMITS THAT YOU JUST CAN'T
I WISH WE WERE TAUGHT MORE ABOUT HIGH-FREQUENCY ELECTROMAGNETISM I REMEMBER DOING FRAGMENTS WHEN WE LEARNT CIRCUITS BUT NOTHING BEYOND THAT'S

NOW I'M WORKING WITH RF WAVEGUIDES AND HIGH FREQUENCY IS ALL I DO
I WISH WE'D BEEN GIVEN A PROPER INTRODUCTION TO PHASE SPACE AND WHAT A SIGNIFICANT CONCEPT IT IS IN PHYSICS IT WAS JUST DROPPED INTO OUR QM CLASS AND AGAIN IN CLASSICAL MECHANICS IN A WAY THAT I FEEL THAT REALLY DOESN'T DO IT JUSTICE
LOOKING BACK I WISH I HAD DONE MORE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS IT'S MY FAULT FOR DOING PURE MATHS
SPECIAL FUNCTIONS IN UNDERGRAD THEY JUST KINDA SPRUNG THINGS LIKE HERMITE POLYNOMIALS AND THE ASSOCIATED MATHEMATICAL TRICKS ON YOU WITH MINIMAL HANDWAVY EXPLANATIONS AND HOPED YOU'D JUST EVENTUALLY FIGURE IT OUT YOURSELF WE COULD HAVE AT LEAST GONE OVER STURMLOUVILLE EQUATIONS IN MATH METHODS YOU KNOW INSTEAD WE LEARNED HOW TO SOLVE A CUBIC EQUATION AND WHY YOU CAN'T SOLVE A QUARTIC OR ABOVE
I ALWAYS HATED THAT NECESSARY MATH WAS TAUGHT CONCURRENTLY WITH PHYSICS THAT NEEDS THAT MATHEMATICS IT WAS ALWAYS A PROBLEM FOR ME I NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE MATH FOR SAKE FIRST THEN USE IT IN PHYSICS STRUGGLING WITH VECTOR CALC FOR EXAMPLE WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY DOING E M WHICH IS VERY VECTOR CALC HEAVY MEANT THAT I REALLY WASN'T ENGAGING E M ON A CONCEPTUAL LEVEL IN FACT I NEVER REALLY LEARNED E M PARTICULARLY WELL UNTIL I HAD TO RE LEARN IT FOR MY COMPS IT WAS SIMILAR WITH CLASSICAL MECHANICS AND ODE AND MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS COMPLEX ANALYSIS AND BASIC FIELD THEORY ETC

I ALSO WISH THAT CONCEPTS WERE PUT BEFORE PROBLEM SOLVING MOST PROBLEMS I SOLVE TODAY I JUST DO NUMERICALLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPTS OF SAY SCATTERING BETTER RATHER THAN SPENDING A HUGE AMOUNT OF TIME DICKING AROUND WITH SPHERICAL HARMONICS AND PARTIAL WAVES
THIS IS JUST A PRESS RELEASE WHERE IS THE ACTUAL LINK
SAW HIS TALK AT MARCH MEETING VERY INTERESTING AND CLEVER STUFF AS ONE MIGHT EXPECT FROM FRENKEL BUT HARDLY AS UNIVERSAL AS THE HEADLINE IMPLIES
ENERGY IS THE THING THAT IS CONSERVED WHEN SYSTEMS DON'T DEPEND ON WHAT TIME IT IS MORE TECHNICALLY IT ARISES FROM THEOREM AND IS THE CONSERVED QUANTITY ASSOCIATED WITH SYMMETRY THIS IS NOT AS ARBITRARY OR AS DEFINITIONS LIKE ENERGY IS THE CAPACITY TO DO WORK AND WORK IS A CHANGE IN ENERGY

ONE MISCONCEPTION THAT PEOPLE OFTEN HAVE IS THE IDEA THAT THINGS ARE ENERGY OR CAN BE MADE OF ENERGY WHEN IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO SAY THEY HAVE ENERGY
TO THE BEST OF MY UNDERSTANDING HERE ARE THREE DEFINITIONS OF ENERGY LISTED IN ORDER OF INCREASING ACCURACY COMPLEXITY SATISFACTION

ENERGY IS THE CAPACITY TO DO WORK
ENERGY IS THE OF THE VECTOR
ENERGY IS THE CONSERVED CURRENT CORRESPONDING TO INVARIANCE OF THE PHYSICAL ACTION OF A SYSTEM UNDER TRANSFORMATIONS

THE FIRST DEFINITION IS THE MOSTLY INTUITIVE LAYMAN DEFINITION ENERGY IS THE CAPACITY TO DO WORK ON OTHER SYSTEMS THIS DEFINITION WHILE INTUITIVE HAS EXCEPTIONS SUCH AS FORMS OF ENERGY THAY CAN'T BE HARNESSED TO DO WORK LIKE DARK ENERGY AND ENERGY AND IS RATHER UNSATISFACTORY BECAUSE IT IS IMMEDIATELY CIRCULAR IT BEGS THE QUESTION WHAT IS WORK AND THEN WORK IS BASICALLY DEFINED AS A TRANSFER OF ENERGY BETWEEN SYSTEMS AND IS MEASURED IN UNITS OF ENERGY BUT FOR THE MAJORITY OF ORDINARY EVERYDAY SYSTEMS THIS DEFINITION IS AT LEAST BROADLY ACCURATE

THE SECOND DEFINITION IS A BIT MORE ABSTRACT BUT STILL AT LEAST MODESTLY INTUITIVE IN CLASSICAL MECHANICS OBJECTS HAVE A PROPERTY MOMENTUM WHICH IS A VECTOR WITH COMPONENTS A ONE FOR EACH DIMENSION OF SPACE IN RELATIVITY HOWEVER SPACE AND TIME ARE UNIFIED INTO A FOUR-DIMENSIONAL CONSTRUCT SPACETIME ACCORDINGLY THERE NEEDS TO BE A FOUR-DIMENSIONAL GENERALIZATION OF ADDING A COMPONENT CORRESPONDING TO THE TIME DIMENSION AND THUS PROMOTING THEM TO A IN THE CASE OF THE MOMENTUM THE TIME COMPONENT HAPPENS TO BE THE ENERGY ALONG WITH A CONVERSION FACTOR TO GET THE UNITS RIGHT WHICH MAY VARY IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS ACCORDING TO WHAT CONVENTIONS ARE USED FOR THE UNITS ACCORDINGLY YOU CAN THINK OF ENERGY BY WAY OF A SIMPLE ANALOGY ENERGY IS TO TIME AS MOMENTUM IS TO SPACE

THE LAST DEFINITION IS VERY TECHNICAL AND MUCH LESS INTUITIVE BUT IT IS ALSO THE MOST GENERAL AND MOST CORRECT DEFINITION IT HAS TO DO WITH THE BEHAVIOR OF SYSTEMS UNDER SYMMETRY TRANSFORMATIONS EMMY NAETHER PUBLISHED AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THEOREM CALLED THEOREM WHICH IN OVERSIMPLIFIED TERMS STATES THAT FOR EVERY CONTINUOUS MORE SPECIFICALLY DIFFERENTIABLE SYMMETRY THAT A SYSTEM EXHIBITS THERE IS A CORRESPONDING CONSERVED QUANTITY THIS EXTREMELY GENERAL THEOREM CAN BE APPLIED NOT ONLY TO ENERGY BUT TO MANY OTHER SYMMETRIES AND CONSERVED QUANTITIES

FOR EXAMPLE ISOLATED SYSTEMS POSSESS SOMETHING CALLED TRANSLATION SYMMETRY WHICH MEANS THAT THEIR BEHAVIOR IS UNCHANGED AFTER THE APPLICATION OF A TRANSLATION TRANSFORMATION WHICH JUST MEANS MOVING IT LINEARLY TO ANOTHER LOCATION IN SPACE IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE THE SYSTEM IS IN SPACE THE BEHAVIOR OF THE SYSTEM REMAINS THE SAME IT IS INVARIANT BY THEOREM THAT MEANS THE SYSTEM HAS A CONSERVED QUANTITY RELATED TO THIS SYMMETRY THAT CONSERVED QUANTITY IS LINEAR MOMENTUM BECAUSE SYSTEMS ARE THEIR MOMENTUM IS CONSERVED BY A SIMILAR TOKEN SYSTEMS ALSO EXHIBIT ROTATIONAL SYMMETRY IF YOU ROTATE A SYSTEM IN SPACE ITS BEHAVIOR ALSO REMAINS UNCHANGED THEREFORE BY THEOREM THE SYSTEM'S ANGULAR MOMENTUM IS CONSERVED

SO I MENTIONED ABOVE THAT IN RELATIVITY TIME IS ALSO TREATED AS A DIMENSION OF DIMENSIONAL SPACETIME AND ACCORDINGLY OBJECTS HAVE A COORDINATE DESCRIBING THEIR LOCATION ALONG THE TIME AXIS SO IT IS POSSIBLE TO TRANSLATE SYSTEMS ALONG THAT AXIS TO A DIFFERENT TIME COORDINATE THIS IS THE TRANSFORMATION AND IF A SYSTEM'S BEHAVIOR IS UNCHANGED AFTER A TIME TRANSLATION I EAST IT BEHAVES THE SAME NO MATTER WHEN THE SYSTEM IS LOCATED THEN IT POSSESSES SYMMETRY BY THEOREM THERE IS A CORRESPONDING CONSERVED QUANTITY AND THAT QUANTITY IS ENERGY

HOPE THAT HELPS

EDIT ALSO IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THESE QUANTITIES CAN BE DEFINED BY THE ASSOCIATED SYMMETRY THAT WHEN POSSESSED LEADS TO THEIR CONSERVATION THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE QUANTITY IS SOMETHING ELSE WHEN A SYSTEM DOESN'T POSSESS SAID SYMMETRY WHEN THE SYMMETRY DOESN'T EXIST THE QUANTITY JUST ISN'T CONSERVED
ENERGY IS THAT QUANTITY THAT IS ALWAYS CONSERVED AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE LAWS OF PHYSICS NOT CHANGING OVER TIME THIS IS USUALLY EXPRESSED VIA THEOREM WHICH LINKS SYMMETRIES OF PHYSICAL LAW IN THIS CASE SYMMETRY WITH CONSERVED QUANTITIES

THEOREM CONCERNS LOCAL SYMMETRIES WHICH AS ANOTHER POSTER POINTS OUT MEANS THAT ENERGY IS ONLY TRULY CONSERVED LOCALLY HOWEVER IN PRINCIPLE WE CAN CONSIDER LOTS OF LOCAL PATCHES OF SPACETIME ADD UP THEIR ENERGY INFLOW AND OUTFLOW AND STITCH THEM TOGETHER TO CREATE A GRAND LEDGER THAT ACCOUNTS FOR ALL EXCHANGES OF ENERGY IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE GOING BACK TO THE BIG BANG

WHICH I THINK IS REALLY YOUR ANSWER THE ENERGY CURRENTLY IN THE UNIVERSE CAME OUT OF THE BIG BANG IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER THE QUARKS IN YOUR HADRON GOT THEIR ENERGY THROUGH A LONG SERIES OF ENERGETIC INTERACTIONS STRETCHING BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THE UNIVERSE THAT PREDATES THE VERY EXISTENCE OF THOSE PARTICLES THEMSELVES

HOW THE BIG BANG GOT ALL THAT ENERGY WE CAN'T YET SAY AND WE DON'T KNOW IF WE'LL EVER BE ABLE TO SAY SO FAR THE BEST WE CAN DO TO TRACE BACK THE EVOLUTION OF THE UNIVERSE USING THE LAWS OF PHYSICS THAT WE KNOW ONLY TAKES US TO A FRACTION OF A SECOND AFTER THE BANG
FIRST LET ME EMPHASIZE THAT ENERGY IS INDEED A PROPERTY NOT AN OBJECT THINGS CAN'T BE ENERGY OR BE MADE OF ENERGY AND THE PHRASE PURE ENERGY BELONGS FIRMLY IN THE DOMAIN OF SCI-FI

AS A PHILOSOPHER THIS BEGS THE QUESTION THEN WHERE DID THAT ENERGY ORIGINATE

AS PHYSICISTS WE DON'T REALLY THINK ABOUT THOSE QUESTIONS THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN I MEAN IT'S FUN TO SPECULATE SOMETIMES BUT ULTIMATELY PHYSICS ALWAYS INVOLVES SOME SORT OF INITIAL STATE WHICH WE BASICALLY TAKE FOR GRANTED WE DON'T ASK WHERE THE ENERGY COMES FROM BECAUSE IT WAS ALREADY THERE IN THE INITIAL STATE

SO QUARKS AND GLUONS INSIDE HADRONS MOVE CHAOTICALLY AROUND CREATING KINETIC ENERGY WHICH GIVES HADRONS A LOT OF MASSACHUSETTS WHERE DOES THIS KINETIC ENERGY COME FROM

THAT'S A PARTICULARLY MESSY BUSINESS BECAUSE WE DON'T FIND QUARKS AND GLUONS ON THEIR OWN THEY'VE BEEN BOUND UP INTO HADRONS WITH THE REQUISITE KINETIC ENERGY SINCE NEARLY THE BEGINNING OF THE UNIVERSE YOU HAVE TO PUMP IN A HUGE AMOUNT OF ENERGY TO BREAK A QUARK OR GLUON OUT OF ITS PARENT HADRON THIS IS PART OF WHY WE MAKE GIANT PARTICLE ACCELERATORS

IT'S COMMONLY SUSPECTED THAT BEFORE THAT THE UNIVERSE CONSISTED OF A PLASMA WHERE THE ENERGY PER PARTICLE WAS SO HIGH THAT QUARKS AND GLUONS DID HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY TO OVERCOME THE FORCES TENDING TO PULL THEM TOGETHER INTO HADRONS AS THE UNIVERSE EXPANDED AND COOLED THIS PLASMA CONDENSED INTO HADRONS SO YOU COULD SAY THE ENERGY CAME FROM THE PLASMA BUT THAT'S JUST PUSHING THE QUESTION OFF BY ANOTHER STEP YOU COULD JUST AS WELL ASK WHERE THE ENERGY OF THE PLASMA CAME FROM

FOR THE HIGGS MECHANISMS THE SAME APPLIES IF THIS MECHANISM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ELECTRONS ACQUIRING MASS THEN I THINK THERE MUST ALSO BE SOME CONSERVED ENERGY IN THIS HIGGS FIELD

THAT ONE'S A LITTLE FUNNY BECAUSE THE HIGGS FIELD IS ACTUALLY AT AN ENERGY LIKE IF THERE WERE NO HIGGS FIELD THE UNIVERSE WOULD HAVE ENERGY THAN IT DOES NOW BUT FOR SOME REASON THERE IS AN ALTERNATE CONFIGURATION THAT HAS OUR CURRENT MINIMIZED LEVEL OF ENERGY AND THAT CONFIGURATION REQUIRES THE EXISTENCE OF A HIGGS FIELD WITH A NONZERO VALUE THE MASS GAINED BY ELECTRONS AND MUONS AND TAU LEPTONS AND QUARKS AND W AND Z BOSONS FROM THEIR INTERACTION WITH THE HIGGS FIELD IS LESS THAN THE AMOUNT LOST BY INTRODUCING A HIGGS FIELD

I MEAN THAT'S A VERY APPROXIMATE NONTECHNICAL DESCRIPTION BUT I THINK IT GETS THE IDEA ACROSS
MY FIRST GUESS IS SAME AS MANY OTHERS HERE WHICH IS THAT ENERGY IS MOST EASILY AND CLEARLY DEFINED VIA THEOREM THAT RAISES AN INTERESTING POINT WHICH IS THAT ENERGY IS DEFINED BY ITS CONSERVATION IN A SYSTEM AND HENCE THE STATEMENT OF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY IS ESSENTIALLY A TAUTOLOGY I HAVEN'T REALLY THOUGHT OF IT THAT WAY BEFORE
WATCH V

IN FRENCH IF YOU UNDERSTAND IT
DE QUAI EST ELLE LE NOM ETIENNE KLEIN SCIENCE PHILOSOPHER
ENERGY HAS NO REAL GREATER DEFINITION THAN THE MATHEMATICAL BOOK-KEEPING ROLE IT PLAYS IN DESCRIBING A SYSTEM THE MOST ACCURATE DEFINITIONS OF ENERGY SUCH AS THE CAPACITY TO DO WORK ARE FAIRLY UNSATISFYING IF YOU'RE EXPECTING SOMETHING REALLY INTERESTING

THEN WHERE DID THAT ENERGY ORIGINATE

WHO KNOWS IGNORING CURRENT COSMOLOGICAL ISSUES FOR A MOMENT ONE CAN SAY THE UNIVERSE WAS ALLOTTED POSSESSES A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF ENERGY IN THE BEGINNING AND THAT'S ALL THAT CAN BE EXPERIMENTALLY VERIFIED THERE IS THE ADDITIONAL COMPLEXITY HERE OF DARK ENERGY AND THE FACT THAT THE EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE IS ACCELERATING WHICH IMPLIES ENERGY IS BEING CREATED IN A MANNER TO ESSENTIALLY KEEP ENERGY DENSITY ABOVE A CERTAIN LEVEL AS SPACE EXPANDS SOMEONE ELSE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS MORE NOT MY FIELD HOWEVER ON SCALES LIKE IN A PARTICLE COLLIERS ENERGY IS CONSERVED

ENERGY IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF AFT AND HIGGS FIELDS AND STUFF IS ESSENTIALLY THE AMOUNT OF CONSERVED CURRENCY AVAILABLE TO EXCITE THE VARIOUS FIELDS WHY THAT MUCH CURRENCY WELL WHY FIELDS WHY ANYTHING PHYSICS IS IN THE BUSINESS OF CONSTRUCTING QUANTITATIVE MODELS THAT MATCH EXPERIMENT WE HAVE VERY ACCURATE VERIFIABLE MODELS OF THESE THINGS AND ONE OF THE KEY PARAMETERS IS THE ENERGY OF THE SYSTEM

ONE THING THE AUTHOR FAILS TO MENTION HERE IS THE COSMOLOGICAL PROOF OF PARTICLE DARK MATTER I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY PROOF OF CONCEPT OF MODIFIED GRAVITY EXPLAINING THE CB DATA TO DESCRIBE THE CORRELATION FUNCTION AND ITS PEAKS OVER MULTIPOLE MOMENTS I'M PRETTY SURE WE GET AMAZING FITS WITH COLD DARK MATTER
OH GOD NOT THIS AGAIN
INTERESTING ARTICLE HOWEVER I FOUND THIS ARTICLE WHICH IS LINKED FROM IT EVEN MORE INTERESTING COMBINES BOTH IDEAS
ISN'T GRAVITY LIKELY A PARTICLE TOO
WAIT DIDN'T WE DETERMINE A FEW WEEKS AGO THAT DARK MATTER WAS JUST BLACK HOLES
HERE IS A RECOMMENDED DOC THAT COVERS MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT TO EXPECT IN PREPARING FOR A PHYSICS EDUCATION INCLUDING MATH THE LIFE OF A PHYSICS MAJOR PREPARING FOR AND SURVIVING GRAD SCHOOL CHOOSING A RESEARCH AREA AND ADVISOR GETTING A JOB ETC
GETTING A PHD IS GREAT BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE BEST SOME PEOPLE SIMPLY DON'T NEED IT FOR THEIR CAREER PATHOLOGY

YOU SHOULD DISCUSS YOUR IDEAS WITH PROFESSORS AND STUDENTS WHO YOU TRUST IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THAT ANYONE WILL TRY TO STEAL ANY OF YOUR IDEAS SO DON'T WORRY SO MUCH ABOUT IT

YOU'LL KNOW YOU'RE ON TO SOMETHING WHEN YOUR IDEA MANAGES TO PERFECTLY EXPLAIN SOME PHENOMENA WITHOUT VIOLATING GR OR QUANTUM MECHANICS IN SOME WAY AT LEAST UNTIL YOU KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THEM TO FEEL COMFORTABLE VIOLATING THEM IF YOUR MATH HOLDS TRUE

I CAN'T REALLY RECOMMEND ANY SPECIFIC BOOKS FOR YOUR LEVEL BUT I WILL SAY THAT YOUTUBE IS A FANTASTIC RESOURCE FOR LEARNING ABOUT PHYSICS

WE DON'T GET AS MANY MAJOR DISCOVERIES THESE DAYS BECAUSE PHYSICS HAS GOTTEN A HELL OF A LOT HARDER WE HAVE VERY FEW LONE PHYSICISTS ANYMORE AND MOST GROUNDBREAKING RESEARCH THEORETICAL OR EXPERIMENTAL TAKES AGES AND SOMETIMES LOTS AND LOTS OF MONEY TO COMPLETE

PERSONALLY I LOVE THE INSANITY OF ALL OF IT THE UNIVERSE IS THE PERFECT COMPLEXITY MACHINE
HOW GOOD ARE THE PROSPECTS FOR PHYSICISTS IN FINANCE RELATED FIELDS I KNOW IT IS STUPID TO STUDY PHYSICS TO FIND A JOB IN FINANCE BUT I ALREADY CHANGED FROM AEROSPACE ENGINEERING TO PHYSICS AND SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD TO CHANGE AGAIN

I'VE HEARD THAT PHYSICISTS CHEMISTS AND MATHEMATICIANS ARE HIGHLY VALUED IN THE FINANCE SECTOR EVEN MORE THAT PEOPLE WITH RELATED DEGREES ARE THEY CONFINED TO VERY SPECIFIC ROLES OR DO THEY WORK IN AN ENVIRONMENT WITH POSSIBILITY TO ASCEND IN THE HIERARCHY

BEING POOR I REALIZED THAT I LOVE MONEY MORE THAN I LOVE DOING SCIENCE AND I DON'T WANT TO SPEND MY LIFE IN AN ACADEMIC BUBBLE EITHER SO THOSE ARE MY REASONS

THANKS

HOW CAN I MAXIMISE MY CHANCES OF GETTING A RESEARCH POSITION AFTER PHD

CURRENTLY UNDERGRAD BUT I'M NEARING THE END OF MY DEGREE AND REALISING THAT RESEARCH POSITIONS IN RADIO ASTRONOMY ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN MY GRADES ARE GOOD AND I HAVE SOME RESEARCH EXPERIENCE ALONG WITH MORE PLANNED BUT WHAT ELSE CAN I DO TO DISTINGUISH MYSELF FROM MY PEERS IT'S STARTING TO GET TO THE TIME WHERE I HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO GIVE ASTRO MY ALL OR LOOK FOR A MORE OPEN FIELD OF PHYSICS RESEARCH TO ENTER
HOW IS THE COMMUNICATION AT YOUR WORKPLACE DO YOU HAVE A FEW INDIVIDUALS YOU USUALLY WORK TOGETHER WITH OR DO THEY VARY ARE YOU COMFORTABLE TALKING TO YOUR BOSS ABOUT ANY PROBLEM YOU MAY BE HAVING WHERE DO YOU GO TO FIND OUT STUFF YOU NEED TO KNOW FOR WORK
IT WOULD BE NICE TO BE ABLE TO COMPARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PHYSICS RELATED JOBS IN THIS WAY I'M REALLY CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR STORIES
HI I AM NOT A PHYSICIST BUT FIRST YEAR CHEMISTRY STUDENT PLEASE DON'T BE MAD AT ME

OTHER STUDENTS FROM DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS LAUGH AT US THEY SAY THAT GOOD PHYSICIST IS ALSO A CHEMIST BUT GOOD CHEMIST IS NOT A PHYSICIST

MY QUESTION IS WHAT SHOULD I LEARN TO BE A CHEMIST WITH A GOOD KNOWLEDGE OF PHYSICS AS A CHEMISTRY STUDENTS WE TAKE PHYSICS I AND II AND PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY I AND II CLASSES ONLY
APPARENTLY WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT YOU CAME ACROSS THE APG IMAGE BY ITSELF WITHOUT THE LECTURE TEXT THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT THE LECTURE TEXT IS HERE

THE TABLE OF CONTENTS FOR THE COMPLETE LECTURE THAT THIS IS A PART OF IS HERE

THAT CUP HAS A AIR GAP BETWEEN THE HOT PART AND THE OUTSIDE PART AIR DRY AIR IS ONE OF THE BEST HEAT INSULATORS THERE IS
IT IS WORTH MENTIONING THAT THE RACQUETBALL IS HOLLOW WHEREAS THE BB IS SOLID THIS GIVES AN I M R 2 RATIO OF FOR THE RACQUETBALL AND FOR THE BB

BASICALLY FOR A GIVEN TOTAL MASS AND SIZE A HOLLOW SPHERE WILL NEED MORE ENERGY FOR ROTATION THAN A SOLID SPHERE

THAT SAID BOTH THE HOLLOW AND THE SOLID SPHERE WILL ROLL UNDER IDEALIZED THEORETICAL CONDITIONS IDEAL IN THIS CASE BEING PERFECTLY SPHERES UNIFORM DISTRIBUTIONS OF MASS SMOOTH SURFACES SUFFICIENT FRICTION TO ROLL WITHOUT SLIDING THIS IS NEEDED TO REMOVE THE COEFFICIENT OF FRICTION FROM THE MODEL
BECAUSE THIS ISN'T WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING SOME PART OF THE IDEALIZATION MUST BE BREAKING DOWN WE CAN CHECK EACH EITHER BY TEST OR OBSERVATION

ARE EITHER OF THE SPHERES SLIDING INSTEAD OF ROLLING IF SO OUR ASSUMPTION ABOUT COEFFICIENT OF FRICTION WILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED

DOES THE BEHAVIOUR REMAIN CONSTANT AS YOU MOVE AROUND THE SURFACE FOR TEST LOCATIONS IF SO THEN MOST LIKELY THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT THE SURFACE WE NEED TO ADD TO THE MODEL

DOES THE BEHAVIOR DEPEND ON THE INITIAL ORIENTATION OF THE SPHERES IF NOT OUR ASSUMPTION ABOUT UNIFORM MASS IS PROBABLY ALL RIGHT

BASED ON WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD US I THINK OUR MODEL BREAKS DOWN AT THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE SPHERES REMAIN HARD AND SPHERICAL WHICH UNFORTUNATELY IS VERY HARD TO DEVISE A GOOD EXPERIMENTAL TEST TO VERIFY

TL R I THINK YOU ARE ON POINT RE THE FLAT SPOT
IF THE RADIUS IS LARGER IT WILL HAVE A LARGER MOMENT OF INERTIA AND LESS LIKELY TO MOVE ALSO DEPENDING ON THE MATERIAL IT MAY HA E A HIGHER FRICTION COEFFICIENT AND THEN NOT MOVE BECAUSE OF FRICTION
I CAME TO A SIMILAR CONCLUSION AS YOU DID THAT THE RACQUETBALL IS COMPRESSIBLE AND THEREFORE FLATTENS A TINY BIT AT THE BOTTOM MAKING IT LESS LIKELY TO ROLL TELL YOUR FRIEND HE'S THE STOOPED ONE
I THINK YOUR THEORY IS CORRECT UNDER THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS

IN A VACUUM

BALLS ARE PERFECTLY SPHERICAL WHEN UNCOMPRESSED

TABLE SURFACE IS PERFECTLY SMOOTH

TABLE SURFACE IS INCOMPRESSIBLE

NEITHER OF THE BALLS IS STICKIER THAN THE OTHER FRICTION IS JUST ENOUGH TO PREVENT THE BALLS FROM GLIDING OFF

THE LAST ASSUMPTION IS ONE THAT YOU MADE WHILE REFUTING YOUR FRIEND'S ARGUMENT FROM YOUR POST IT ISN'T REALLY CLEAR WHAT THE SURFACE THE BALLS ROLL ON IS MADE OF CARDBOARD WOOD GLASS I SUGGEST CHECKING WHETHER THE SECOND TO LAST ASSUMPTION APPLIES


YOU'RE COMPLETELY RIGHT EXCEPT THE FRICTION PLAYING A ROLE IT DOES WHEN THE BALL IS ALREADY MOVING WHEN IT'S AT REST INSTANTANEOUS TORQUE ACTS ABOUT ONLY THE POINT OF CONTACT NOT ON THE CENTER OF MASSACHUSETTS
ONE THING TO NOTE UNLESS YOUR TABLE IS STEEL OR CONCRETE IT LIKELY HAS A VERY MINUTE DEPRESSION IN THE SURFACE WHERE THE RACQUETBALL IS SITTING THE BB WOULDN'T HAVE ENOUGH WEIGHT I WOULDN'T THINK TO MAKE ANY MEASURABLE CHANGE THAT SAID IT MAY NOT BE ENOUGH OF A DIFFERENCE TO STOP IT FROM ROLLING

I HAVE A IDEA THAT I DON'T SEE POSTED YET WHAT IF THE RACQUETBALL HAS A MASS DISTRIBUTION IF THE COM WAS SLIGHTLY OFF CENTER THIS COULD PROVIDE A TORQUE THAT COUNTERBALANCES THE TORQUE PROVIDED BY THE TANGENTIAL COMPONENT OF THE NORMAL FORCE AN EXPERIMENT COULD BE DESIGNED TO SEE IF IT WERE A SIMILAR SPOT THAT THE RACQUETBALL SEEMED TO SETTLE ON THUS IMPLYING THAT IT NEEDED THE OFF-CENTER COM ON THE UPHILL SIDE OF THE CONTACT POINT IF IT STOPS ISOTOPICALLY THEN MY THEORY IS MOST LIKELY DISPROVEN
SO ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION WILL HAVE SOME PLAY AS TO WHY A BALL NEEDS A FORCE TO MOVE THUS STATIC FRICTION MY GUESS IS THAT THERE IS MORE ELECTROSTATIC BETWEEN THE RACQUETBALL AND THE TABLE THAN THE OTHER BALLS
YEA ROLLING RESISTANCE IS THE CLEAR DOMINANT FACTOR HERE
YOU ARE BOTH RIGHT EXPLANATION 2 FITS AND OVERALL THIS EFFECT IS CALLED ROLLING RESISTANCE OR ROLLING FRICTION WHICH FITS TO THE KEYWORD IN EXPLANATION
MAYBE THE CENTRE OF MASS ISNT REALLY AT THE CENTRE SO ITLL ROLL TO KEEP IT AT THE LOWEST POSSIBLE POINT AND MAYBE THE POSITIONS YOU PLACED IT AT HAD THE CENTRE OF MASS ON ONE SIDE
I COULD VERY WELL BE WRONG BUT I'D GUESS THAT STATIC FRICTION IS AT LEAST PARTLY DUE TO VAN DER WAALS FORCE WHICH HAS TO BE OVERCOME WHEN ROLLING OR PICKING THE BALL I'D STILL GUESS THAT THE COMPRESSION STILL MAKES THE BIGGER DIFFERENCE
GOOD ON YOU FOR GETTING IN ON PHYSICS SO EARLY I MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP BUT I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED AS TO WHAT YOUR QUESTION IS WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
UNLESS YOU KNOW ABOUT 3D FLUID MECHANICS DON'T BOTHER LOOKING INTO THIS YET THIS IS A VERY COMPLICATED PROBLEM
SOME OTHER CONTROVERSIAL WERE PASCUAL JORDAN FOR HIS WORK IN QUANTUM MECHANICS BUT PROBABLY DIDN'T WIN BECAUSE HE WAS HEAVILY INVOLVED WITH THE NAZI PARTY

JOCELYN BELL BRUNELL FOR DISCOVERING PULSARS EVEN THOUGH HER ADVISER WON WHEN SHE WAS THE ONE TO ACTUALLY DISCOVER THEM HER OWN EXPLANATION ON WHY SHE THINKS SHE DIDN'T WIN IS ON HER WIKI PAGE

JOHN STEWARD BELL WAS ALSO NOMINATED THE YEAR HE DIED FOR HIS INEQUALITY STUFF AND THEY DON'T AWARD THEM POSTHUMOUSLY

THERE ARE PROBABLY MANY OTHER STORIES LIKE THESE BUT THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES I AM FAMILIAR WITH SEEMS LIKE NORTHERN IRISH PHYSICISTS ARE CURSED THOUGH



I HAD A LOOK THROUGH THE EARLY NOBEL PRIZES IN PHYSICS A WHILE AGO AND TWO PEOPLE STOOD OUT PRIMARILY BECAUSE I HAD NEVER HEARD OF THEM EVERYONE ELSE THAT WAS AWARDED PRIZES BACK THEN ARE FAIRLY WELL KNOWN NOW WITH THEIR SURNAMES ATTACHED TO AT LEAST ONE PHENOMENON AND AFTER LOOKING AT THEIR WIKI PAGES IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE THEY ACCOMPLISHED MUCH OR WERE WELL RENOWNED

GUSTAF DALAN FOR FOR HIS INVENTION OF AUTOMATIC VALVES DESIGNED TO BE USED IN COMBINATION WITH GAS ACCUMULATORS IN LIGHTHOUSES AND BUOYS IN


MANNE SIEGBAHN FOR FOR HIS DISCOVERIES AND RESEARCH IN THE FIELD OF X-RAY SPECTROSCOPY IN


SO THEY ARE BOTH SWEDISH AND TO ME IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE THAT IS WHY THEY MIGHT HAVE WON IT AS THE AUTHOR OF THIS ARTICLE WRITES IN PHYSICS THE SELECTION COMMITTEE IN THE EARLY YEARS WAS DOMINATED BY SWEDISH EXPERIMENTALISTS

IS ANYONE WELL VERSED IN THE HISTORY OF AUTOMATIC VALVES AND GAS ACCUMULATORS OR X-RAY SPECTROSCOPY ABLE TO CORRECT ME ON THAT WAS THEIR WORK DESERVING



JOHN UPDIKE WAIT WRONG THREAD
FRED HOYLE WAS EXPLICITLY SNUBBED BY THE NOBEL COMMITTEE HIS JUNIOR COLLABORATOR WILLIAM FOWLER WON THE PRIZE FOR STELLAR NUCLEOSYNTHESIS YET HOYLE WAS IGNORED APPARENTLY THE COMMITTEE PASSED HIM OVER BECAUSE OF HIS CRACKPOT BELIEFS IN OTHER FIELDS SUCH AS MICROBIOLOGY AND PALEONTOLOGY HE HAD ALSO DIRECTLY CRITICIZED THE COMMITTEE WHEN THEY FAILED TO INCLUDE JOCELYN BELL IN THE PRIZE

HERE'S A GOOD ARTICLE ON THE CONTROVERSY

ALSO KENNETH WILSON THE SOLE WINNER OF THE PHYSICS PRIZE HAS STATED THAT LEO KADANOFF SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED AS WELL
HERE ARE SOME MORE CONTROVERSIAL


ARNOLD SOMMERFELD
LIKE EVERYTHING IN LIFE HARDWORK DISCIPLINE AND PERSEVERANCE CAN TAKE YOU VERY FAR
LEONARD LECTURES ARE MEANT FOR EXACTLY FOR SOMEONE LIKE YOURSELF HIS BOOK THE THEORETICAL MINIMUM IS WORTH PICKING UP
LEARNING PHYSICS QM ESPECIALLY FROM A IER BACKGROUND IS TOTALLY DOABLE BUT IT REALLY DEPENDS ON YOU U RECOMMENDATION OF SHANKAR IS A GOOD ONE GRIFFITHS WOULD WORK TOO YOU'VE ALREADY HAD INTRO PHYSICS SO YOU DON'T NEED FEYNMAN LECTURES OR HALLIDAY RESNICK ETC

IT WOULD BE BETTER IF YOU COULD DO IT WHILE YOU'RE STILL ON YOUR CAMPUS SO YOU CAN GO TALK TO PHYSICS FACULTY TO DISCUSS THE TRICKY PARTS
I MIGHT SUGGEST MODERN PHYSICS BY KRANE THE 2ND EDITION IS FINE AND IS ON AMAZON FOR IT'S NICE BECAUSE IT STARTS OFF RIGHT WHERE AN INTRODUCTORY TEXT ENDS IT PRESENTS THE MATERIAL A BIT IN THE ORDER IT WAS DISCOVERED SO YOU GET SOME HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE ON SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT AND REASONING IT WOULD THEN BE FOLLOWED BY SOMETHING LIKE GRIFFITHS IT'S BASICALLY A BRIDGE BETWEEN INTRODUCTORY PHYSICS AND JUNIOR LEVEL PHYSICS MAJOR STUFF

YES IT IS I WOULD SUGGEST MIT OPEN COURSEWARE AND JUST BE DISCIPLINED
THIS HELPED ME TREMENDOUSLY IN MY MODERN QUANTUM CLASS
SURE IT'S POSSIBLE QM BOOK IS VERY GOOD
WITH ENOUGH TIME AND PERSEVERANCE YOU CAN TEACH YOURSELF PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING
OF COURSE IT IS ALMOST ALL OF UNIVERSITY YOU LEARN BY YOURSELF WITH A BIT OF GUIDANCE FROM YOUR PROF PICK UP GRIFFITHS AND WORK FROM THROUGH AND IF YOU'RE STILL MORE INTERESTED IN THE MATHEMATICAL FORMALISM CHECK OUT SAKURAI

GRIFFITHS WHILE THE MATHEMATICS IS LACKING I FIND DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB HELPING WITH THE CONCEPTS
IT'S POSSIBLE TO INVENT QUANTUM AND MODERN PHYSICS SO OF COURSE YOU CAN LEARN IT
ASSUMING YOU KNOW CALCULUS FROM ENGINEERING SURE FEYNMAN LECTURES WOULD PROBABLY BE PERFECT FOR YOU SHOULD BE A GOOD MIX OF PHYSICS AT THE RIGHT LEVEL
YES YOU ABSOLUTELY CAN LEARN IT ON YOUR OWN MIGHT I RECOMMEND BOOK AS A GOOD PLACE TO START

YOU'RE PROBABLY ALSO INTERESTED IN RELATIVITY WHICH BOOK YOU GET HAS A LOT TO DO WITH YOUR PRIOR EXPOSURE TO THE SUBJECT AND HOW DEEP YOU WANT TO GET INTO IT HERE'S THE PROGRESSION I WOULD RECOMMEND

IF YOU'VE NEVER HAD ANY RELATIVITY BEFORE START WITH THIS CUTE LITTLE BOOK BY ROBERT RESNICK THIS BOOK TAKES YOU THROUGH THE BASICS OF DOING SPECIAL RELATIVISTIC CALCULATIONS WITHOUT GETTING MUCH INTO THE GEOMETRY OF SPACETIME

2 IF YOU HAVE SOME EXPOSURE TO GR OR HAVE ALREADY READ THE PREVIOUS BOOK I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE NEXT BEST STANDALONE SPECIAL RELATIVITY BOOK IS THAT INTRODUCES YOU TO USING TENSORS AND GETS A LITTLE BIT INTO THE GEOMETRY OF SPACETIME YOU COULD READ THE LAST CHAPTER OF GRIFFITHS OR THE CHAPTER ON RELATIVITY IN JACKSON FROM WHAT I RECALL YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO READ THESE CHAPTERS WITHOUT TOO MUCH TROUBLE IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE REST OF THIS BOOK BUT DON'T QUOTE ME ON THAT

AFTER THAT YOU'RE PROBABLY READY FOR GENERAL RELATIVITY I REALLY LIKE BOOK

IF YOU WANT TO GET EVEN DEEPER WALD IS PROBABLY THE WAY TO GO BTW IS ANOTHER OPTION THERE ARE ALSO REALLY GOOD YOUTUBE LECTURES OUT THERE IF YOU GET TO THIS POINT IT MIGHT BE WORTH YOUTUBING A GUY NAMED FREDERIC SCHULLER HE HAS AN EXCELLENT LECTURE ON GENERAL RELATIVITY THAT IS ALSO MORE MATHEMATICAL THAN CARROLL

ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU WANT TO JUMP STRAIGHT INTO ASTROPHYSICS WITHOUT LEARNING ALL THE FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS THAT I'VE OUTLINED HERE THERE ARE OPTIONS OUT THERE FOR THAT TOO FROM WHAT I HEAR YOU DEFINITELY WON'T HAVE AS DEEP AS AN UNDERSTANDING BUT A HIGH-LEVEL UNDERSTANDING IS STILL VALUABLE AND MAY BE EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT I DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT SAID IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS ROUTE YOU'LL HAVE TO GET SOMEONE ADVICE ON THAT I'M NOT TOO FAMILIAR WITH INTRODUCTORY ASTROPHYSICS BOOKS ASIDE FROM WHAT OTHERS HAVE TOLD ME
SO I'M TAKING A QUANTUM MECHANICS CLASS ATM AND MY REQUIRED TEXT IS REALLY GOOD MCINTYRE QUANTUM MECHANICS I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT FOR MODERN PHYSICS PROBABLY HARRIS MODERN PHYSICS

THOUGH KEEP IN MIND THAT MOST OF QUANTUM IS APPLICATIONS OF LINEAR ALGEBRA AND DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS SO IT MIGHT SEEM DRUDGE IF DON'T LIKE MATHEMATICS UNLESS OF COURSE THE MATH PART FUN FOR YOU THEN QUANTUM IS REALLY INTERESTING
YOU NEED TO GET AS MUCH PRACTICE SOLVING PROBLEMS AS YOU CAN

BEYOND THAT IT DEPENDS ON HOW DEEP INTO THE RABBIT HOLE YOU'D LIKE TO GO

THERE ARE PLENTY OF GREAT TEXTBOOK RECOMMENDATIONS HERE SO I WON'T ADD EVEN MORE TO THE LIST BUT I'D SAY YOU SHOULD HAVE A LOOK IN THE LIBRARY AND FLICK THROUGH A FEW TEXTS MOST WILL COVER SIMILAR MATERIAL AND YOU CAN LOOK AT THE CONTENTS TO GET AN IDEA OF SIMILARITIES
THE ISSUE IS TEXTBOOKS CAN OCCASIONALLY SUBSTITUTE A DECENT LECTURE COURSE I SAY OCCASIONALLY BECAUSE THEY OFTEN OMIT THE USEFUL ANALOGIES AND EXPLANATIONS THAT A LECTURER CAN OFFER BUT IF YOU WANT TO GET A SOLID UNDERSTANDING YOU NEED TO PRACTICE PROBLEMS

I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF MATHS BACKGROUND YOU HAVE BUT YOU MAY FIND IT USEFUL TO INVEST IN A MATHEMATICS FOR PHYSICISTS TEXTBOOK SOMETHING WHICH COVERS MATRICES LINEAR ALGEBRA VECTOR CALCULUS AND 1ST 2ND ORDER DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS SHOULD DO YOU WELL IN MY EXPERIENCE THE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING COMES FROM HAVING A THOROUGH INTUITION OF THE UNDERLYING MATHS WHICH WILL HELP TO FURTHER SOLIDIFY THE PHYSICAL MODELS YOU DEVELOP IN YOUR HEAD THIS LIKE MOST THINGS COMES WITH PRACTICE IN THE FORM OF PROBLEMS

HOPE THIS HELPS GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR JOURNEY
FREDRICH SCHULLER HAS A COUPLE OF EXCELLENT VIDEO LECTURE SERIES ON YOUTUBE HERE'S A LINK TO HIS LECTURES ON QUANTUM THEORY

LECTURES ON QUANTUM THEORY
PLAYLIST LIST LP

I FOUND THEM TO BE VERY THOROUGH AND ENLIGHTENING I HOPE YOU FIND THE SAME
IN ORDER TO PROPERLY UNDERSTAND THOSE SUBJECTS YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE MATH BEHIND THEM TOO
GRIFFITHS CAN'T BE BEATEN FOR UNDERGRAD QUANTUM
BE SURE TO STUDY LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ODE REALLY THOROUGHLY AND YOU'LL HAVE ENOUGH OF A FOUNDATION TO PICK UP THE REST WITH HARD WORK
THERE ARE INTRO QUANTUM MECHANICS COURSES FOR FREE FROM MIT DEFINITELY CHECK THOSE OUT


THIS HELPED ME
AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A GOOD FOUNDATION ON CLASSICAL MECHANICS WHICH I ASSUME YOU DO HAVING AN ME MINOR AND STATISTICS I'M SURE YOU COULD SELF TEACH YOURSELF THE FUNDAMENTALS TO QM
LOTS OF GREAT ANSWERS IN THIS THREAD IF YOU WANT A SIMPLER APPROACH TO MODERN PHYSICS FIRST WHICH I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND BEFORE DIVING DEEPER MODERN PHYSICS FOR SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS WAS A GREAT UNDERGRADUATE TEXTBOOK BEFORE MOVING ON TO UPPER LEVEL BOOKS LIKE OR THE LIKE I BELIEVE TAYLOR IS MORE KNOWN FOR HIS UPPER LEVEL CLASSICAL MECHANICS BOOK BUT I THINK IT'S A GREAT OPENING IF YOU'VE ALREADY HAD INTRODUCTORY PHYSICS WHICH IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE

I ACTUALLY LEARNED QUANTUM NOT FROM BUT FROM A MODERN APPROACH TO QUANTUM MECHANICS HOWEVER I DID HAVE TO READ IT ON MY OWN I FOUND IT APPROACHABLE WITH THE BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE OF BOOK THOUGH I DID ALSO FORMALLY HAVE OTHER CLASSES WHICH I THINK HELPED FROM A MATHEMATICS PERSPECTIVE
YES IF YOU HAVE A BAD ENOUGH PROFESSOR HAHA
SQRT 2 Y EXP I PHI N
THEORETICAL MINIMUM WOULD BE A GREAT START
ONE THING WHICH NO ONE HAS MENTIONED YET A DECENT UNDERSTANDING OF VECTOR CALCULUS DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS AND LINEAR ALGEBRA WILL MAKE A LOT OF QM MAKE SENSE

KHAN ACADEMY WILL GET YOU UP TO DATE ON ALL THAT GRIFFITHS IS THE BEST UNDERGRAD TEXTBOOK SCHAURMS QM FOR PRACTICE QUESTIONS MIT OPEN COURSE WARE IF YOU NEED LECTURES
INTRO PHYSICS BOOK PROVIDES A REALLY GOOD TRANSITION FROM CLASSICAL TO MODERN PHYSICS IMO IT'S THE BOOK WE USED IN PHYS AND 2 AND MODERN AND ALTHOUGH I WENT TO CLASS ALMOST EVERY TIME MOST OF MY LEARNING WAS DONE IN MY OWN TIME WITH THIS BOOK READ EVERY LETTER ON EVERY PAGE AND DO EVERY EXAMPLE GOING BACK AFTER EACH SECTION OR CHAPTER TO REDO THE EXAMPLES TO MAKE SURE THE INFO STICKS AND YOU WILL BE BUENO
I'D LIKE TO THREAD I HOPE HE DOESN'T MIND

I COME FROM SIMILAR BACKGROUND TO OP AND WISH TO UNDERSTAND BCS THEORY I HEARD THAT IT IS A BEAUTIFUL THEORY CAN ANYONE RECOMMEND GOOD TEXTBOOKS
SURE IT'S POSSIBLE BUT IF YOU HAVE A JOB AND A LIFE ON THE SIDE IT WILL TAKE A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT

I RECOMMEND THAT YOU START WITH ROGER THE ROAD TO REALITY AND WORK YOUR WAY FROM THERE TAKE THEORETICAL MINIMUM VIDEO COURSES 2 BOOKS AND OF COURSE YOU SHOULD HAVE LECTURES ON PHYSICS
MIT YALE AND STANFORD HAVE LECTURES ON YOUTUBE I AM ACTUALLY CURRENTLY WATCHING THE MIT QUANTUM PHYSICS LECTURES NOW AND IT IS BLOWING MY MIND IF YOU GO INTO THE DESCRIPTION OF THE VIDEO THERE'S A LINK TO THE COURSE WEBSITE WHERE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THE LECTURE NOTES AND PROBLEM SETS WITH SOLUTIONS

I ALSO RECOMMEND A BOOK CALLED QUARKS THE STUFF OF MATTER BY HERALD FRITZSCHE IT IS OLD BUT IT WAS A GREAT INTRO FOR ME TO QUARKS AND HOW COLOR CHARGE WORKS IT'S MORE OF A QUALITATIVE BOOK SO THERE ISN'T ANY MATHEMATICS
I HOPE THIS COMMENT HELPS YOU JUMP FROM JUST THE INTRODUCTION TO FURTHER AFIELD

THE REAL QUESTION HERE I THINK IS WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW FROM QUANTUM MECHANICS OTHER USERS HAVE GIVEN GOOD RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BOOKS THAT INTRODUCE YOU TO QUANTUM MECHANICS HOWEVER A LOT OF PEOPLE ASK ME EITHER ABOUT PARTICLE STRING THEORY OR TELEPORTATION ENTANGLEMENT WHICH I CAN ANSWER PRETTY WELL ON SOMEONE ASKED ME LAST WEEK ABOUT BLACK HOLES WHICH I COULD GIVE PRETTY GOOD INFORMATION ABOUT BUT I'M GENERALLY NOT AN ASTRONOMY PERSON BUT DO COSMOLOGY

ONCE YOU HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING UP UNTIL YOU CAN UNDERSTAND DIRAC NOTATION AND HAVE LEARNT THINGS SUCH AS OPERATOR USAGE COMMUTATORS STATE TRANSITION PROBABILITY AND THUS PERTURBATION THEORY THEN YOU CAN GO INTO MORE SPECIFIC BRANCHES THESE TOPICS SHOULD BE IN ANY QUANTUM INTRO BOOK

FOR ENTANGLEMENT AND ALL THE COOL APPLICABLE TO EVERY DAY LIFE STUFF WHICH I'M SURE AN ENGINEER WOULD LOVE I RECOMMEND TAKING UP STUDY IN QUANTUM INFORMATION THEORY AIT WHICH KIND OF FOLLOWS FROM QUANTUM OPTICS AIT INCLUDES ENTANGLEMENT EXPERIMENTS AND LOCALITY ARGUMENTS ANSWERS TO THE NATURE OF A QUANTUM STATE QUANTUM COMPUTATIONAL ALGORITHMS COOL SOUNDING APPLICABLE TO TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENTS EVERY DAY PHYSICS NOTE SOME QUANTUM OPTICS BOOKS LIKE THE ONE BY MARK FOX DOES TEACH RELEVANT INTRO QUANTUM MECHANICS AT THE START AND TEACHES SOME AIT AT THE END I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FOR A JUMP START

ONE BRANCH THAT WILL BE INCREDIBLY HARD TO GET ANYTHING FROM BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE IS PARTICLE PHYSICS THERE WILL BE A POINT AFTER STUDYING AN INTRODUCTIONAL BOOK WHERE YOU CAN SAY I KNOW WHAT EXPERIMENTS ARE DOING EXACTLY BUT CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE FULL MECHANISMS INVOLVED IN EXPERIMENTS AND THAT THEORETICAL PARTICLE IS A LONG WAY OFF AND WOULD REQUIRE A LOT OF STUDY THIS WON'T BE WORTH YOUR TIME UNLESS YOU REALLY WANT TO GO INTO THESE FIELDS YOU CAN FIND A BOOK AIMED AT PUBLIC TO BREAK DOWN SOME NOTIONS OF STRING THEORY BUT I HAVE SEEN QUITE A FEW PEOPLE GOING FOR RIDICULOUS LYING SENSATIONALIST BOOKS SO I DONT RECOMMEND THIS ROUTE UNLESS WRITTEN BY SOMEONE WELL ESTABLISHED

ASTROPHYSICS IS A COOL FIELD BUT I JUST DON'T ENJOY STUDYING IT MY FRIEND SHOWS ME A GOOD IMAGE THEY GOT OF A STAR AND EXPLAIN HOW THEY MEASURED VARIOUS ASPECTS OF IT LIKE AGE TEMP DISTANCE ETC I JUST THINK COOL PROBLEM SOLVED NO FURTHER QUESTIONS I ONLY LIKE TO KNOW HOW HIGH DENSITY ENTITIES LIKE BLACK HOLES AND NEUTRON STARS WORK ANYWAY AS FAR AS I'M AWARE YOU JUST HAVE TO UNDERSTAND FROM QUANTUM MECHANICS WHY ENERGY IS REQUIRED FOR ELECTRON ORBITAL JUMPS ELECTRONS FREEING THEMSELVES FROM ATOMS ELECTRON BONDING MAYBE ATOMIC FUSION AND MAYBE SOME OTHER MECHANISMS BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO HARD I LEARNT ALL I NEEDED TO EVEN BEFORE I KNEW QUANTUM MECHANICS MATHEMATICS

EDIT SOME OTHER MAJOR FIELDS ARE QUANTUM SOLID STATE LIKE CRYSTALS AND SEMICONDUCTORS AND SUPERCONDUCTORS QUANTUM STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND MECHANICS BUILDS ON THIS BASICALLY DESCRIBES GASES IN EXPERIMENT ULTRA COLD GASES BUT ALSO CAN APPLY TO BLACK HOLES AND MAYBE ELECTRON TRANSPORT PHYSICS RELATED PHILOSOPHY STRONG RELATIONS TO INFORMATION THEORY ON THE NATURE OF QUANTUM STATES AND THE UNIVERSE CHEMISTRY AND QUANTUM BIOLOGY

SUPER CONDUCTORS ARE COOL GET IT BUT THE THEORETICAL SIDE OF IT IS CONFUSING AND REQUIRES DEVOTION LIKE THEORETICAL PARTICLE PHYSICS I DID A COURSE AT UNI SEMI AND SUPER CONDUCERS AND THAT IS ENOUGH FOR ME I LIKE TO CHECK IN EVERY NOW AND THEN AND SEE HOW HOT WE CAN GET A SUPER CONDUCTOR
HAS ANYONE USED OLDER BOOKS SUCH AS SCHRODINGER NEUMANN DIRAC ETC FROM MY EXPERIENCE WITH MATHEMATICS BOOKS I HAVE AN IMPRESSION THAT OLDER BOOKS CAN PROVIDE A LOT OF USEFUL INSIGHTS THAT MORE MODERN BOOKS DO NOT HAVE ON A CONDITION THAT THE READER IS PLANNED TO READ ADVANCED BOOKS AFTER READING THOSE OLDER BOOKS

SURE PICK UP A COPY OF EM GRIFFITHS CLASSICAL MECHANICS GOLDSTEIN AND QM SHANKAR

SHAKERS QM IS REALLY GREAT AND SELF CONTAINED
IF IN YOUR ENGINEERING PREPARATION YOU ALREADY HAVE A GOOD DECENT KNOWLEDGE OF ALGEBRA GEOMETRY CALCULUS AND CLASSICAL PHYSICS GOOD TO GO FOR INTRODUCTION TESTS IN QUANTUM MECHANICS AND SPECIAL RELATIVITY
WHATEVER TEXTBOOK RESOURCE YOU END OF USING DO ALL THE PRACTICE PROBLEMS YOU CAN WHEN SELF LEARNING IT IS EASY TO DISMISS THE NEED FOR PRACTICE AND OVERESTIMATE YOUR ABILITIES

I LOVE I WAS ABLE TO LEARN AND GET CREDIT FOR UNIVERSITY CALCULUS PHYSICS CHEMISTRY
YES I DO THANKS
GREAT COMMENT JUST WHAT I NEEDED YEAH I REALLY WANT TO LEARN THAT MAY BE APPLICABLE FOR ENGINEERS TOO THANKS
QUANTUM MECHANICS EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW TO START DOING PHYSICS BY LEONARD SUSSKIND AND SOME OTHER GUY GREAT RESOURCE NOT AFRAID OF MATHEMATICS
I AM A PHYSICS UNDERGRADUATE AT ONE OF THE TOP UNIVERSITIES IN THE WORLD SOME OF OUR LECTURERS ARE FANTASTIC AND MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE WHEN LEARNING SOME ARE SIMPLY READING THE NOTES VER BAHAM AND THEY GET CONFUSED AND LOST WHILE TEACHING WHICH DOESN'T HELP US AT ALL FOR THE LATTER WE ARE ESSENTIALLY FORCED TO TEACH OURSELVES OR TEACH EACH OTHER LUCKILY THE AFOREMENTIONED NOTES ARE VERY COMPREHENSIVE SO TEACHING OURSELVES IS NO ISSUE YOU ABSOLUTELY CAN LEARN MODERN PHYSICS INCLUDING QUANTUM PHYSICS ALL BY YOURSELF SO LONG AS YOU HAVE GOOD RESOURCES AVAILABLE JUST EXPECT IT TO TAKE A WHILE TO GRASP EVEN WITH THIS FORMAL EDUCATION SOME STUFF ONLY CLICKS A LONG TIME AFTER I HAVE SAT THE EXAMS THE TRICKIEST ASPECT IS LEARNING THAT YOU CAN ALWAYS GO DEEPER AND THUS INTO MORE COMPLICATED TERRITORY THE PROBLEMS WE STUDY ARE VERY MUCH SIMPLIFIED VERSIONS OF HOW THE WORLD WORKS IT IS ONLY WHEN WE HAVE A SOLID FOUNDATION DO WE MOVE ONTO HARDER AND SO USUALLY MORE REALISTIC PROBLEMS ALSO EXPECT THERE TO BE SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS OF LOOKING AT THE SAME PROBLEM

I COULD GO ON AND ON
IN THE BIBLE NAHUM
YOU SHOULD STAR BY READING QUANTUM ELECTRO DYNAMICS BY RICHARD FEYNMAN IT IS AN EXCEDENT STARTING POINT FOR QUANTUM PHYSICS
YES BUT FORGET ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE AND HONE IN ON THAT NARROW SUBJECT AND THEN GET DIAGNOSED WITH ASPERGER
THE PROBLEM WOULD BE THAT PLANETS ARE MOVING WITH RESPECT TO EACH OTHER SO A KIND OF TRANSPORTATION THAT IS FIXED IN POSITION AS THE HYPER LOOP WOULD BE WOULD BE REALLY IMPRACTICAL ONE MOMENT YOU WILL BE FLYING TO MARS SOME TIME LATER AND YOU WOULD BE IN THE BIDLE OF NOWHERE
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN
AS HAS BEEN SAID YOU COULD BUT THEN EVERY TRAJECTORY HAS TO THREAD THE NEEDLE LIKE IF YOU'RE GOING FROM THE EARTH TO MARS THE EXACT SECOND YOU LEAVE WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT EFFECT ON YOUR TRAJECTORY SO THAT YOU WOULD MISS SUCH A THING IF YOU WERE A SECOND LATER AND OF COURSE FOR A SECOND PERSON TO USE THAT THING THE CHANCES OF THERE BEING ANOTHER EARTH TO MARS TRAJECTORY THAT THREADS THAT EXACT SPOT AT ANY LATER DATE ARE PROBABLY MATHEMATICALLY ZERO

ON TOP OF THIS ONCE YOU'VE GONE THROUGH YOUR TRAJECTORY WILL ENTIRELY CHANGE BECAUSE YOUR SPEED HAS INCREASED WHICH MEANS TO HIT YOUR DESTINATION THE INITIAL TRAJECTORY HAD TO BE A WRONG ONE AND ONLY AFTER THE BOOST ARE YOU ON THE RIGHT ONE THIS MEANS IF YOU SHOULD MISS THAT THING YOU'RE BASICALLY SCREWED AND JUST GOING OFF INTO SPACE
SHOTS FIRED AT THE BIOLOGISTS
DID THEY JUST WAIT FOR THE NOBEL PRIZE TO BE AWARD IT AND THEN AWARD IT FOR THE SAME THING SOMETHING SIMILAR HAPPENED LAST YEAR WHEN THE FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS PRIZE WENT TO SEVERAL NEUTRINO RESEARCHERS
START BY LOOKING AT EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT DO THIS SOME EXAMPLES

USING TIME DOMAIN BEEP

USING FINITE ELEMENT METHOD CONSOL FSS CST
YOU WANT A FINITE DIFFERENCE TIME DOMAIN CODE SEE THE BOOK BY TAFLOVE SEE MY APP CALLED WIFI SOLVER FOR A FUN APPLICATION OF DTD
HOW ABOUT HELMHURTS
MAYBE YOU ARE INTERESTED IN WRITING A
I WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND YOU TAKE A LOOK AT LUMBRICAL DTD
SCHUTZ AND CARROLL ARE THE MORE BEGINNER FRIENDLY BOOKS I'D RECOMMEND YOU START WITH THOSE AND THEN SEE WHAT YOU WANT
I'M GONNA RECOMMEND CARROLL FOR A MORE PHYSICKY APPROACH O'NEILL IS GREAT BUT MIGHT BE OVERKILL FOR A FIRST ROUND CARROLL FOLLOWS ALONG VERY SIMILAR TO WALD SO THE TWO OF THEM COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER VERY WELL

ANOTHER ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC BOOK IS EINSTEIN GRAVITY IN A NUTSHELL BY A ZEE I CAN'T RECOMMEND IT ENOUGH IT'S NEW AND IS AS UP TO DATE AS YOU CAN EXPECT IT IS EXTREMELY ACCESSIBLE ALL THE WHILE NOT DUMBING IT DOWN EITHER AS A CONSEQUENCE IT'S A PAGE NUTSHELL SO THERE IS THAT

FINALLY PERIMETER SCHOLARS INTERNATIONAL HAS A FEW REALLY GOOD LECTURES SERIES ON THE SUBJECT I'LL TRY AND REMEMBER TO POST A LINK LATER WHEN I'M AT A COMPUTER OR JUST GOOGLE PSI LECTURES


EDIT HERE IS THE LINK

TRAINING

PERSONALLY I REALLY LIKED NEIL LECTURE SERIES FROM BUT CHECK THEM ALL OUT
DO YOU HAVE PDE BACKGROUND
WE USED AN INTRODUCTION TO TENSOR CALCULUS AND RELATIVITY BY LADEN IN CLASS AND I'D RECOMMEND IT
FOR MORE INTUITIVE SR GR WITHOUT EM HARTLE GRAVITY

FOR A MATHEMATICAL TERSE SR EM GR LANDAU LIFSHITZ THE CLASSICAL THEORY OF FIELDS

TO BE HONEST I'M NOT REALLY SURE HOW LANDAU LIFSHITZ COVERS SO MUCH CONTENT IN SUCH A THIN BOOK BUT THEY DO AND QUITE WELL IF YOU CAN FOLLOW THEIR EXPLANATIONS
UHH WELL TALK ABOUT PROVIDENCE LOOK INTO THE CALCULATION FOR THE CRITICAL NUMBER OF DIMENSIONS NEEDED TO CANCEL ANOMALIES IN BOSONIC STRING THEORY WHICH HAPPENS TO BE I DON'T KNOW THE EQUATIONS MYSELF AND I AM SURE THEY ARE VERY COMPLICATED BUT IT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR MAYBE SOMEONE CAN POST IT FOR YOU OR YOU CAN FIND IT WITH A GOOGLE SEARCH


HAPPY X TH BIRTHDAY

I'M NOT A PHYSICS MAJOR

HERE IS A STACKEXCHANGE REQUEST FOR INTEGRALS THAT EVALUATE TO YOU CAN JUST TWEAK THE ANSWERS A LITTLE BIT TO MAKE THEM
CONTINUED FRACTION FOR SQRT PERHAPS
SOMETHING RELATED TO ELEMENT IRON

SOME MORE IDEAS
GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA JUST A DIFFERENT WAY TO EXPRESS THE SAME THINGS BUT IT LOOKS LIKE AN INTERESTING APPROACH
NICE ARTICLE
AT OXFORD THERE'S AN ENTRANCE EXAMINATION THE PAT WHICH COMBINED WITH THE INTERVIEW DETERMINES WHETHER YOU GET A PLACE FOR SCHOLARSHIPS LOOK AT
I WOULD GO FOR FIRST LAW THE IDEA THAT AN OBJECT WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE FOREVER IF NO FORCE ACTS ON IT

THERE IS A NICE THOUGHT EXPERIMENT I THINK GALILEI USED IT FIRST THAT EXPLAINS IT THE WIKIPEDIA PAGE ON INERTIA IS A GOOD START
I KNOW THIS DOESN'T QUITE ANSWER YOUR QUESTION BUT WHEN I WAS ABOUT I WAS FASCINATED BY THE UNCLE ALBERT BOOKS BY RUSSELL STANNARD WHICH TRIED TO INTRODUCE A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT CONCEPTS IN PHYSICS TO YOUNG PEOPLE WITHOUT MATHS INCLUDING SOME ASPECTS OF ADVANCED SUBJECTS LIKE RELATIVITY AND QUANTUM PHYSICS

I KNOW THE KIDS YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT ARE SLIGHTLY YOUNGER BUT I BELIEVE THE BOOKS ARE READ BY KIDS OF THAT AGE TOO ONCE THEY HAVE READ ONE OF THE MAIN ONES LIKE TIME AND SPACE OF UNCLE ALBERT THEY CAN ALSO CHECK OUT LETTERS TO UNCLE ALBERT WHICH ARE FILLED WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT PHYSICS AND SCIENCE SENT FROM CHILDREN TO THE ALBERT CHARACTER WITH HIS ANSWERS REALLY ANSWERS OF COURSE I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM
WHAT ARE SOME UNDERLYING CONCEPTS OF PHYSICS

THE IDEA THAT EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE BEHAVES IN A WAY THAT WE CAN DESCRIBE IT WITH A SMALL SET OF LAWS

AND WHILE THIS IS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE CHILDREN EDUCATION I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT IT WE HAVE A SET OF LAWS THAT DESCRIBES ALL PROPERTIES OF ALL PARTICLES RELEVANT FOR OUR LIFE WITHIN THE CURRENT EXPERIMENTAL PRECISION NO EXPERIMENT EVER PERFORMED FOUND A CLEAR DEVIATION AND IT'S NOT LIKE NO ONE WOULD HAVE TRIED THOUSANDS OF EXPERIMENTS HAVE BEEN PERFORMED TO TEST THE THEORIES WITH EVER INCREASING PRECISION SOME THINGS ARE MEASURED MORE PRECISELY THAN ONE PART IN A TRILLION

CONCERNING THE OTHER QUESTIONS LAWS CAN BE UNDERSTOOD WITHOUT FORMULAS AND DEMONSTRATED EASILY THEY ARE ALSO EASY TO LINK TO EVERYDAY LIFE
THIRD LAW BECAME HEAVILY ABUSED BY NEW AGE THINKERS TO GIVE BIRTH TO THE CONCEPT OF THE LAW OF ATTRACTION
ONE BOOK ON THE SUBJECT OF PHYSICS THAT I QUITE LIKED WHEN I WAS YOUNG WAS THE PHYSICS OF SUPERHEROES

IN IT THE AUTHOR LOOKS AT MANY DIFFERENT SUPER HEROES AND PROVIDES THEM WITH ONE MIRACLE EXCEPTION TO PHYSICS EAST G THE FLASH CAN RUN REALLY FAST SPIDERMAN CAN SOMEHOW PRODUCE SPIDER WEBS ETC AND THEN TALKS ABOUT THE PHYSICS INVOLVED WITH SOME OF THE ACTS PERFORMED BY THOSE HEROES
MY DAD IS A PHYSICIST BY PROFESSION SPECIALIZED IN OPTICS AND HE'S BEEN FULLY EMPLOYED SINCE HIS GRADUATION IT'S STILL A HIGHLY EXPANDING AREA LIMITED BY OUR MATERIALS SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY BUT THEY'RE GROWING SIDE-BY-SIDE AND STILL PUSHING NEW FRONTIERS ON A DAILY BASIS
PARTICLE ACCELERATORS FUSION PLASMA DETECTORS SENSORS SELF DRIVING CARS DRONES DEF ONE OF COOLEST AREAS

IT'S NOT ABOUT WHICH FIELDS OFFER THE MOST IT'S ABOUT WHERE YOU CAN APPLY YOURSELF BEST

THE EUV LITHOGRAPHY MACHINES THAT ASME ARE BUILDING ARE FULLY WORKING ON LASER AND PLASMA PHYSICS SO I THINK THERE WILL BE A LOT OF JOB OPPORTUNITIES THERE IN THE FUTURE FOR THE REST I THINK THAT A LOT OF PLASMA PHYSICS IS FOCUSED AT MAKING FUSION REACTORS AND A LOT OF MONEY IS PUT IN THAT FIELD
DELETED
WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH CONSTANT I'VE NEVER USED H INSTEAD OF BAR EXCEPT LIKE IN ONE UNDERGRAD LAB AND SOME EARLIER MEANINGLESS E HF CALCULATIONS IS IT JUST A HISTORICAL ACCIDENT THAT H GETS CALLED CONSTANT INSTEAD OF BAR
ARE THERE ANY ACTUALLY USEFUL APPLICATIONS OF ADS AFT TO CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT THE FIELD LOOKS LIKE IN ITS CURRENT STATE
DO YOU THINK THERE ARE ANY MORE BASIC SIMPLE LAWS THAT HAVE YET TO BE DISCOVERED OR HAVE WE PRETTY MUCH DISCOVERED EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE THAT'S LIKE THAT

EAST G F MA V IR PV NRA ETC
WHY ARE PHOTONS EMITTED WHEN ELECTRONS MOVE FROM HIGHER TO LOWER ENERGY LEVELS IS THERE A FUNDAMENTAL REASON WHY THE EXCESS ENERGY COULDN'T BE RELEASED AS SAY NEUTRINOS INSTEAD
WHY CAN'T WE CALCULATE SCHRDINGER EQUATION FOR MORE COMPLICATED ATOMS THAN HYDROGEN OR MOLECULES WHAT WOULD BE THE CONSEQUENCES IF WE COULD



TRYING TO TURN THE ACTION VARIABLE OF AN ELLIPTICAL ORBIT INTO THE AREA OF THE ORBIT QUESTION IS GIVEN IN X BUT I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE ORBIT PARAMETERS ENERGY TURNING POINTS ETC LOOK LIKE IN X COORDINATES EVERYWHERE I HAVE SEEN IT IN TERMS OF R IF ANYONE CAN HELP IT'D BE APPRECIATED
THE DAYTIME SIDE OF THE EARTH IS CLOSER TO THE SUN THAN THE NIGHTTIME SIDE IT IS THEREFORE EXPERIENCING MORE GRAVITY DOES THIS HAVE ANY NOTICEABLE EFFECT ON THE EARTH
IF TWO OBJECTS COLLIDE IN ZERO G VACUUM WHAT PRINCIPLE DETERMINES HOW THE LINEAR AND ANGULAR MOMENTA GET REDISTRIBUTED I EAST HOW MUCH GOES INTO SPINNING AND HOW MUCH GOES INTO KNOCKING IS IT NET CONSERVED LINEAR AND ANGULAR MOMENTA OF THE COMBINED SYSTEM
ALONG THE SAME LINE OF THOUGHT THAT THE LENGTH OF AN OBJECT PARALLEL TO THE DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT SHORTENS AS U COUNTY

IS IT FLAWED LOGIC TO ASSOCIATE THAT TO THE EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE

COULD THE EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE BE CAUSE BY THE UNIVERSE AS A WHOLE SLOWING DOWN AS SEEN FROM A DIFFERENT REFERENCE FRAME

AND WOULD AN OBJECT APPEAR 2 DIMENSIONAL IF IT WAS ABLE TO REACH THE SPEED OF LIGHT

AM I JUST STUPID AND HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I AM EVEN ASKING
DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY GOOD RECENT RESOURCES ON FORMATION AND EVOLUTION OF COSMIC STRING NETWORKS IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYTHING I CAN FIND IS FROM THE S WORK BY KIBBLE HUROK VILENKIN ETC AND WHILE IT CERTAINLY SEEMS LIKE GOOD WORK I'M JUST WONDERING IF THERE HAVE BEEN ANY ADVANCES IN THE FIELD PERHAPS A GOOD REVIEW ARTICLE
CAN'T WE MEASURE STUFF WITH SOMETHING ELSE OTHER THAN ELECTRONS WHY DON'T WE MAKE INSTRUMENTS THAT MEASURE INTERACTION VIA STRONG OR WEAK FORCE FOR EXAMPLE WILL THE RECENT DISCOVERY OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES HELP US UNLOCK THE MYSTERIES OF QUANTUM PHYSICS
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND ABOUT QUANTUM FIELD THEORY THE WAVES IN THE QUANTUM FIELD NOT SURE WHAT THE ACTUAL NAME IS OSCILLATE BACK AND FORTH AND IF THEY REACH A CERTAIN AMPLITUDE A PARTICLE IS BORN SO WHEN IT TALKS ABOUT REACHING A CERTAIN AMPLITUDE IS THIS REACHED BY CONSTRUCTIVE INTERFERENCE BETWEEN THE WAVES OR DO THE WAVES NOT INTERFERE AT ALL AND PARTICLES KEEP POPPING BACK INTO EXISTENCE ONCE PER PERIOD ALSO COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT ANTI PARTICLES COULD JUST BE NEGATIVE DISPLACEMENTS
HOW CAN LIGHT CARRY MOMENTUM IF MV THEN BOTH MASS AND VELOCITY ARE REQUIRED SO HOW CAN A PARTICLE THAT TRAVELS AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT WITH ZERO MASS THE PHOTON CARRY MOMENTUM

I DOUBLE MAJORED IN PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY IN UNDERGRAD I DIDN'T TAKE THE ASTRONOMY ASTROPHYSICS UNITS THOUGH BECAUSE THAT'S A DIFFERENT MAJOR AT MY UNI FROM WHAT I CAN TELL AS A PHYSICS GRAD THERE ARE TWO OPTIONS CODING THEORETICAL OR INSTRUMENTATION EXPERIMENTAL

I HAVE WORKED AS AN INSTRUMENTAL PHYSICIST IN BOTH COMMERCIAL AND RESEARCH LABS I FOUND THIS TO BE VERY REWARDING AS THE FEEDBACK ON YOUR WORK IS CLOSE TO INSTANTANEOUS AND FUNDING FOR YOUR POSITION AND YOUR WORK IS PRETTY SOLID BECAUSE THEY WON'T HIRE YOU IF THEY DON'T NEED YOU I AM NOW DOING MY PHD IN APPLIED PHYSICS AND IN SOME WAYS IT'S MUCH HARDER WITHOUT THOSE INSTANT RESULTS THERE'S A LOT OF WAITING AND BANGING YOUR HEAD AGAINST A WALL PARTICULARLY WITH THE CODING PORTION IT'S AWESOME WHEN YOU GET IT TO WORK THOUGH

STRANGELY THE THEORETICAL SIDE OF PHYSICS IS WHERE ALL THE MONEY IS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH IN MY COUNTRY THAT'S ON YOUR SIDE FOR ASTRONOMY THOUGH BECAUSE THAT'S MOSTLY COMPUTATIONAL BASED FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN

I DON'T HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE WITH AERONAUTICS BUT FEEL FREE TO ASK ME ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ABOUT A BASE PHYSICS PROGRAM
DETERMINE IF YOUR INTEREST IN PHYSICS ASTROPHYSICS IS MORE OF A HOBBY OR A LIFELONG PASSION I THOUGHT ASTROPHYSICS WAS MY PASSION STARTING MY PHYSICS B SOUTH AND NOW THAT I HAVE TAKEN MY ASTRO COURSES AND AM GRADUATING IN A FEW MONTHS I WISH I MAJORED IN ENGINEERING I WANT A JOB WITHOUT HAVING TO DO MORE YEARS OF SCHOOL
PROFESSIONAL ASTROPHYSICIST HERE

A CAREER AS A RESEARCH SCIENTIST EITHER AT A UNIVERSITY OR A RESEARCH INSTITUTE INVOLVES NOT ONLY A BACHELORS MASTERS AND PHD BUT INVOLVES LOVING THE DOCTORATE SO MUCH THAT YOU EFFECTIVELY JUST KEEP ON DOING DOCTORATES OVER AND OVER AGAIN OF COURSE ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR PHD YOU DON'T NEED TO DO ANOTHER ONE BUT POST DOCS AND RESEARCH POSITIONS ARE THE SAME BREAD AND BUTTER AS A PHD YOU JUST DO IT FASTER AND BETTER AS YOU BECOME MORE EXPERIENCED

THERE ARE LOADS OF CAREERS THAT LIKE ASTROPHYSICS PHS OUR STUDENTS ARE VERY EMPLOYABLE OFTEN IN HIGHLY PAID JOBS MUCH HIGHER PAID THAN RESEARCH FROM METEOROLOGY AND DATA SCIENCE TO CODING AND SUPER COMPUTING FROM COMPUTER MODELING AND VISUALIZATIONS TO BUSINESS CONSULTING AND QUANTS EVERYONE WANTS A NUMBER GUY WHO KNOWS STATISTICS AND MODELING AS WELL AS PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND SOME OF THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF MATHEMATICAL ACUMEN IN SOCIETY
YOU'LL ONLY GET WORK IF YOU GET A PHD SO FOCUS ON THAT FIRST
ERIN
INTERESTING TYPO
THIS IS CERTAINLY ALL TRUE BUT SO IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN TELLING PEOPLE WHO ASK ME THIS FOR YEARS WHICH IS JUST THAT THE 2ND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS ONLY APPLIES TO OPEN SYSTEMS AND IN MORE DETAIL THAT OPEN SYSTEMS THAT CAN BE WORKED ON BY OTHER SYSTEMS WILL OFTEN EXPERIENCE A REDUCTION IN ENTROPY LIFE OR NO LIFE AND SO ON

LIKE BOOKS YOU WOULD READ WHEN TAKING A COURSE AT COLLEGE

LECTURES ARE VERY NICE BUT THEY'RE NOT AT ALL AT THE LEVEL OF AN UNDERGRADUATE COURSE ON THE SAME TOPIC IF I RECALK SUSSKIND TRIES TO KEEP EVERYTHING CONFINED TO ALGEBRA AND SIMPLE CALCULUS AND MAKES NO ATTEMPT TO TEACH PROBLEM SOLVING ABILITY CONVERSELY A UNIVERSITY BOOK LIKE ANY OF BOOKS IS INTENDED TO MAKE SURE THE STUDENT CAN SOLVE PROBLEMS

WITH THAT IN MIND LECTURE S MIGHT BE A GOOD FIT IF YOU'RE KEEPING UP WITH STUFF
THERE'S A MISLEADING PART WITH THE SOCCER BALL PHOTON EXPLANATION YOU'D STILL SEE A DIFFRACTION PATTERN WITH ONLY ONE SLIT USING PHOTONS AS LONG AS THE SLIT IS SMALL ENOUGH
THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD YOU COVERED A LOT OF GROUND GOOD JOB
I RECOMMEND AGAINST READ AND HIGHLIGHT YOU DON'T HIGHLIGHT IMPORTANT STUFF IN PHYSICS TEXTBOOKS IT'S ALL IMPORTANT FACTS THE DENSITY OF INFORMATION IS VERY HIGH

YOU SHOULD READ AND WORK THROUGH EACH CHAPTER TRYING TO FOLLOW THE INDIVIDUAL STEPS SAY BY DOING THEM ON A BLANK SHEET OF PAPER AND DOING THE EXERCISES AT THE END OF THE CHAPTER

YOU SHOULD ALSO DO A SUMMARY AT THE END OF A CHAPTER THE CORE CONCEPTS THAT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED IN THE CHAPTER IMPORTANT CALCULATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE IMPORTANT FACTS THAT HAVE BEEN DERIVED FROM THE THEORY BASIC ASSUMPTIONS OF MODELS

IF THEY ARE YOUR BOOKS YOU CAN ADD NOTES INTO THE BOOKS SOME THOUGHTS THAT YOU CAME UP WITH WHILE TRYING TO FOLLOW THE STEPS SO IF YOU REREAD IT YOU HAVE IT THERE
BY JUST READING IT AND PROBABLY HIGHLIGHT SOME IMPORTANT PARTS

NUMBER YOU WILL NEVER LEARN PHYSICS LIKE THIS READ THE CHAPTERS AND THEN DO EVERY SINGLE PRACTICE PROBLEM AT THE BACK PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU LEARN YOU MAY READ A CHAPTER AND THINK OK I GOT THAT BUT IT WON'T STICK AND WHEN YOU NEED TO USE IT YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO

IN ADDITION I DO FIND WRITING OUT MY OWN SET OF NOTES THAT TRY AND EXPLAIN THE CONCEPTS TO A FICTITIOUS THIRD PARTY TO BE VERY HELPFUL FOR MY UNDERSTANDING

FILTERS THAT ALLOW A NARROW BAND OF WAVELENGTH TO PASS ARE CALLED BANDPASS FILTERS

EG
EDMUND OPTICS HAS SOME REAL DEEP UV BANDPASS FILTERS SEEMS TO BE MADE OF MF 2 AND FUSED SILICA

IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ANYTHING BROADBAND LIKE NM BANDPASS FILTERS YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY NOT GOING TO FIND THEM UNLESS YOU KNOW LITHOGRAPHY AND CAN FABRICATE A STRUCTURE YOURSELF THAT'LL ALLOW FOR STRONG UV TRANSMITTANCE
EVERYTHING HERE SEEMS PRETTY STANDARD EXCEPT FOR THAT TWO PHOTON ABSORPTION BUSINESS I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THE ABSORPTION RATE WOULD BE PROHIBITIVELY LOW FOR THIS TO WORK PRETTY COOL STUFF
FOUND THIS AMAZING SERIES AND JUST REALLY WANTED TO SHARE IT THIS GUY IS SO INCREDIBLY LUCID AND CLEAR
AWESOME AS AN UNDERGRAD WITH AN INTEREST TO PURSUE RESEARCH IN QUANTUM COMPUTATION THIS WILL SURELY HELP ME LEARN MORE ABOUT THE THEORY THANKS FOR SHARING
HIS BOOK FABRIC OF REALITY DISCUSSES THIS AMONG OTHER THINGS STRONGLY RECOMMEND IT IF YOU FIND THESE TALKS INTERESTING
OME HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF YOUTUBE IT WORKS VERY WELL ON ALL KINDS OF DEVICES
WORKING ON PASSING MY PHYSICS CLASSICAL
CONQUERING THE PHYSICS GRE AND CRIPPLING SELF-DOUBT
WORKING ON A NEW EXPERIMENT WE'RE HOPING TO SHOWCASE A NEW TECHNIQUE FOR IMPROVING THE FIDELITY QUALITY OF ENTANGLEMENT GATES BETWEEN TWO IONS
WORKING ON A RESEARCH POSTER IT'S GOING ALRIGHT
TRYING TO PYTHON UP AN AUTOMATIC FITTING PROGRAM TO GIVE LIVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF MY EXPERIMENT
MAKING THE PLOTS LOOK PRETTY
WORKING ON DEVELOPING RELATIONSHIPS WITH MY CC PROFESSORS SO I CAN MAYBE GET A RECOMMENDATION FOR AN INTERNSHIP OVER THE SUMMER ADVICE


HOWEVER IF I DON'T GET AN INTERNSHIP I'M GOING TO BACKPACK ACROSS THE US BECAUSE WHY NOT
I'M REVIEWING FOR THE GENERAL GRE THAT I'M TAKING LATER THIS WEEK I ALSO HAVE TO STUDY MORE FOR THE PHYSICS GRE FINISH HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS WRITE A POSTER APPLY TO TRAVEL GRANTS FOR A CONFERENCE STUDY FOR AN UPCOMING AMII TEST AND ALSO DO MY RESEARCH AND APPLY TO GRAD PROGRAMS

I FEEL LIKE I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THIS EVEN THOUGH EVIDENCE SAYS OTHERWISE I ALSO HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO SEE MY BEST FRIENDS IN OVER A MONTH I JUST FEEL A LITTLE OVERWHELMED AT THE MOMENT NO MATTER HOW MUCH I DO I STILL HAVE MORE THINGS TO DO

THANKS FOR READING MY RANT
JUST FINISHED RESPONDING TO A COMMENTS ON WHAT WILL SOON BE MY FIRST PUBLICATION ABOUT TO START LOOKING INTO UNDERGRAD RESEARCH INTERNSHIPS I CAN GET OVER THE SUMMER PROBABLY THROUGH SPS
I'LL ADMIT UP FRONT I'M NOT TOO FAMILIAR WITH KHAN ACADEMY BUT ON THE FEW OCCASIONS I'VE STUMBLED ONTO LECTURES ON YOUTUBE IT SEEMED VERY MUCH LIKE A KIMON TYPE DEAL I EAST EMPHASIS ON WROTE REPETITION INSTEAD OF CONCEPTS AND UNDERSTANDING THUS IT SEEMS MORE AIMED AT MAKING SOMEONE WHO DOES WELL AT SOLVING HOMEWORK PROBLEMS AND THUS DOING WELL IN A COURSE

IF YOUR INTEREST IS MORE OF A HOBBY THIS IS PROBABLY NOT WHAT YOU REALLY WANT DO YOU HAVE ANY MATH BACKGROUND PEOPLE SEEM TO LIKE LEONARD THEORETICAL MINIMUM LECTURES
I'LL MENTION THE MECHANICAL UNIVERSE PRIMARILY FOR THE REASON THAT ITS LEVEL OF AWESOMENESS IS DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE LEVEL OF POPULARITY IT IS RARELY EVER MENTIONED
I'VE NEVER BEEN REALLY INTO THE WHOLE VIDEO LECTURE THING SO I CAN'T ADVISE YOU THERE BUT FEYNMAN LECTURES ARE FREE ONLINE AND ARE VERY INTERESTING THEY ARE NOT IN MY OPINION A GREAT FIRST TEXT AND ARE MUCH BETTER TO READ AFTER YOU HAVE SOME BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE MATERIAL AS TAKE ON SUBJECTS IS SOMETIMES UNORTHODOX AND LEADS TO MANY EUREKA MOMENTS IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING PHYSICS WELL BUT ARE JUST CONFUSING IF YOU DON'T ALREADY UNDERSTAND AT LEAST SOMEWHAT
EVERYONE LEARNS IN DIFFERENT WAYS FOR ME VIDEO LECTURES WERE ONLY HELPFUL IN CLARIFYING CONCEPTS I WAS CONFUSED ABOUT FOR ACTUALLY LEARNING THE MATERIAL I ALWAYS FOUND READING ABOUT THE CONCEPTS THEN SOLVING PROBLEMS TO BE THE BEST TACTIC THAT MIGHT NOT BE THE CASE FOR YOU AND YOU MAY HAVE TO TRY A FEW DIFFERENT APPROACHES UNTIL YOU FIND ONE YOU LIKE

IF YOU ARE LIKE ME AND LEARN BEST BY SOLVING PROBLEMS THEN I WOULD SUGGEST JUST GOING OUT AND BUYING A PHYSICS TEXTBOOK OR A REVIEW BOOK I NEVER TOOK AP PHYSICS C BUT IN MY SENIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL I WOULD TRY TO SPEND SOME TIME EVERY DAY GOING THROUGH THE REVIEW BOOK FOR IT THAT I BOUGHT

BEST OF LUCK

PAGE SOUTH EVERYONE ON THIS FORUM IS GOING TO RECOMMEND YOU THE FEYNMAN LECTURES ON PHYSICS THEY ARE DEFINITELY WORTH BUYING AND ARE BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN AND PRESENTED HOWEVER I DID NOT FIND THEM TO BE A GREAT INTRODUCTORY RESOURCE WAIT UNTIL YOU ARE SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR WITH THE CONCEPTS IN THE BOOK THEN READ ABOUT THEM FOR A MORE INTUITIVE UNDERSTANDING
REMOVED
YEP SOUND EXPERIMENTAL THINKING AND APPARATUS RIGHT UP UNTIL THAT
IN MAY NEW ITER CHIEF BERNARD BIGOT FORMER HEAD OF FRENCH NUCLEAR STATE AGENCY CERAGO

FOR SAKE I HOPE ITER NEVER HAS ANY SORT OF DISCRIMINATION SCANDAL THE HEADLINES REALLY WRITE THEMSELVES

BILLION EUROS IS STILL A LOT LESS THAN GERMANY ALONE SPEND FOR SOLAR SUBSIDIES SO THE PRICE SHOULDN'T BE MENTIONED AT ALL BUT EVEN WITH THE WENDELSTEIN X WHICH COST BILLION EUROS OVER YEARS SOME GREENS HAVE COME FORWARD QUOTING ITS IMMENSE PRICE
WHAT A BOONDOGGLE

POLITICS HAS MADE THIS PROJECT A FUCKING JOKE
FOR THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE A RELIABLE ESTIMATE IN THE PAST THERE WAS NO REALISTIC SCHEDULE NO DETAILED APPRECIATION OF THE COST SAID BIGOT

IF THE PARTNER COUNTRIES FUNDED THE PROJECT WITH BILLIONS OF EUROS AND NO REALISTIC SCHEDULE OR COST ANALYSIS YEARS AGO THEN WE SHOULD ALL DOUBT THEY HAVE A RELIABLE ESTIMATE TODAY

BUT MAYBE I'M TOO CYNICAL
I WASN'T AWARE ANYONE WAS STILL TRYING FOR A LARGE-SCALE TOKAMAK REACTOR ISN'T THE STELLARATOR DESIGN SUPPOSED TO BE A MUCH MORE PROMISING RESEARCH AVENUE
ITER WAS A FUCKING DISASTER FROM THE GET GO IT'S SUCH A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY THERE ARE BETTER IDEAS AROUND THAT COST FAR LESS AND DON'T NEED A TON OF DIFFERENT COUNTRIES TO COOPERATE TO BUILDING
DOES ANYONE ELSE FIND IT STRANGE THAT THEY'RE BUILDING THIS IN SOUTH FRANCE BUT FRANCE ISN'T ONE OF THE PARTNERS
OH YEAH IT'S THAT ARTICLE

IT'S A DISASTER AND SHOULDN'T EVEN HAVE PUBLISHED THE JOURNAL RIGHTFULLY BACKTRACKED BECAUSE THEY REALIZED THEY MADE AN OBVIOUS MISTAKE PUBLISHING IT THEY VERY LIKELY WERE CONFUSED BY THE COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY GENERAL RELATIVISTIC SMOKE SCREEN AT THE HEART OF THIS IS A REALLY ELEMENTARY MISTAKE THE AUTHOR IS TAKING YEARS TO RECOGNIZE AS SUCH

LUBOW MOTL IS PRETTY MUCH SPOT ON ABOUT THIS BTW BUT SINCE HE'S A NAZI DOUCHE I WON'T LINK TO HIS BLOG

WHILE I AGREE SOMETIMES THE STANDARDS FOR PEER REVIEW ARE SUBOPTIMAL EXPECTING NO MISTAKES TO BE EVER MADE IS UNREALISTIC ONE SHOULD ALWAYS KEEP IN MIND THE SHEER AMOUNT OF CRACKPOT OR SIMPLY WRONG PAPERS THAT ARE SUCCESSFULLY BLOCKED BY THE SYSTEM SO AS TO PLACE THIS KIND OF CASES IN PERSPECTIVE
AFTER OUR EDITORIAL MEETING WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT YOUR RESULT IS IN OBVIOUS CONFLICT WITH A PROVEN SCIENTIFIC FACT I EAST VIOLATION OF LOCAL REALISM THAT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED NOT ONLY THEORETICALLY BUT EXPERIMENTALLY IN RECENT EXPERIMENTS AND THUS YOUR RESULT COULD NOT BE GENERALLY ACCEPTED BY THE PHYSICS COMMUNITY ON THIS BASIS WE HAVE MADE SUCH A DECISION TO WITHDRAW YOUR PAPER

I WAS A BIT CONFUSED BY THE DOUBLE NEGATIVE HERE BUT IF DID I UNDERSTAND IT CORRECTLY THAT IF THIS REVIEW STATEMENT IS TRUE THEN THIS PAPER WOULD IMPLY LOCAL REALISM AND BASED ON THE LINKED RUBBERER THREADS THE PAPER IS QUITE OPEN ABOUT DISPROVING BELL'S THEOREM AND CONTAINS ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICAL MISTAKES HOW DID THAT GET PUBLISHED IN THE FIRST PLACE WHAT KIND OF A REVIEWER WOULDN'T REQUIRE THIS KIND OF PAPER TO BE OF VERY HIGH STANDARD AND VERY EXPLICIT ABOUT ITS CONSEQUENCES DOUBLE CHECK THE MATHEMATICS SMELLS FISHY

IF THIS IS INDEED THE CASE SOME SERIOUS ERRORS HAVE HAPPENED IN THE PEER REVIEW PROCESS AND I DO AGREE WITH RETRACTING THIS PAPER BUT OBVIOUSLY THE AUTHOR SHOULD BE ALERTED OF THIS BEFOREHAND AND THE RETRACTION SHOULD BE DONE AND EXPLAINED MORE CAREFULLY
THE EINSTEIN CENTRE FOR PHYSICS IN OXFORD UK SOUNDS LIKE IT IS FRINGE



THESE PUBLISHERS PROVIDE EXTREMELY LITTLE UTILITY TO THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY WHILE SIPHONING AWAY BUCKETS OF CASH
I HAVE NEVER SUBMITTED A PAPER TO AN ELSEVIER JOURNAL BUT I GET THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY DON'T HAVE A VERY RIGOROUS PEER REVIEW PROCESS
DELETED
WHAT EXACTLY IS SPIN AT THE QUANTUM LEVEL THE ARTICLE SAYS

SO IN QUANTUM PHYSICS THERE IS A RELATED NOTION AND THAT GOES BY
THE NAME OF SPIN EXCEPT THAT IN QUANTUM PHYSICS SPIN IS FIXED TO A
PARTICULAR VALUE

DOES THE PARTICLE ACTUALLY ROTATE ARE THE ROTATIONAL POSITIONS QUANTIZED ARE THE DIFFERENT SPIN NUMBERS RELATED TO THE SPEED OF ROTATION IF THE SPIN IS DOES THE PARTICLE SNAP TO ITS NEXT POSITION DEGREES FROM ITS CURRENT POSITION HOW WOULD YOU DETECT ANY ROTATION AT ALL IN THIS CASE

IF SPIN HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PARTICLE ROTATION THEN WHAT EXACTLY IS ITS PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION

NOTE THAT I HAVE NO PROBLEM UNDERSTANDING ROTATION IN MORE THAN PHYSICAL DIMENSION
HAVE YOU CONTACT THE PHYSICS DEPARTMENT OF YOUR LOCAL UNIVERSITY THEY USUALLY HAVE SOMEBODY WHO CAN HELP WITH THESE KIND OF THINGS WHEN IT IS FOR HIGH SCHOOL WHICH I ASSUME THEY'RE USUALLY ABLE TO HELP
CAN YOU SAY A BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT YOU ACTUALLY NEED TO DEMONSTRATE LIKE DO YOU HAVE A MATERIAL YOU WANT TO SEE AN ACE IN OR DO YOU NEED TO BUILD SOME SORT OF ACTUAL DEVICE WHAT EQUIPMENT AND OR FACILITIES DO YOU HAVE ACCESS TO
THE DERIVATIVE CAN HAVE DISCONTINUITIES IF THE POTENTIAL HAS DIRAC DELTAS FOR EXAMPLE IT'S EASY TO SEE FROM EQUATION IF THE POTENTIAL HAS A DIRAC THEN SO DOES THE SECOND DERIVATIVE OF THE WAVEFUNCTION AND HENCE THE FIRST DERIVATIVE MUST HAVE A DISCONTINUITY

HOWEVER YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT CHANGING THE SIGN AT A NODE IN WHICH CASE YOU'RE ASSUMING THAT WE'RE AT A POINT WHERE THE WAVEFUNCTION IS ZERO IN THIS SPECIAL CASE IT TURNS OUT THAT THE DERIVATIVE MUST BE CONTINUOUS EVEN AT A DIRAC DELTA MORE PRECISELY THE DISCONTINUITY OF THE DERIVATIVE AT A DELTA FUNCTION IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE VALUE OF THE WAVEFUNCTION THERE SO IF THE VALUE IS ZERO SO IS THE DISCONTINUITY

IN MORE REGULAR POTENTIALS WITH NO DIRAC HARD WALLS AND SO ON THE DERIVATIVE MUST BE CONTINUOUS IT CAN BE SEEN FROM THE SCHRDINGER EQUATION AND THINKING ABOUT HOW EACH TERMS WAVEFUNCTION ITS SECOND DERIVATIVE AND THE POTENTIAL MUST FIT TOGETHER FOR REGULARITY
THE ANSWER YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IS A MATHEMATICAL ONE A WAVE FUNCTION IS A SOLUTION TO A SECOND ORDER DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION

A FUNCTION THAT HAS THE SAME SIGN ON BOTH SIDES OF THE NODES NECESSARILY HAS A VANISHING DERIVATIVE THEREIN

NOW THE NODE IS A ZERO OF THE WAVEFUNCTION AND HENCE THE WAVEFUNCTION AS WELL AS ITS DERIVATIVE THEN WOULD VANISH AT THE NODE

BEING THE SOLUTION TO A SECOND ORDER DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION MEANS THE SOLUTION IS UNIQUE IF YOU FIX THE VALUE OF THE FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE VALUE OF ITS DERIVATIVE AT A SINGLE POINT

NOW THERE IS A SOLUTION WITH F NODE F NODE IT IS F X FOR ALL X UNIQUENESS THEN IMPLIES THAT YOUR WAVEFUNCTION MUST BE ZERO ALREADY HENCE A NON ZERO WAVEFUNCTION MUST CHANGE SIGN AT A NODE
MY GUT FEELING TELLS ME IT IS A CONSEQUENCE OF SMOOTHNESS OF WAVEFUNCTIONS I REMEMBER THAT THE FIRST FEW DERIVATIVES MUST BE SMOOTH FOR A WAVEFUNCTION TO BE A SOLUTION TO A WAVE EQUATION
THINK THE TIME DEPENDENT SCHRDINGER EQUATION CAN BE INTERPRETED AS SUCH BUT TAKE IT WITH A LOT OF SALT I AM NOT A THEORETICIAN
YOU DIDN'T SAY ENERGY EIGENSTATE SO LONG AS YOU CAN DECOMPOSE IT INTO A BASIS OF ENERGY EIGENSTATE YOU CAN HAVE ANY WAVEFUNCTION YOU CARE TO DRAW
THE ENERGY OF LIGHT IS TIED TO THE FREQUENCY AND ENERGY MUST BE CONSERVED SO THERE ARE LIMITED SHIFTS THAT CAN HAPPEN

PHOTON UNCONVERSION INVOLVES THE ABSORPTION OF TWO PHOTONS THEN A PHOTON WITH A FREQUENCY EQUAL TO THE SUM OF THE ABSORBED PHOTON FREQUENCIES IS EMITTED

SOMETHING SIMILAR CAN HAPPEN WITH SPONTANEOUS PARAMETRIC A PHOTON CAN BE ESSENTIALLY SPLIT BY A MATERIAL INTO TWO PHOTONS WHOSE ENERGIES ADD UP TO THE INCIDENT PHOTON IT'S INTERESTING THAT YOU MENTIONED KEEPING THE MOMENTUM OF THE PHOTONS BECAUSE BOTH ENERGY AN MOMENTUM HAVE TO BE CONSERVED PHOTONS DEPART AT AN ANGLE FROM CALCULATING THE ANGLES RELATIVE TO THE INCIDENT CATCHLINE AS A FUNCTION OF THE RATIO OF ENERGIES MAKES FOR A GOOD HOMEWORK PROBLEM

THE MOST BROAD PHENOMENON IS FLUORESCENCE THERE'S ALL SORTS OF INTERESTING BEHAVIOR THERE FLUORESCENCE ALLOWS THE CONSTRUCTION OF LASERS AT A MUCH BROADER RANGE OF FREQUENCIES THAN LASING MEDIUMS WOULD ALLOW READ UP ON DYE LASERS
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF NONLINEAR OPTICAL EFFECTS THAT CAN BE USED TO BROADEN AND COMPRESS THE BANDWIDTH OF A LASER PULSE MODULATION ETC THERE ARE ALSO NONLINEAR OPTICAL EFFECTS THAT CAN BE USED TO SHIFT THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM OF LIGHT TO A NEW FREQUENCY ALTOGETHER NONLINEAR OPTICAL HARMONIC GENERATION AND PARAMETRIC AMPLIFICATION THESE PROCESSES TYPICALLY REQUIRE THAT THE LIGHT BE VERY INTENSE I EAST AN ULTRASHORT LASER PULSE WITH INTENSITIES GW CM 2 THERE IS A WHOLE FIELD OF RESEARCH HOWEVER DEVOTED TO DEVELOPING MATERIALS THAT EXHIBIT NONLINEAR OPTICAL EFFECTS WITH LOW LIGHT INTENSITY AS WELL TOWARDS SINGLE PHOTON NONLINEAR OPTICS

OF COURSE A SIMPLE FILTER OR COMBINATION OF FILTERS IS A REALLY GREAT WAY TO SHRINK A SPECTRUM OF LIGHT A GOOD EXAMPLE IS TINTED SUNGLASSES
A MATERIAL THAT COULD TAKEN IN LIGHT AT A CERTAIN ENERGY LEVEL ALTER IT AND THEN EMIT IT IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS IT APPROACHED

SOME MATERIALS CAN DOUBLE THE FREQUENCY OF THE LIGHT PASSING THROUGH THEM FOR EXAMPLE THIS IS HOW GREEN LASER POINTERS WORK TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION

THE EFFECT CAN BE GOTTEN ONLY UNDER VERY SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES IT DOESN'T WORK FOR A WIDE RANGE OF WAVELENGTHS OR IF AN OPTICALLY COHERENT WAVEFRONT IS REQUIRED
I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT OPTICS AND THIS SORT OF THING TO SAY IT IS POSSIBLE OR NOT BUT I AM FAIRLY CONFIDENT EVERYTHING WOULD LOOKS THE SAME PRETTY MUCH
TURNS OUT IT MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN JUST ANGULAR MOMENTUM CONSERVATION MOSTLY WE DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW IT WORKS

WATCH V ODAC

I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT ABOUT IT THIS WAY WHEN THE BIKE IS STILL AS YOU LOOSE YOUR BALANCE WHERE DOES THE FRONT WHEEL GO NO WHERE NOTHING COMPENSATES THE FORCE OF GRAVITY PULLING YOU DOWN

WHEN YOU ARE MOVING AND YOU START TO LOOSE YOUR BALANCE WHERE DOES THE FRONT WHEEL GO YOU INSTINCTIVELY TURN IT SLIGHTLY THIS EFFECTIVELY COMPENSATES FOR THE FORCE OF GRAVITY PULLING YOU DOWN HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT WHEN YOU ARE TURNING ON A BIKE YOU LEAN THIS MEANS THAT THROUGHOUT THE TURN THE FORCE THAT THE GROUND IS EXERTING ON THE WHEELS IS CREATING A CENTRIPETAL ACCELERATION THAT IS BOTH CHANGING YOUR DIRECTION AND FIGHTING THE FORCE OF GRAVITY THAT IS PULLING YOU DOWN

BASICALLY I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF IT THAT THE FORCE OF GRAVITY THAT PULLS YOU DOWN IS COMPENSATED FOR BY THE CENTRIPETAL ACCELERATION WHEN YOU TURN A MOIG BICYCLE OFFERS A MEANS OF CORRECTING BALANCE THAT A STATIONARY BICYCLE DOES NOT

NOTICE HOW WHEN YOH ARE BARELY MOVING AND TRYING TO BALANCE YOUR TURNS GET MORE EXTREME THIS IS BECAUSE AT SLOWER SPEEDS MORE EXTREME TURNS ARE REQUIRED TO GENERATE THE NECESSARY COUNTERACTING CENTRIPETAL ACCELERATION

EDIT LEANING INTO THE TURN HELPS CHANNEL SOME OF THE FORCE THE GROUND IS EXERTING ON THE WHEELS IN A TURN TO FIGHTING GRAVITY
IT HAS TO DO WITH CONSERVATION OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM


EVEN AS AN UNDERGRAD PHYSICS STUDENT YOU WILL HAVE TO WRITE PAPERS DOCUMENTING EXPERIMENTS DONE IN YOUR LAB CLASSES IF YOU WANT TO BE A PHYSICIST YOU'LL NEED A PHD WHICH MEANS YOU'LL HAVE TO WRITE A THESIS WHICH ARE COMMONLY HUNDREDS OF PAGES LONG AND THAT'S NOT COUNTING THE PAPERS YOU'LL BE REQUIRED TO PUBLISH OR THE GRANT PROPOSALS AS YOU MENTION YOU HAVE TO WRITE TO GET FUNDING ALL OF THIS ONLY CONTINUES IF YOU BECOME A PROFESSOR A HUGE PART OF DOING SCIENCE IS PARTICIPATING IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AND YOU CAN'T DO THAT IF YOU CAN'T WRITE TO EXPRESS YOUR IDEAS AND EXPERIMENTS

I FOUND GROWING UP THAT I ALSO HATED WRITING BOOK REPORTS I THOUGHT I HATED WRITING TOO BUT IT TURNS OUT I JUST HATED WRITING ABOUT BOOKS WHEN I GOT THE CHANCE TO WRITE ABOUT SCIENCE I LOVED IT YOU MAY FIND THE SAME IS TRUE FOR YOU WRITING IS JUST A WAY OF COMMUNICATING DON'T GIVE UP ON IT YET
IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT WRITING ESSAYS IS DIFFERENT TO WRITING REPORTS THESES WHILE THERE ARE SOME SIMILARITIES I FIND WRITING REPORTS MORE INTERESTING
THERE IS A LOT OF WRITING BUT DON'T DESPAIR

I ALSO REALLY HATED WRITING ESSAYS FOR BOOKS IN ENGLISH CLASS TECHNICAL WRITING IS NOT THE SAME THING YOU NEED SOME OF THE BASIC SKILLS LIKE NARRATIVE FLOW ORGANIZATION AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO DON'T IGNORE ENGLISH CLASS BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO BE SUBJECTIVE VAGUE OR FILL UP A PAGE TO GET THE LENGTH REQUIRED FOR AN ASSIGNMENT

INSTEAD YOU GET TO WRITE WHAT YOU WANT AS ELOQUENTLY AND SUCCINCTLY AS YOU CAN WHILE DOING AWESOME SCIENCE

REMEMBER MOST RESEARCH IS PAID FOR BY PUBLIC FUNDING IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER THIS MEANS YOU OR SOMEONE ON YOUR BEHALF NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE TO THE PUBLIC OR JUST LESS TECHNICAL PEOPLE THAN YOU IN ORDER TO CONTINUE YOUR WORK HANG IN THERE
IS THIS TRUE THAT THERE IS A LOT OF WRITING IN PHYSICS OR IS IT FALSE

TRUE BUT THE WRITING IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING LIKE THE BOOK REPORTS AND FIVE PARAGRAPH ESSAYS THEY MAKE YOU WRITE IN HIGH SCHOOL AND BEFORE THERE ARE SELDOM MANDATORY WORD COUNTS OR PAGE LENGTHS AND YOU DON'T NEED TO AND IT'S TYPICALLY ACTIVELY DISCOURAGED ADD VAGUE FLUFF TO MAKE YOUR WORK A CERTAIN LENGTH CONCISION IS DESIRED RAMBLING IS NOT
I WORKED IN COMMERCIAL SCIENCE FOR MANY YEARS EVEN THOUGH WE WERE DOING FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH ORGANIC PHOTOVOLTAICS WE SPEND OUR TIME CONDUCTING EXPERIMENTS AND TEST BUILDING AND DESIGNING INSTRUMENTS WRITING SOFTWARE DESIGNING ELECTRONICS MEETINGS AND YES SOMETIMES WRITING PAPERS REPORTS RESULT ANALYSIS PATENT APPLICATIONS

THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE ACADEMIC ROUTE WHERE YOU HAVE PRESSURES TO PUBLISH PUBLISH OR PERISH AND HUNTING FOR TENURE OR YOUR NEXT GRANT I WOULD SAY THERE ARE FAR MORE PEOPLE WITH PHYSICS DEGREES OR WORKING IN SCIENCE FOR INDUSTRY THAN THERE IS IN SCIENCE FOR ACADEMIA
COMMUNICATION IS FUNDAMENTAL TO ANY PROFESSIONAL CAREER IF YOU DON'T DEVELOP A FULL MASTERY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE YOU WON'T SUCCEED AS A SCIENTIST
TO ADD TO WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID AND BE SORT OF IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU AREN'T IN COLLEGE YET WHICH LEADS ME TO THINK THAT YOU PROBABLY HATE WRITING ABOUT BOOKS BECAUSE OF THE WAY YOU'VE BEEN TAUGHT TO THINK AND WRITE I USED TO FEEL THE SAME WAY BUT AFTER TAKING A COLLEGE WRITING COURSE AND TUTORING FOR THAT COURSE FOR YEARS I REALIZED THAT WRITING IS MUCH MORE ABOUT CRITICAL THINKING THAN ANYTHING ELSE UNFORTUNATELY MOST HIGH SCHOOLS DON'T TEACH THIS

MOST HIGH SCHOOLS ALSO ENCOURAGE A DIVIDE BETWEEN THOSE WHO ARE GOOD AT WRITING HISTORY ETC SUBJECTS AND THOSE WHO ARE GOOD AT MATH AND SCIENCE STEM SUBJECTS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THOSE SUBJECTS ARE TESTED BEYOND THIS THOUGH THERE'S NO REASON YOU CAN'T BE GOOD AT BOTH IN FACT IF YOU'RE GOOD AT CRITICAL THINKING AND REASONING YOU SHOULD BE GOOD AT BOTH

I'M IN A PHD PROGRAM NOW AND CAN STILL SAY THAT SOME OF THE BEST MENTAL EXERCISES I'VE GONE THROUGH HAVE BEEN IN WRITING AND LITERATURE CLASSES I TOOK WHERE I HAD TO THINK ABOUT EXTREMELY COMPLEX PROBLEMS WHERE INSTEAD OF WRITING OUT EQUATIONS TO GET AN ANSWER YOU HAVE TO DISCUSS WITH OTHERS THINK ON YOUR OWN AND WRITE AND REWRITE MANY TIMES BEFORE YOU GET TO A SOLUTION YOU'LL NEVER GET THIS TYPE OF MENTAL STRETCHING IN PHYSICS BUT IT WILL UNDOUBTEDLY MAKE YOU A BETTER READER WRITER AND THINKER AND THUS A BETTER SCIENTIST
WRITING A PHYSICS PAPER IS REALLY NOT THE SAME AS WRITING AN ESSAY ON A RANDOM TOPIC YOU BASICALLY PRESENT YOUR OWN WORK NOT SOME RANDOMLY THOUGHT UP STUFF REGARDING THE INTERPRETATION OF SOME PIECE OF LITERATURE WITH A MINIMUM WORD THRESHOLD
SPEAKING AS A CAREER PHYSICIST YOUR MOTHER IS CORRECT OVER THE LAST THREE DECADES I HAVE SPENT ALMOST AS MUCH TIME WRITING REPORTS PAPERS PRESENTATIONS PROPOSALS REVIEWS PRESS RELEASES ARTICLES ETC AS I HAVE DOING MORE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF MY JOB IT IS AN UNAVOIDABLE PART OF THE CAREERS OF ALMOST EVERY SCIENTIST TODAY
I ALSO HATED WRITING ESSAYS IN SCHOOL AND IT'S TRUE THAT YOU HAVE TO DO A GOOD AMOUNT OF WRITING IF YOU'RE DOING PHYSICS IN MY EXPERIENCE THE WRITING ISN'T THAT BAD THOUGH BECAUSE YOU'RE WRITING ABOUT PHYSICS YOU'RE EXPLAINING SUMMARIZING SOMETHING YOU'VE SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME WORKING ON IT'S EASIER TO WRITE IN SOME SENSE BECAUSE IT'S MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD AND DOESN'T REQUIRE YOU TO ANALYZE ONE SENTENCE WRITTEN BY SOMEONE ELSE AND WRITE AN ENTIRE PAPER ON WHAT YOU THINK IT MEANS

I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT TOO MUCH THE OTHER GOOD THING ABOUT WRITING IN PHYSICS IS THAT YOU DON'T GET ASSIGNMENTS THAT REQUIRE YOU TO WRITE PAGES MINIMUM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IF YOU CAN WRITE EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO IN ONE PAGE THEN THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO WRITE
I STUDIED PHYSICS IN PART BECAUSE I DIDN'T LIKE HAVING TO READ TEXTBOOKS MUCH OR WRITE ESSAYS IF YOU PAY CLOSE ATTENTION IN CLASS AND ARE REASONABLY SMART WILLING TO WORK THROUGH A LOT OF PROBLEMS YOU CAN PULL IT OFFICIAL I THEN WENT ON TO GET MY PH D AND CONTINUED NOT HAVING TO READ OR WRITE MUCH FOR QUITE A WHILE THERE ARE PAPERS READING WRITING AND EVENTUALLY YOUR THESIS BUT NOT TOO MUCH REALLY HOWEVER I THINK IT WOULD BE KIND OF ABSURD TO BASE YOUR CAREER PATH ON THAT ALONE BUT WHO AM I TO JUDGE
UNDERGRAD BSC PHYSICS WORD DISSERTATION AND WORD PROJECT REPORT IN FINAL YEAR ALONG WITH 2 WORD LAB REPORTS EACH SEMESTER ON TOP OF THAT A FEW MODULES HAD ESSAYS FOR EACH TOPIC

THAT SAID A BOOK REPORT AND TECHNICAL WRITING ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF LANGUAGE USED SO DON'T EVEN THINK THEY ARE ANYWHERE CLOSE TO SIMILAR
A GENERAL HINT FOR WRITING PLEASE CHOOSE A TITLE THAT DESCRIBES THE ACTUAL CONTENTS IF YOUR TITLE WAS IS THIS TRUE THAT THERE IS A LOT OF WRITING IN PHYSICS EVERYONE WOULD KNOW THAT IT IS A GENERAL QUESTION FOR PHYSICISTS THE BENEFIT WOULD BE THAT PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY WOULD SPOT THE TITLE AND OPEN THIS THREAD AND ANSWER
IF YOU'RE LOOMING INTO GOING TO COLLEGE AT ALL THEN BE PREPARED FOR A LIFETIME OF PAPERS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WRITE PAPERS THEN I WOULD SUGGEST GETTING A CAREER IN SOME TRADE LIKE WELDING
THIS IS NOT A NEW SOLUTION THERE ARE A MILLION WAYS TO IMPROVE THE OPTICS OF THE SOLAR CELL INTERFACE SPECULAR REFLECTION IS ANOTHER LOSS MECHANISM THE PROBLEM WITH ALL OF THEM IS THE ADDITIONAL COST OF FABRICATING THESE STRUCTURES FAR EXCEEDS THE GAIN IN EFFICIENCY RIGHT NOW THE CONTACTS ARE SCREEN PRINTED OVER LARGE AREA HOW WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO MAKE TRIANGULAR CROSS SECTION LOW INDEX MATERIAL ON TOP OF THE CONTACTS OVER SQUARE METERS OF PANEL CHEAPLY AND EFFICIENTLY
CLEVER IDEA IT'S A NICE WAY OF AVOIDING THE USUAL TRADEOFF BETWEEN OPTICAL EFFICIENCY AND WIRE DENSITY ALSO IT COULD BE A MORE SIGNIFICANT ISSUE FOR USE IN PHOTOVOLTAICS WHERE CURRENT DENSITY IS HIGHER

APPARENTLY THIS SCIENCE THREAD IS OVERRUN WITH ENGINEERS INCLUDING ME HAHA BUT WE OUGHT TO HAVE SOME APPRECIATION FOR THEORETICAL PHYSICS EVEN IF IT ISN'T DIRECTLY APPLICABLE BECAUSE IT DID PROVIDE A SOLUTION TO A TECHNICAL PROBLEM AND MAYBE THE SOLUTION WILL INSPIRE A PRACTICAL DESIGN FOR MANUFACTURE FOR EXAMPLE MAYBE A LENS OR DIFFRACTION GRATING OR OTHER OPTICS COULD BE FABRICATED INTO THE TO GET A SIMILAR EFFECT OR MAYBE SOMEONE WILL THINK OF A WAY TO BUILD OPTICS ON TOP OF A WIRE CONTACT PERHAPS BY USING THE ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES OF THE WIRE

EDIT YOU GUYS MIGHT NOT REALIZE THAT IF IT WEREN'T FOR THIS ISSUE OF WIRES BEING OPAQUE DESIGNS WOULD USE A HIGHER WIRE DENSITY BECAUSE IT REDUCES ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE SO IT IS MORE EFFICIENT
SOUNDS LIKE A SMART SOLUTION I WOULDN'T HAVE GUESSED THAT THE METAL CONTACTS NEED TO TAKE UP ANY OF THE LIGHT COLLECTING SURFACE AREA WHY AREN'T THEY ALL ON THE BACK SIDE
COMING SOON TO A BUZZFEED ARTICLE NEAR YOU

MFG THIS ONE SIMPLE TRICK WILL REVOLUTIONIZE THE WAY WE USE SOLAR CELLS MUCH WOW
THE EXACT SHAPE IS STILL A MATTER OF DEBATE IN PHYSICAL COSMOLOGY BUT EXPERIMENTAL DATA FROM VARIOUS INDEPENDENT SOURCES AMAP BOOMERANG AND PLANCK FOR EXAMPLE CONFIRM THAT THE OBSERVABLE UNIVERSE IS FLAT WITH ONLY A MARGIN OF ERROR
THE EVIDENCE IS RATHER GOOD AT PRESENT IT GOES LIKE THIS DECADES AGO THERE WAS A DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER THE UNIVERSE WAS POSITIVELY CURVED LIKE A SPHERE NEGATIVELY CURVED LIKE A SADDLE OR FLAT AS TIME HAS PASSED EVIDENCE HAS ACCUMULATED SUGGESTING THAT THE UNIVERSE HAS NO CURVATURE AT ALL

WHAT IS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN ZERO CURVATURE AND AN INFINITE UNIVERSE LET ME ANSWER WITH AN EXAMPLE THE SURFACE OF A SPHERE IMAGINE THAT WE LIVE IN A TWO-DIMENSIONAL WORLD CALLED FLATLAND THAT IS ON THE SURFACE OF A SPHERE THE FLATLANDERS WANT TO KNOW HOW BIG THEIR UNIVERSE IS SO THEY TRY TO MEASURE THE CURVATURE OF THE SURFACE AROUND THEM TO THEIR SURPRISE THEY DISCOVER THE SURFACE IS PERFECTLY FLAT NO MEASURABLE CURVATURE AT ALL SO THEY CONCLUDE THAT THEIR UNIVERSE IS INFINITE IN SIZE

HOW DID THE FLATLANDERS DRAW THAT CONCLUSION BASED ONLY ON THEIR CURVATURE MEASUREMENT THINK REALLY HARD ASK YOURSELF WHAT THE RADIUS IS OF A SPHERE WHOSE SURFACE IS PERFECTLY FLAT

OUR COSMOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS IN FOUR DIMENSIONS PRODUCED THE SAME RESULT AND THE SAME CONCLUSION
HEH IT'S REALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW THE CONNECTION BETWEEN CURVATURE AND FINITENESS ONLY WORKS IF HOMOGENEITY HOLDS UP TO ARBITRARILY LARGE SCALES WHICH MIGHT AS WELL BE FALSE
LOOKS LIKE OUR UNIVERSE IS FLAT IF IT'S FINITE IT CAN'T BE ISOTROPIC SO MY BETS GO TO INFINITE
THERE IS ACTUALLY A BEAUTIFUL ALBEIT PURELY THEORETICAL AND PRACTICALLY USELESS CONNECTION BETWEEN FINITY AND SIGNATURE OF THE METRIC

ASSUMING THE UNIVERSE IS A SEMISIMPLE LIE GROUP THE ONLY ISOTROPIC AND HOMOGENEOUS SOLUTION TO FIELD EQUATIONS IS THE KILLING METRIC

IF YOU EVER WONDERED WHY THE MINKOWSKI METRIC HAS A CERTAIN SIGNATURE THIS POINT OF VIEW PROVIDES AN ANSWER TO THAT A HUGE BUT IS COMING AT THE END COMPACT I EAST FINITE DIMENSIONS PROVIDE EACH A SIGNATURE INFINITE LIMELIKE DIMENSIONS EACH A HENCE BY KNOWING THE SIGNATURE OF OUR METRIC WE'D CONCLUDE THE UNIVERSE TO BE FINITE IN SIZE I EAST COMPACT

BUT THERE IS NO SEMISIMPLE LIE GROUP WITH JUST ONE LIMELIKE DIMENSION THEY ALL HAVE AT LEAST TWO SINCE WE ONLY HAVE ONE LIMELIKE DIMENSION THERE CLEARLY IS SOMETHING AMISS

ALSO PEOPLE CHECKED FOR REPEATING STRUCTURES WE'D SEE IF OUR UNIVERSE WAS INDEED FINITE THINK OF A TOWER OF MIRRORS NONE WERE FOUNDATION
NOT SURE WHAT IS WITH THESE ANSWERS THERE IS NO KNOWN KNOWLEDGE TO BASE A PROBABILITY OFF OF INFINITE IS MORE INTUITIVE BUT IT BY NO MEANS HAS ANY EVIDENCE
THE UNIVERSE IS FLAT STRANGEST DEJA VU
THE FUTURE HEADLINE WILL BE THAT THE UNIVERSE IS INFINITE BUT THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE IS A PERPETUALLY GROWING MASSIVE SPHERE WITHIN THAT INFINITY THAT GROWING SPHERE IS FINITE AND THE GALAXIES AND UNIVERSE WE SEE WITH OUR TELESCOPES IS A TINY SPHERICAL GLIMPSE WITHIN A NARROW BAND ON AS AN AN ANALOGY THE SKIN OF A BASKETBALL EVERYTHING INSIDE THE BASKETBALL SKIN WOULD BE NEWER MORE CONDENSED MATTER EXPANDING OUT TOWARD US AND EVERYTHING OUTSIDE THE BASKETBALL'S SKIN WOULD BE OLDER MORE DISPERSED MATTER THE SKIN IS PERPETUALLY GETTING LARGER IN VOLUME AS IT EXPANDS OUT AND OUR HUBBLE DEEP FIELD VIEW WOULD CONSIST OF APPROXIMATELY ONE ATOM OF ALL THE ATOMS IN THE SKIN OF THE BASKBATBALL ALONE THE THICKNESS OF THE BASKETBALL SKIN WOULD BE ABOUT TRILLION LIGHT YEARS THICK ON THE INTERIOR EDGE OF THIS SKIN IS WHERE NEW GALAXIES FORMULATE ON THE EXTERIOR EDGE OF THE SKIN IS WHERE THEY DISINTEGRATE ONLY INSIDE THE SKIN IS WHERE GALAXIES AS WE KNOW THEM EXIST

SOMETHING CANNOT COME INTO EXISTENCE WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF NOTHINGNESS IT IS A LOGICAL PARADOX THE ONLY RATIONAL CONCLUSION IS THAT THE UNIVERSE IS INFINITE IN SIZE AND DURATION BUT SINCE WE KNOW THAT IT IS DYNAMIC AND NOT A STATIC CONTINUUM AT LEAST WHERE WE ARE IN THE UNIVERSE WE KNOW THAT THERE IS SOME GENERATIVE PROCESS AN ALGORITHM IF YOU LIKE THAT IS STIRRING THINGS UP NOTHING CAN KICK-START THIS BECAUSE WHATEVER YOU PROPOSE TO DO IT ALSO NEEDS TO BE EXPLAINED THEREFORE THE GENERATIVE PROCESSES ORIGIN HAS TO BE PART OF THE ORIGINAL STRUCTURE OF THE UNIVERSE ITSELF THE ONLY UNBIASED GENERATIVE PROCESS SHAPE WHICH EQUALLY EFFECTS ALL DIRECTIONS IS A SPHERE THERE IS NO REASON THAT THERE WOULD BE A BIAS SUCH AS A CUBE SHAPE GENERATIVE PROCESSES HAVE TO WORK WITHIN ANYTHING MORE OR LESS GOES AGAINST ALL EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATION

FURTHERMORE AN INFINITE UNIVERSE IN SIZE AND DURATION ALSO HAS AN INFINITE GENERATIVE PROCESS THERE IS NO REASON FOR IT TO STOP THERE IS NOT A BIG BANG BUT INSTEAD A CONTINUAL SHOWERING OF NEW MATTER FROM WITHIN THE BASKETBALL GENERATED BY THE CORE IN THE CENTER THERE IS ALSO NO SUCH THING AS EMPTY VOID SPACE IT IS ENTIRELY FILLED BY A FLUIDIC AETHER WHICH CANNOT BE DETECTED BY CURRENT EQUIPMENT BECAUSE ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE IS MADE FUNDAMENTALLY OF THE SAME STUFF THIS AETHER IS CONTINUALLY FLOWING TOWARD THE BASKETBALL CORE FROM THE INFINITE BACKDROP OF THE UNIVERSE WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY BECOME PARTICLEIZED MATTER AND REVERSE DIRECTION AWAY FROM THE CORE

TO ASSUME THAT THIS WILL ALL BE COMMON KNOWLEDGE IN THE FUTURE WE CAN THEN ASK QUESTIONS LIKE COULD YOU FLY A SPACESHIP TO THE EDGE OF THE UNIVERSE AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WOULD YOU CRASH OR WOULD SOMETHING MAGICAL HAPPEN LIKE IN WHEN YOU GO OFF THE SCREEN AND SPAWN ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OR WHAT THE ANSWER IS THAT AS YOU MOVE AWAY FROM THE SKIN OF THE BASKETBALL WHICH REPRESENTS THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE YOU WOULD EVENTUALLY REACH A POINT WHERE THE SPACESHIP WOULD EITHER DISINTEGRATE IN THE CASE OF MOVING AWAY FROM THE CORE OF THE BASKETBALL TOO FAR OR CONDENSE ON ITSELF CHANGING THE STRUCTURE OF THE SPACESHIP INTO BEING JUST A GLOB OF MATTER EFFECTIVELY DESTROYING IT BY TRANSFORMATION IN THE CASE OF MOVING TOO FAR TOWARD THE CORE AS YOU MOVE AROUND IN THE FIELD OF THE BASKETBALL'S CORE THE AMBIENT DENSITY CHANGES WHICH CHANGES THE DYNAMICS OF MOVEMENT AS WELL AS THE FORMULATION OR DECONSTRUCTION OF MATTER EVEN ELECTROMAGNETIC ENERGY WOULD HAVE THE SAME DEMISE AS IT TOO CONSISTS OF SUBSTANCE EVERYTHING IS MADE FROM THE SAME FUNDAMENTAL BUILDING MATERIAL
WELL EVERYTHING THAT WE KNOW ARE THEORIES THEY COULD BE DISPROVEN EVENTUALLY WE DON'T KNOW FOR CERTAIN ALSO THERE'S MUCH DEBATE STILL SO THERE'S NOT A DEFINITE ANSWER DEPENDS ON WHO YOU DECIDE TO BELIEVE
HOW CAN YOU PROVE THAT THE UNIVERSE IS INFINITE OR FINITE BUT BEYOND OUR OBSERVABLE UNIVERSE IF ITS BEYOND OUR REACH HOW COULD YOU MEASURE IT
YOU MAY DEBATE BUT NEVER PROVE IT BEYOND A MATHEMATICAL HYPOTHESIS
I MEAN WHAT DO YOU DEFINE INFINITE SO LARGE THAT WE'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO FULLY EXPLORE IT OR EVEN MAP IT WITHIN OUR LIFETIME BECAUSE THAT'S THE REALITY EVEN IF IT IS A FINITE SIZE IT'S HUGE ENOUGH THAT WE'LL NEVER SEE ALL OF IT EVEN A SMALL FRACTION OF IT

IF THE UNIVERSE WERE TRULY INFINITE THE NIGHT SKY WOULDN'T BE DARK THE UNIVERSE IS FINITE YET INFINITELY EXPANDING
SINCE THERE IS NO WAY TO TELL I WOULD SAY
PROBABLY AROUND A ONE IN INFANTE PROBABILITY
VERY GOOD THE BEST IN FACT EDIT OUCH I GUESS FLIP REPLIES ARE NOT APPRECIATED HERE STILL MY COMMENT STANDS IT IS VERY LIKELY THE UNIVERSE IS INFINITE IT FITS IN BETTER WITH OUR THEORIES AND MEASUREMENTS
CRAP ARTICLE WHICH MERELY NAME DROPS AND RAISES MORE QUESTIONS
IN THESE EXPERIMENTS ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT RIGHT CHIRAL NEUTRINOS OR AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CHARGE LEPTON BEYOND THE SM
I KNOW EVERY UNI IS DIFFERENT BUT I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT THE ONE I'M AT

THEY OFFER FOUR DEGREE TITLES PHYSICS ASTROPHYSICS PHYSICS WITH ASTROPHYSICS AND THEORETICAL PHYSICS ALL EITHER BSC OR MPHPS DEGREES FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS THEY ARE VERY VERY SIMILAR THE ONLY DIFFERENCES BEING THE THEORETICAL STUDENTS TAKE ANALYSIS CLASSES INSTEAD OF DOING LABS AND WHEN PHYSICS STUDENTS GET OPTIONAL MODULES THE THEORETICAL AND ASTRO STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY HAD THEIR MODULES CHOSEN THIS MAKES IT VERY EASY TO CHANGE BETWEEN COURSES UP UNTIL THE END OF THE SECOND YEAR I'M CURRENTLY ON FOR A BSC IN PHYSICS BUT I WANT TO CHANGE TO THE MPHPS AND THAT SHOULD BE VERY EASY TO DO

WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS DON'T PANIC TOO MUCH THE COURSES ARE GOING TO BE VERY SIMILAR FOR AT LEAST THE FIRST YEAR IF NOT THE FIRST TWO YEARS AND MOST UNIVERSITIES SHOULDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH YOU CHANGING COURSES

BE SURE TO GO AND VISIT THE DEPARTMENTS THAT YOU'RE APPLYING TO IF POSSIBLE AND ASK THEM ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE IF THAT'S TOO DIFFICULT DISTANCE OR TRAVEL COSTS THEN EMAIL THE DEPARTMENT AND THEY WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE

BEST OF LUCK IN YOUR SEARCH
TAKE A LOOK AT THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR EACH DEGREE SCHEME AND THEN PICK THE MOST FLEXIBLE FOR MY UNDERGRAD THERE WAS PHYSICS ASTROPHYSICS THEORETICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS MEDICAL PHYSICS AND PHYSICS WITH ASTRONOMY PHYSICS WITH ASTRONOMY ALLOWED YOU TO TAKE ANY COMBINATION OF MODULES INCLUDING THOSE UNDER ALL THE OTHER DEGREE SCHEMES SO IN A SENSE ALL OTHER DEGREES WERE A SUBSET OF THE CHOICES AVAILABLE TO THE PHYSICS WITH ASTRONOMY SCHEME AND THEREFORE IT MADE NO SENSE TO PICK ANYTHING ELSE THEN WITH REGARD TO MODULE CHOICES LOOK AT THE SYLLABUS LEARNING OUTCOMES AND PAST PAPERS FOR EACH MODULE AND JUST DO WHAT YOU FIND INTERESTING YOU CAN SWITCH BETWEEN A AND YEAR DEGREE RIGHT UP UNTIL THE END OF YOUR 3RD YEAR AS LONG AS YOUR GRADES ARE GOOD SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT UNTIL FURTHER DOWN THE LINE
THEORETICAL AND ASTROPHYSICS ARE GOING TO BE LARGELY THE SAME TRACK UNTIL YOUR LATER YEAR AS WITH A BACHELOR'S VS UNDERGRAD MASTERS TRACK IN OTHER WORDS YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE TO DECIDE RIGHT AWAY PROBABLY CAN STILL MOVE THINGS AROUND EVEN IN JUNIOR YEAR

ALSO WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU MEAN BY THEORETICAL PHYSICS
IF YOU WANT TO DO THEORETICAL PHYSICS YOU SHOULD CHOOSE THAT RIGHT FROM THE START IT MAY BE DIFFERENT AT OTHER USIS BUT I GO TO A UNI IN THE UK AND HERE THE THEORY STUDENTS GET PRETTY MUCH INDEPENDENT MENTORING BECAUSE THE MATHEMATICS CONTENT IS SO MUCH TOUGHER FOR THEM IT'S PRACTICALLY A DIFFERENT COURSE FROM STRAIGHT PHYSICS YOU CAN SWITCH TO THEORETICAL PHYSICS LATER THOUGH PROBABLY END OF 2ND YEAR LATEST BUT IT IS ISN'T EASY

AS FOR OTHERS THEY WILL DIFFER EARLY ON A LOT IN WHAT LABS THEY DO BUT THE LECTURES WON'T BE TOO DIFFERENT UNTIL AT LEAST THE 2ND YEAR

THEORETICAL AND ASTRO ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AND MOST THEORETICAL WON'T COVER ANY ASTRO MODULES AND VICE VERSA UNLESS THEY CHOOSE TO

DECO DO THE UNDERGRAD MASTERS IF YOU HAVE ANY DESIRE TO CONTINUE WITH PHYSICS AFTER YOUR UNDERGRADUATE IT'S NOT A BAD IDEA ANYWAY ALL THE BEST MODULES ARE IN THE FOURTH YEAR AND YOU GET TO DO A BIG RESEARCH PROJECT WHICH COULD LAND YOU NICELY IN A PHD POSITION

EDIT I DO STRAIGHT PHYSICS BUT I PICK ALL THE THEORY MODULES BECAUSE I FIND THEM THE MOST INTERESTING
STUDYING FAMOUS PEOPLE IS PRONE TO SURVIVORSHIP BIAS AND IT IS LIKELY TO LEAD YOU TO FALSE CONCLUSIONS
FEYNMAN LOVED HAVING SEX AND PLAYING THE BONGOS

NEWTON LIVED CELIBATE

EINSTEIN WAS A SOCIAL BUTTERFLY AND NEVER STOPPED WORKING

DIRAC HARDLY EVER SPOKE AND WAS EXTREMELY AFRAID OF SOCIAL SITUATIONS

THERE'S NOT MUCH OF A TREND
IN HIS BOOK LETTERS ON ENGLAND THE FRENCH PHILOSOPHER VOLTAIRE WRITES OF ISAAC NEWTON

SIR ISSAC DURING THE LONG COURSE OF YEARS HE ENJOYED WAS NEVER SENSIBLE TO ANY PASSION WAS NOT SUBJECT TO THE COMMON FRAILTIES OF MANKIND NOR HAD ANY COMMERCE WITH WOMEN A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH WAS ASSURED ME BY THE PHYSICIAN AND SURGEON WHO ATTENDED HIM IN HIS LAST MOMENTS

SHORTLY THEREAFTER THE ENGLISH MATHEMATICIAN CHARLES HUTTON WRITES IN THE CHAPTER MEMOIRS OF THE LIVES AND WRITINGS OF THE MOST EMINENT AUTHORS COMMENTING FURTHER ON ABSTINENCE

NEWTON NEVER MARRIED AND IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT PERHAPS HE NEVER HAD LEISURE TO THINK OF IT THAT BEING IMMERSED IN PROFOUND STUDIES DURING THE PRIME OF HIS AGE AND AFTERWARDS ENGAGED IN AN EMPLOYMENT OF GREAT IMPORTANCE AND EVEN QUITE TAKEN UP WITH THE COMPANY WHICH HIS MERIT DREW TO HIM HE WAS NOT SENSIBLE OF ANY VACANCY IN LIFE NOR OF THE WANT OF A COMPANION AT HOME THESE HOWEVER DO NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY SUFFICIENT REASONS FOR HIS NEVER MARRYING IF HE HAD HAD AN INCLINATION SO TO DO IT IS MUCH MORE LIKELY THAT HE HAD A CONSTITUTIONAL INDIFFERENCE TO THE STATE AND EVEN TO THE SEX IN GENERAL AND IT HAS EVEN BEEN SAID OF HIM THAT HE NEVER ONCE KNEW WOMAN

APPARENTLY THE POLITICAL PHILOSOPHER JOHN LOCKE ONCE TRIED TO SET UP NEWTON WITH SOME GIRLS BUT NEWTON WAS NOT IMPRESSED AND LATER WROTE A LETTER TO LOCKE THAT BEGAN

SIR
BEING OF OPINION THAT YOU ENDEAVOURED TO EMBROIL ME WITH FOEMEN BY OTHER MEANS I WAS SO MUCH AFFECTED WITH IT AS THAT WHEN ONE TOLD ME YOU WERE SICKLY WOULD NOT LIVE I ANSWERED TWERE BETTER IF YOU WERE DEAD

TL R ACCORDING TO PRIMARY SOURCES NEWTON WAS SERIOUSLY COMMITTED TO CELIBACY AND DEVOTED HIS LIFE TO MATTERS BEYOND THE CARNAL
I THINK THEY USE PENCILS OR PENS AND PAPER A LOT ALSO THEY TEND TO USE COMPUTERS AND SIT AT TABLES I THINK READING TEXTBOOKS IS PRETTY COMMON HABIT
IN A LOT OF QM BOOKS YOU'LL FIND MORE OR LESS INTERESTING
STORIES ABOUT SCHRÖDINGERS MANY RELATIONSHIPS TO WOMEN AT SOME POINT
HE AND HIS WIFE LIVED TOGETHER WITH MR AND MRS WEYL THE LEGEND TELLS

FUNDAMENTALLY WHAT DOES THE PRINCIPLE QUANTUM NUMBER N COUNT I THINK ANSWERING THAT QUESTION WILL ANSWER YOUR QUESTION
TAKE A LOOK AT THE BLACK RINGS IN THE AND ORBITALS THIS IMPLIES THE DENSITY IS IN THOSE RINGS DOESN'T HAVE THESE AND HAS DENSITY WHERE THESE ARE IN THE OTHER TWO IF THE PLOTS WERE ADDITIVE OR SHOWING THEM TOGETHER THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY BLACK RINGS
IT'S A SLICE THROUGH THE ORBITAL THE IS NOT SHOWN REMEMBER THAT THE NS ORBITALS HAVE N RADIAL NODES SO THEY WILL FLIP SIGN N TIMES WHICH IS PROBABLY WHAT LEADS YOU TO SEE THE ILLUSION OF A ORBITAL IN THE IMAGE
IN YOUR SOURCE AND INCLUDE DIRECTORIES YOU PROBABLY HAVE SOME FILES CALLED AND OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THESE SHOULD CONTAIN YOUR PHYSICAL PROCESSES

IF YOU DON'T HAVE THOSE JUST RUN A GREP FOR DECAY AND SEE IF YOU CAN FIND WHERE MUON DECAY IS HANDLED IN THE CODE
I'M HOPING TO SEE SOME DISCUSSION ON THIS TOPIC INSPIRED BY ANOTHER THREAD

HOW DO YOU INTERPRET LAW WHAT KIND OF TRENDS DO YOU EXPECT OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS WHY
ALL LAW OR OBSERVATION SAYS IS THAT THE NUMBER OF TRANSISTORS PER UNIT AREA ON A SUBSTRATE WILL DOUBLE PER UNIT TIME

SO THE ONLY ADVANCEMENT IS MINIATURIZATION NOT PERFORMANCE NOT SWITCHING TIMES NOT TECHNOLOGY NOT DOING ANYTHING NECESSARILY BETTER JUST DOING THE SAME THING IN A SMALLER SPACE SURE SOME SECONDARY IMPROVEMENTS IN LOWER TRANSISTOR SWITCHING POWER CONSUMPTION FROM LOWER INDUCTANCE AND CAPACITANCE AND SHORTER PATH LENGTHS BUT HALF THE SIZE DOES NOT MEAN TWICE THE PERFORMANCE
I PERSONALLY FIND THIS VERY EXCITING REDUCING DIE SIZES HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE METHOD USED TO MEET THE CONSUMER DEMAND TO INCREASE PERFORMANCE NOW ECONOMICALLY AND TECHNOLOGICALLY THIS LOOKS TO BE OUT OF THE QUESTION BUT IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT PERFORMANCE WILL NOT INCREASE INSTEAD IT MEANS THAT TECH COMPANIES CAN FINALLY LOOK TOWARDS NEW WAYS TO INCREASE PERFORMANCE IT MEANS I THINK A HIGHER EMPHASIS ON OPTIMIZING THE STRUCTURE OF THE CHIPS AND THE UNDERLYING IDEAS ON HOW TO ACHIEVE EFFICIENT CALCULATION
LAW IS HALVING THE SIZE OF TRANSISTORS EVERY 2 YEARS BUT THERE ARE STILL PLENTY OF INNOVATIONS GOING ON THAT COULD WELL MORE THAN DOUBLE THE SPEED OF THE CHIPS SO LAW HAS BECOME IRRELEVANT

COMPUTING

ARTICLE

LAPTOPS OPINION

EXTREME


AGAIN
THINGS LIKE MEMRISTORS AND 3D STACKED CIRCUITS SHOULD ALLOW THE GROWTH CURVE TO CONTINUE FOR A FEW YEARS ESPECIALLY IN APPLICATIONS IN TERMS OF PERFORMANCE PER WATT ANYWAYS MAYBE EVEN LONGER IF QUANTUM COMPUTING IS MADE HINGING ON SUPER CONDUCTORS
I HAVE HEARD THAT CARBON NANOTUBES COULD POTENTIALLY TAKE OVER
I AM EXTREMELY HEARTENED BY THE RECENT CONFIRMATION OF TOPOLOGICAL STATES OF MATTER AND I HOPE TOPOLOGICAL INSULATORS WILL CRUSH LAW AS SOON AS WE'RE ABLE TO CONTROL THEM

SPINTRONICS MUST ALSO EMERGE AT SOME POINT AS THE TECHNOLOGY WHICH WILL MAKE CURRENT TRANSISTORS SEEM LIKE VACUUM TUBES IN OUR MINDS
FIRST IF LAW IS NOT TRUE THEN STOP CALLING IT A LAW CALL IT PREDICTION

SECOND

EVERYONE AGREES THAT THE TWILIGHT OF LAW WILL NOT MEAN THE END OF PROGRESS THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO AIRPLANES

YES THINK OF HOW AIR TRAVEL USED TO HAVE SONGS WRITTEN ABOUT HOW MODERN AND EXCITING IT IS TO HAVE THE FREEDOM TO TRAVEL AROUND THE GLOBE IN STYLE IT HAS SINCE BECOME A OPERATION THAT TREATS PEOPLE LIKE SARDINES WHO APPARENTLY HAVE TO PAY FOR WATER AND BATHROOM USE AND LUGGAGE FEES ETC I WOULD HOPE COMPUTING DOESN'T GO THIS ROUTE

IT WOULD SEEM COMPUTER SCIENTISTS HAVE A MAJOR PROBLEM ON THEIR HANDS IN THE DAYS WHEN PREDICTION WAS CORRECT HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE ALIKE BENEFITTED FROM A PREDICTABLE ARCHITECTURE ON PREDICTABLY FASTER CPUS NOW THAT THE HARDWARE MAY BE CHANGING THERE SEEMS TO BE AN URGENT NEED TO HAVE AN AGNOSTIC LANGUAGE OR LANGUAGE BASE THAT CAN HANDLE AND CPU AND GPU INSTRUCTIONS WITHOUT HAVING TO REQUIRE REWRITES OF SOFTWARE EVERY TIME HARDWARE IS UPGRADED THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN SCIENTIFIC FIELDS WHERE CODES TAKE DECADES TO DEVELOP

PLEASE KEEP WORKING HARD COMPUTER SCIENTISTS I REALLY WANT TO SEE SOME COMMON THREAD NO PUN INTENDED IN LANGUAGE SUPPORT AS SYSTEMS BECOME MORE HETEROGENEOUS

EDIT REMOVED IRRELEVANT COMMENTS
QUANTUM COMPUTING WILL CATCH UP AND SURPASS IN LESS TIME THAN YOU MAY THINK
I UNDERSTAND THAT RESISTANCE COULD POTENTIALLY BE THE BALANCING FORCE

YES THERE IS A DRAG FORCE ACTING ON THE ELECTRONS IT WORKS OUT THAT ON AVERAGE THE ELECTRONS MOVE ALONG WITH SOME CONSTANT VELOCITY

SEE THE CRUDE MODEL
APART FROM THE RESISTIVE MECHANISM THAT KEEPS THINGS LINEAR I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE OTHER PROBLEMS WITH YOUR ANALYSIS

CURRENT IS A FLUX OF CHARGE THROUGH A SURFACE IN UNIT TIME ITS VALUE DOES NOT DEPEND ON WHETHER THE CHARGE IS ACCELERATING AS IT GOES THROUGH THE SURFACE OR NOT

ON THE OTHER HAND IF AN EVEN DISTRIBUTION OF CHARGE IS MOVING AT A VELOCITY THROUGH THE SURFACE THE VELOCITY DETERMINES HOW MUCH OF THE DISTRIBUTION PASSES THROUGH THE SURFACE

DOES THAT DISTINCTION MAKE SENSE
THANKS ALL I REMEMBER LEARNING THIS A LONG TIME AGO NOW
CAN YOU EXPLAIN IN MORE DETAIL WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT
THE MUSIC OH GOD THE MUSIC
THIS IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING I HAVE PONDERED UPON FOR A GOOD WHILE NOW I KNOW MAGNETIC SENSORS USE IT FOR POSITION SENSING USING THIS CONCEPT I AM RATHER INTERESTED IN HEARING PEOPLE'S THOUGHTS ABOUT THIS
THIS IS AMAZING I WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW THIS WAS PRODUCED
THE MORE I LEARN ABOUT THESE FORCES THE MORE I'M INTERESTED

CAN WE DISCUSS THE PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS OF THIS
YOU'RE GREATLY MISUNDERSTANDING WHAT AN OBSERVATION IN THE SENSE OF WAVE FUNCTION COLLAPSE IS

FIRST THERE ARE NO N-DIMENSIONAL BEINGS THERE IS NOT EVEN THE CONCEPT OF A BEING IN STRING THEORY IF WE TAKE WOULD ASSUME N DIMENSIONS THEN EVERYTHING IS LIVING IN TEN DIMENSIONS BECAUSE THE PARTICLES WE ARE MADE OF LIVE THERE

SECONDLY NOT PERCEIVING THE EXTRA DIMENSIONS IS NOT THE SAME AS NOT OBSERVING THEM THE PARTICLES WE ARE MADE OF INTERACT WITH THE EXTRA DIMENSIONS HENCE WE OBSERVE THEM HOWEVER WE DO NOT PERCEIVE THE EXTRA DIMENSIONS AS THE EFFECTS ARE TOO TINY TO BE NOTICED WITH OUR SENSES

THINK OF CAT JUST BECAUSE YOU'VE GONE ASLEEP DOESN'T MEAN THE WAVE FUNCTION FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD IS SUDDENLY UNOBSERVED

TL R NOT SEEING THE EXTRA DIMENSIONS IS NOT THE SAME AS NOT OBSERVING THEM US HUMANS WOULD STILL OBSERVE WHAT HAPPENS THERE

THAT COLLAPSE NEGATIVELY AFFECTS THE BEINGS WHICH CAN HOLD ALL THE DIFFERENT PROBABILITIES BUT ARE UPSET TO HAVE THEIR REALITY REDUCED IS THE STORY IN QUARANTINE BY GREG EGAN
NOT REALLY A STRING THEORIST BUT I HAVE READ A LOT ON WAVE FUNCTION COLLAPSE


IT'S NOT REALLY WELL UNDERSTOOD HOW WAVE FUNCTION COLLAPSE WORKS SO YOU'RE PRETTY FREE TO HAVE BEINGS CAUSE WAVE FUNCTION COLLAPSE BY AN ACT OF OBSERVATION THAT'S A PRETTY SAFE LEAP FOR A FICTIONAL STORY ALTHOUGH SOME EXPERTS WOULD DISAGREE WITH IT


HOWEVER IT LOOKS LIKE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WAVE FUNCTION COLLAPSE WHEN YOU SAY THAT DIMENSIONAL BEINGS CAN CAUSE COLLAPSE WHILE OTHERS ARE BEYOND IT WHAT MAKES DIMENSIONAL BEINGS DIFFERENT FROM BEINGS


ADDITIONALLY WAVE FUNCTION COLLAPSE IS NOT JUST A COLLAPSE IN POSITION SPACE IT CAN ALSO BE A COLLAPSE IN MOMENTUM SPACE THE WAVE FUNCTION CAN DESCRIBE A SYSTEM'S POSITION S AND ITS MOMENTUM S AND ENERGY DES WHEN IT COLLAPSES IN ONE SPACE I EAST IT GIVES ONE VALUE FOR POSITION OR MOMENTUM STATES IT EXPANDS IN ANOTHER SPACE GIVES MULTIPLE VALUES FOR POSITION MOMENTUM STATES LET'S SAY OUR WAVE FUNCTION TELLS US THE SYSTEM IS AT LOCATION IN THE X DIRECTION THEN IT MIGHT TELL US THE MOMENTUM IN THE X DIRECTION IS A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT VALUES I SHOULD SAY THAT POSITION AND MOMENTUM SPACE ARE JUST WORDS THAT MEAN THE WHOLE SET OF POSITION AND MOMENTUM STATES ANY SYSTEM COULD HAVE


THIS IS USUALLY TRUE FOR BOTH THE MOMENTUM AND POSITION OF A PARTICULAR COORDINATE DIRECTION IF THE WAVE FUNCTION COLLAPSES IN X POSITION IT EXPANDS IN X MOMENTUM IF IT COLLAPSES IN Y MOMENTUM IT EXPANDS IN Y POSITION I HAVEN'T STUDIED STRING THEORY BUT I ASSUME THIS PATTERN IS TRUE FOR SPACES WITH HIGHER DIMENSIONS TOO


WHAT THIS MEANS IS HOW MANY DIMENSIONS YOU HAVE IN YOUR SPACE HAS NO BEARING ON WAVE FUNCTION COLLAPSE AND IF IT DOES I FAIL TO UNDERSTAND HOW SORRY EVEN FURTHER IF WE ASSUME THAT THE ACT OF OBSERVATION CAUSES WAVE FUNCTION COLLAPSE IT WOULD APPEAR THAT DIMENSIONAL BEINGS CANNOT CAUSE WAVE FUNCTION COLLAPSE IN THE OTHER DIMENSIONS BECAUSE THEY CANNOT OBSERVE THEM UNLESS THEY DO SOME NIFTY PROBING IN OTHER WORDS DIMENSIONAL BEINGS WOULD HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME COLLAPSING WAVE FUNCTIONS IN THE


PERSONALLY I AGREE WITH THE DECOHERENCE VIEWPOINT WHICH SUGGESTS THAT EXACT OR CLOSE DECOHERENCE IS EQUIVALENT WITH COLLAPSE THE GENERAL RULE OF THUMB FOR DETERMINING THIS DECOHERENCE IS BY JUDGING THE CONSERVATIONS OF THE SYSTEM IF THE SYSTEM CONSERVES ENERGY MOMENTUM THEN THE POSITION STATES OF THE SYSTEM ARE EXPANDED IF IT IS PROBED HEAVILY WITH HIGH ENERGY PARTICLES I EAST IT QUICKLY CHANGES IN ENERGY MOMENTUM THEN THE SYSTEM HAS VERY COLLAPSED POSITION STATES APPLYING THIS TO THE PREMISE OF YOUR BOOK IT SEEMS LIKE WAVE FUNCTION COLLAPSE HAS LITTLE DEPENDENCE ON WHETHER YOU'RE A DIMENSIONAL BEING OR AN BEING AS LONG AS YOU CAN CHANGE A SYSTEM'S ENERGY MOMENTUM QUICKLY YOU CAN COLLAPSE ITS POSITION STATES
THIS ARTICLE IS PRETTY POORLY NAMED THEY MAINLY JUST ARGUE THAT TOPOLOGICAL MATERIALS MAY BE USED TO MAKE A GENERAL QUANTUM COMPUTER ONE DAY ALSO IT HAS THIS GEM OF A SENTENCE

ONE BIG OBSTACLE IS THAT THESE COMPUTERS ARE VERY FRAGILE WITH RESPECT TO SURROUNDING NOISE

THIS IS THE MAIN REASON WHY WE DON T YET USE QUANTUM COMPUTERS IN OUR EVERYDAY LIVES




BUT ARE THEY REALLY THOUGH
HERE IS THE TEXT OF THE ARTICLE FOR THOSE WHO DON'T WANT TO DISABLE ABP





BRITISH SCIENTISTS DAVID THOWLESS DUNCAN HALDANE AND MICHAEL
KOSTERLITZ A HRE REL NOFOLLOW WON THIS YEAR S NOBEL PRIZE IN PHYSICS
FOR THEORETICAL DISCOVERIES OF TOPOLOGICAL PHASE TRANSITIONS AND
TOPOLOGICAL PHASES OF MATTER


THE REFERENCE TO THEORETICAL DISCOVERIES MAKES IT TEMPTING TO
THINK THEIR WORK WILL NOT HAVE PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS OR AFFECT
OUR LIVES SOME DAY THE OPPOSITE MAY WELL BE TRUE


TO UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL IT HELPS TO UNDERSTAND THE THEORY
MOST PEOPLE KNOW THAT AN ATOM HAS A NUCLEUS IN THE MIDDLE AND
ELECTRONS ORBITING AROUND IT


THESE CORRESPOND TO DIFFERENT ENERGY LEVELS WHEN ATOMS GROUP
INTO SUBSTANCES ALL THE ENERGY LEVELS OF EACH ATOM COMBINE
INTO A HRE REL NOFOLLOW BANDS OF ELECTRONS EACH OF THESE SO-CALLED
ENERGY BANDS HAS SPACE FOR A CERTAIN NUMBER OF ELECTRONS AND
BETWEEN EACH BAND ARE GAPS IN WHICH ELECTRONS CAN T FLOW


IF YOU APPLY AN ELECTRICAL CHARGE A FLOW OF EXTRA ELECTRONS TO
A MATERIAL ITS CONDUCTIVITY IS DETERMINED BY WHETHER THE HIGHEST
ENERGY BAND HAS ROOM FOR MORE ELECTRONS IF IT DOES HAVE ROOM
THE MATERIAL WILL BEHAVE AS A CONDUCTOR


IF NOT YOU NEED EXTRA ENERGY TO PUSH THE CURRENT OF ELECTRONS
INTO A NEW EMPTY BAND AND AS A RESULT THE MATERIAL BEHAVES AS AN
INSULATOR UNDERSTANDING CONDUCTIVITY IS VITAL TO ELECTRONICS
SINCE ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS ULTIMATELY RELY ON COMPONENTS THAT ARE
ELECTRIC CONDUCTORS SEMICONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS


WHAT THOWLESS HALDANE AND KOSTERLITZ BEGAN TO PREDICT IN THE
AND AND A HRE REL NOFOLLOW OTHER THEORISTS HAVE A HRE REL NOFOLLOW SINCE TAKEN A HRE REL NOFOLLOW FORWARD IS THAT CERTAIN MATERIALS BREAK THIS
RULE INSTEAD OF HAVING A GAP BETWEEN BANDS IN WHICH ELECTRONS
CAN T FLOW THEY HAVE A SPECIAL ENERGY LEVEL BETWEEN THEIR BANDS
WHERE CERTAIN UNEXPECTED THINGS ARE POSSIBLE

A HRE REL NOFOLLOW THIS QUALITY ONLY EXISTS ON THE SURFACE
OR EDGE OF THESE MATERIALS AND IS VERY ROBUST IT ALSO DEPENDS
TO SOME EXTENT ON THE SHAPE OF THE MATERIAL THE TOPOLOGY AS WE
SAY IN PHYSICS


IT BEHAVES IDENTICALLY FOR A SPHERE AND AN EGG FOR EXAMPLE BUT
WOULD BE DIFFERENT FOR SOMETHING SHAPED LIKE A DOUGHNUT BECAUSE
OF THE HOLE IN THE MIDDLE THE FIRST MEASUREMENTS OF THIS KIND OF
BEHAVIOUR HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR A CURRENT ALONG A HRE REL NOFOLLOW THE BOUNDARY OF A FLAT SHEET


COMPUTER POWER


THE PROPERTIES OF THESE SO-CALLED TOPOLOGICAL MATERIALS COULD
POTENTIALLY BE EXTREMELY USEFUL ELECTRICAL CURRENTS CAN MOVE
WITHOUT RESISTANCE ACROSS THEIR SURFACE FOR EXAMPLE EVEN WHERE
A DEVICE IS MODERATELY DAMAGED

A HRE REL NOFOLLOW SUPERCONDUCTORS CAN ALREADY DO THIS
WITHOUT HAVING TOPOLOGICAL PROPERTIES BUT THEY ONLY WORK AT VERY
LOW TEMPERATURES MEANING YOU USE A LOT OF ENERGY KEEPING THEM
COOL TOPOLOGICAL MATERIALS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DO THE SAME JOB
AT HIGHER TEMPERATURES


THIS HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR COMPUTING MOST OF THE ENERGY
COMPUTERS CURRENTLY USE IS TO RUN VENTILATORS TO COOL DOWN THE
HEAT PRODUCED BY ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE IN THE CIRCUITS REMOVE
THIS HEAT PROBLEM AND YOU POTENTIALLY MAKE THEM MANY TIMES MORE
ENERGY EFFICIENT


THIS COULD MASSIVELY REDUCE THEIR CARBON EMISSIONS FOR INSTANCE
IT COULD ALSO LEAD TO BATTERIES WITH FAR LONGER LIFE SPANS
RESEARCHERS ARE ALREADY EXPERIMENTING WITH TOPOLOGICAL MATERIALS
LIKE CADMIUM TELLURIDE AND MERCURY TELLURIDE TO
BRING A HRE REL NOFOLLOW THIS VISION TO LIFE


THERE IS ALSO THE POTENTIAL FOR A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH IN QUANTUM
COMPUTING CLASSICAL COMPUTERS ENCODE INFORMATION BY EITHER
APPLYING VOLTAGE OR NOT APPLYING VOLTAGE TO A CHIP THE COMPUTER
READS THIS AS A OR RESPECTIVELY FOR EACH BIT OF
INFORMATION YOU PUT THESE BITS TOGETHER TO BUILD UP MORE COMPLEX
INFORMATION THIS IS HOW THE BINARY SYSTEM WORKS


WITH QUANTUM COMPUTING YOU DELIVER INFORMATION TO ELECTRONS
INSTEAD OF MICROCHIPS THE ENERGY LEVELS OF THESE ELECTRONS THEN
CORRESPOND TO ZEROS AND ONES JUST LIKE IN CLASSICAL COMPUTERS
BUT IN QUANTUM MECHANICS BOTH CAN BE TRUE AT THE SAME TIME


WITHOUT GETTING INTO TOO MUCH THEORY THIS RAISES THE POSSIBILITY
OF COMPUTERS THAT CAN PROCESS EXCEEDINGLY LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA
IN PARALLEL AND ARE THEREFORE MUCH FASTER


SPAN CLASS KONAFILTER IMAGE
BMG SRC ALT IBM QUANTUM COMPUTING FLICKR IBM
SPAN CLASS SOURCE FLICKR IBM



WHILE THE LIKES OF A HRE REL NOFOLLOW GOOGLE AND A HRE REL NOFOLLOW IBM ARE RESEARCHING HOW TO MANIPULATE ENOUGH
ELECTRONS TO CREATE QUANTUM COMPUTERS THAT ARE MORE POWERFUL THAN
CLASSICAL COMPUTERS ONE BIG OBSTACLE IS THAT THESE COMPUTERS ARE
VERY FRAGILE WITH RESPECT TO SURROUNDING NOISE


WHEREAS CLASSICAL COMPUTERS CAN COPE WITH INTERFERENCE QUANTUM
COMPUTERS END UP PRODUCING INTOLERABLE NUMBERS OF ERRORS BECAUSE
OF SHAKY SUPPORT FRAMES STRAY ELECTRICAL FIELDS OR AIR MOLECULES
HITTING THE PROCESSOR EVEN IF YOU HOLD IT IN A HIGH VACUUM THIS
IS THE MAIN REASON WHY WE DON T YET USE QUANTUM COMPUTERS IN OUR
EVERYDAY LIVES


ONE POTENTIAL SOLUTION IS TO STORE INFORMATION IN MORE THAN ONE
ELECTRON SINCE NOISE TYPICALLY AFFECTS QUANTUM PROCESSORS AT THE
LEVEL OF SINGLE PARTICLES SUPPOSING YOU HAVE FIVE ELECTRONS ALL
JOINTLY STORING THE SAME BIT OF INFORMATION SO LONG AS THE
MAJORITY STORE IT CORRECTLY A DISTURBANCE TO A SINGLE ELECTRON
WON T UNDERMINE THE SYSTEM


RESEARCHERS HAVE BEEN EXPERIMENTING WITH THIS SO-CALLED MAJORITY
VOTING BUT TOPOLOGICAL ENGINEERING POTENTIALLY OFFERS AN EASIER
FIX


IN THE SAME WAY AS TOPOLOGICAL SUPERCONDUCTORS CAN CARRY A FLOW
OF ELECTRICITY WELL ENOUGH THAT IT DOESN T GET HAMPERED BY
RESISTANCE TOPOLOGICAL QUANTUM PROCESSORS COULD BE ROBUST ENOUGH
TO BE INSENSITIVE TO NOISE PROBLEMS THEY COULD YET OFFER A MAJOR
CONTRIBUTION TO MAKING QUANTUM COMPUTING A REALITY RESEARCHERS
IN THE US A HRE REL NOFOLLOW ARE WORKING ON IT


THE FUTURE


IT MIGHT TAKE BETWEEN TEN AND YEARS BEFORE SCIENTISTS BECOME
SUFFICIENTLY GOOD AT MANIPULATING ELECTRONS TO MAKE QUANTUM
COMPUTING POSSIBLE BUT THEY OPEN UP EXCITING POSSIBILITIES THEY
COULD SIMULATE THE FORMATION OF MOLECULES FOR EXAMPLE WHICH IS
NUMERICALLY TOO COMPLICATED FOR TODAY S COMPUTERS


THIS COULD REVOLUTIONISE DRUG RESEARCH BY ENABLING US TO PREDICT
WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING CHEMICAL PROCESSES IN THE BODY


TO GIVE JUST ONE OTHER EXAMPLE QUANTUM COMPUTING HAS THE
POTENTIAL TO MAKE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE A REALITY QUANTUM
MACHINES MAY BE BETTER AT LEARNING THAN CLASSICAL COMPUTERS
PARTLY BECAUSE THEY MIGHT BE UNDERPINNED BY MUCH CLEVERER
ALGORITHMS CRACKING AI COULD BE A STEP CHANGE IN HUMAN EXISTENCE
FOR BETTER OR WORSE


IN SHORT THE PREDICTIONS OF THOWLESS HALDANE AND KOSTERLITZ
HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO HELP REVOLUTIONISE CENTURY COMPUTER
TECHNOLOGY WHERE THE NOBEL COMMITTEE HAS RECOGNISED THE
IMPORTANCE OF THEIR WORK IN WE ARE LIKELY TO BE THANKING
THEM MANY DECADES INTO THE FUTURE

DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY IDEA ON BOOKS THAT COVER IN A SOMEWHAT DEEPER WAY THAN THE USUAL OUTLOOK ON POTENTIAL APPLICATION OR EXPERIMENT THAT APPEARS IN SOME MORE GENERAL BOOKS

I'M A PHYSICS STUDENT IN MY LAST YEAR OF UNDERGRAD WHO'S LOOKING TO DO GRADUATE STUDIES IN THAT SUBJECT SO I'M LOOKING TOWARDS SOME FIELD BOOK THAT COVERS THE SUBJECT IN DEPTH IF THERE'S ANY
RECOMMENDATIONS ON A GOOD SOLID INTRO TO HYDRODYNAMICS FOR A
AFT INTRO TEXTS I'VE ALREADY ASKED THIS QUESTION ONCE IN ASKPHYSICS BUT HAD NO TIME TO REALLY START THEN I GUESS MORE OPTIONS CAN NEVER HURT
I'M NEW TO ENGINEERING CURRENTLY STUDYING TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENGINEERING AND I WANT TO BUY A GOOD PHYSICS BOOK TO USE DURING MY WHOLE DEGREE
I'VE FOUND A BOOK FROM WHICH MY TEACHERS DRAG MOST OF THE EXERCISES THE PHYSICS FOR SCIENTIFICS AND ENGINEERS BY SEAWAY
THE QUESTION IS THAT I WANT TO BUY IT BUT THE HARDCOVER VERSION IS QUITE TOO EXPENSIVE SO I'VE FOUND A LIGHT VERSION THIS VERSION SAYS INTERNATIONAL EDITION SO I'M NOT SURE WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE HARDCOVER EDITION AND THE INTERNATIONAL ONE

SORRY FOR MY BAD GRAMMAR BUT MY MAIN LANGUAGE IS SPANISH
ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR A GOOD ELECTRONICS TEXTBOOK MY PROFESSOR RECOMMENDS HOROWITZ HILL BUT I FIND IT A BIT CONFUSING AND I'VE READ IT'S NOT GOOD AS AN INTRODUCTORY TEXT ANYWAY
I JUST STARTED MY UNDERGRAD AND I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT TEXTBOOKS IN GENERAL DO YOU EVER GO BACK AND USE YOUR UNDERGRAD TEXTBOOKS IN OTHER WORDS ARE THERE ANY WORTH BUYING OR SHOULD I CONTINUE RENTING RIGHT NOW I'M IN CLASSICAL MECHANICS USING TAYLOR AND I JUST RENTED THE BOOK FOR THE SEMESTER
I THINK THE THEORETICAL MINIMUM PROVIDES SOME REALLY GREAT VIDEO LECTURES BUT I HAVE A HARD TIME FIGURING OUT WHICH BOOKS I SHOULD READ ALONGSIDE THE LECTURES AND COURSES ANYONE WHO COULD RECOMMEND SOME BOOKS

IT SHOULD BE BOOKS THAT GIVES A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF PHYSICS LIKE BOOKS YOU WOULD READ WHEN TAKING A COURSE AT COLLEGE
I HAVE WHAT MAY BE A SOMEWHAT IRREGULAR REQUEST I'M INTERESTED IN COURSE WEBPAGES SYLLABI SPECIFICALLY ONES FOR COURSES WHICH FOLLOW ONE TEXTBOOK RATHER CLOSELY AND HOPEFULLY POST WHICH TEXTBOOK SECTIONS TO READ AND HOMEWORK PROBLEMS SOLUTIONS OPTIONAL I'M DOING THE STRING THEORY FOR UNDERGRADS COURSE ON MIT ACW RIGHT NOW AND I THINK IT'S GREAT WHEN I'M DONE I'D LIKE TO MOVE ON TO

AFT I II

STRING THEORY I II

IDEALLY I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW PESKIN AND SCHROEDER OR MAYBE SCHWARTZ FOR AFT AND POLCHINSKI FOR THE STRING THEORY UNFORTUNATELY THE MIT ACW COURSES FOR THESE DON'T FOLLOW ONE TEXT SO CLOSELY OR DON'T HAVE READINGS LISTED AT ALL SO THEY MAKE FOR MORE DIFFICULT SELF-STUDY I ENJOY FROM TEXTBOOK BUT I LIKE TO HAVE A SCHEDULE FROM A COURSE TO TELL ME HOW MUCH IS A NICE PIECE PER SESSION AND WHEN IS A GOOD TIME TO SIT DOWN AND WORK ON PROBLEMS I'VE GOOGLED AND FOUND A COUPLE THAT SEEM ALRIGHT IN A PINCH BUT I'M WONDERING IF ANYONE KNOWS ANY THAT MATCH WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR MORE CLOSELY FINALLY BONUS POINTS FOR

ADVANCED AFT STANDARD MODEL PHENOMENOLOGY USUALLY

STRING THEORY TOPICS COURSES

THANKS TO ANYONE WHO CAN HELP
BECAUSE ELECTRONS FLOWING THROUGH MOS 2 ARE HEAVIER THEIR FLOW CAN BE CONTROLLED WITH SMALLER GATE LENGTHS

WHAT
CERTAINLY NOT THE SMALLEST TRANSISTORS HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN THEY ARE JUST NOT PRACTICAL AT THE MOMENT AND OF COURSE THE CONNECTIONS TO THE TRANSISTORS NEED MANY ATOMS MORE
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO READ THIS IN COMIC BOOK OF THE SIMPSONS VOICE
LAW KEEPS GETTING PUSHED OUT DUE TO HUMAN CREATIVITY
PLEASE GOV SITE DON'T SAY BLANK EST BLANK EVER YOU'RE A GOVERNMENT SITE FFS NOT A YEAR OLD
NOT THE SMALLEST TRANSISTOR EVER AND FRANKLY NOT THE LOWEST POWER TRANSISTOR YOU COULD EVEN MAKE USING CMDS SO OVERALL I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW THIS GOT FUCKING PUBLISHED IN SCIENCE HONESTLY THERE'S NOTHING ACTUALLY NEW LEARNED FROM THIS EXPERIMENT AND NOTHING COMPELLING ENOUGH TO REPEAT IT THE CROSS-SECTIONAL TEM IMAGE LOOKS COOL BUT THAT'S THE EXTENT OF THE PAPER WE PUT A SCANT BELOW SOME REALLY DOPED MOS 2 YOU CAN CREATE BETTER BY PUTTING THESE CMDS SEMICONDUCTING MATERIALS IN A TUNNEL FET CONFIGURATION WITH LOWER VOLTAGE REQUIREMENTS I'VE LITERALLY SEEN MUCH BETTER PERFORMANCE OFF STANDARD 2 STACKS
THE FIRST TRANSISTORS WERE AS BIG AS CARS NOW THEY'RE AS SMALL AS TOMATOES KEN PARAPHRASED
GET OUTTA TOWN
ANYONE MAKE AN EDUCATED GUESS AS TO WHAT KIND OF THERMAL TEMPS TRANSISTORS MIGHT MAKE ASSUMING WE'RE TALKING MOLYBDENUM DISULFIDE WHICH THEY'RE USING
AWESOME NEWS LETS NOW WAIT FOR YEARS TO SEE WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE TO HAVE THEM MASS PRODUCED OR NOT

PAGE SOUTH ALSO LETS NOT FORGET ABOUT SPINTRONICS AND THEIR TRANSISTORS
I THOUGHT DARK MATTER WOULDNT INTERACT WITH THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE WHY WOULD THEY TRY TO DETECT IT WITH A STRONG MAGNETIC FIELD
IF THEY DETECT ANIONS IN THE EXPERIMENT I REALLY HOPE SOMEONE SHOUTS HEY PRESTO
WHY WE KEEP STICKING PARTICLES INTO OUR CONCEPTUAL HOLES PARTICLES IN THIS SENSE ARE SIMPLY THE FACILITATION OF A NECESSARY EFFECT NECESSARY THAT IS TO RETAIN THE CURRENT MODEL
HERE'S IDEAS IN A PDF

NRL SA T SOURCE WEB RCT J NRL

I HOPE THIS IS USEFUL
SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT WAY TO LEARN A LOT ABOUT STATICS AND SPREADSHEETS NICE THAT YOU CAN POST HERE AND GET SUPPORT FROM US OTHER WEIRDOS WHO THINK THIS SORT OF THING IS A BLAST
SPREADSHEETS ARE AWESOME NEXT STEP PROGRAMMING DO YOU KNOW ANY PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES IF NOT I RECOMMEND LEARNING PYTHON YOU CAN DO SOME AWESOME PHYSICS STUFF IN PYTHON EVEN AS A BEGINNER
ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY IS RATHER IMPORTANT AND SHOULD DEFINITELY BE CONSIDERED FOR ANY EXTENDED STAY IN SPACE
WHEN IT COMES TO ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY FOCUS IS USUALLY PLACED ON UTILIZING CENTRIFUGAL FORCE BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S THE MOST EFFICIENT METHOD WHEN WE ARE CONSIDERING SPACE TRAVEL
CONSIDER RE-ENTRY INTO AN ATMOSPHERE ANY SPINNING MODULE IS GOING TO ENCOUNTER HUGE STRESS
A DIFFERENT METHOD OF GENERATING ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY COULD BE DONE BY USING MAGNETICALLY POLARIZED PLATES AND SUITS PRACTICALLY ANYTHING WHICH CAN PUSH THE HUMAN BODY DOWN COULD BE USED AS A GRAVITY REPLACEMENT

FOR ANYONE CONCERNED ABOUT THE MINUTE TIME LENGTH TAG THE SUMMARY LASTS FROM
WHAT'S THE ANALOGY OF THE BAGEL HOLES FOR THE SOLID STATE SYSTEM
I TOOK A CLASS IN TOPOLOGY ONCE THERE WERE NO BAGELS WHATSOEVER I FEEL CHEATED
AT OLD MATE IS STARING AT THAT BAGEL THINKING DON'T BREAK IT I'LL EAT THAT
I WISH YOUTUBE HAD SOME SORT OF AUTOMATIC PROCESSING THANKS FOR THE UPLOAD
ANYTHING LIKE THIS FOR THE NOBEL PRIZE IN MEDICINE
TOPOLOGY IS A FIELD OF MATHEMATICS THAT DESCRIBES PROPERTIES THAT ARE STABLE AND ONLY CHANGE IN INTEGER STEPS

WOW THAT'S A PRETTY POOR CHARACTERIZATION OF WHAT TOPOLOGY IS ABOUT THAT'S LIKE SAYING THAT QUANTUM MECHANICS IS A FIELD OF PHYSICS THAT DESCRIBES PROPERTIES OF CATS

ISN'T THAT KINDA A STEP FUNCTION
I WAS HOPING FOR SOME DISCUSSION ALREADY ANYWAY

AT ABOUT SECONDS IN A NUMBER OF EQUATIONS ARE WRITTEN FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THESE APPLY ONLY TO ISOLATED OBJECTS AND PROCESSES WITHIN SPACETIME NONETHELESS I AM AWARE THAT THE QM ONE MAY BE ABLE TO DESCRIBE THE WHOLE OF SPACETIME HOW EXACTLY I DO NOT KNOW SOMEONE KINDLY EXPLAIN IN OTHER WORDS I CAN INDEED DESCRIBE A MOTION WITH F MA WITHOUT REFERRING TO CAUSE AND EFFECT BUT THIS IS THE CASE BECAUSE I'VE DELIBERATELY ISOLATED THAT OBJECT AND THAT PROCESS FROM THE REST OF REALITY HOWEVER IN THE EVENT THAT MULTIPLE OBJECTS OR PROCESSES INTERACT CAUSE AND EFFECT ENTERS INTO OUR EXPLANATORY PICTURE ONCE MORE A CHANGE IN MOTION CAN BE SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF ANOTHER BALL BUMPING INTO IT IF FOLLOWING OUR BEST PHYSICS IT IS ONLY THIS ACT OF SELECTIVE ISOLATION RATHER THAN ANYTHING ELSE THAT MAKES CAUSE AND EFFECT UNREAL EVEN FOR ELEMENTARY OBJECTS AND PROCESSES THEN WOULD THIS NOT ALSO IMPLY THAT THE WAY WE UNDERSTAND INTERACTIONS AND SYSTEMS THROUGH PHYSICS WILL ALWAYS BE INCOMPLETE LIMITED IN JUST THE SENSE DESCRIBED

COULD SOMEONE CRITIQUE ME HERE ANY CLARIFICATIONS WOULD BE WELCOME

EDITS FOR CLARIFICATION I WAS SIMPLY WRITING MY STREAM OF THOUGHT THE FIRST TIME
YES AND THAT IS WHY FTL IN ANY FORM IS IMPOSSIBLE
IF YOU'RE SOLVING THE POISSON EQUATION ARE YOU ONLY INTERESTED IN STATICS IN THAT CASE LOOK INTO THE METHOD OF RELAXATION
THIS PAPER PAPER IS VERY NICE IN EXPLAINING THE INNER WORKINGS OF THE FARADAY CAGE AND ALSO HAS CODE FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM IN 2D
ABOUT ME UNDERGRADUATE PHYSICS MAJOR WITH ASTRONOMY CONCENTRATION AND MATH MINOR I WORK PART TIME DOING TUTORING AND GRADING FOR K STUDENTS OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL

I WANT TO GO INTO TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL OR COMMUNITY COLLEGE I ONLY LEFT OUT UNIVERSITY BECAUSE I DON'T THINK I WANT TO GET A PHD AND I AM UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT TEACHING AT UNIVERSITY REQUIRES A PHD PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M MISTAKEN JUST HAVE SOME QUESTIONS

COULD I FIND WORK DOING WHAT I'VE STATED I WANT TO DO WITH ONLY A BS AND NOT AN MS NOT OPPOSED TO PURSUING A MASTERS JUST CURIOUS

2 SHOULD I EXPECT TO STRUGGLE FINANCIALLY IF I CHOOSE TO PURSUE A TEACHING CAREER I TOLD MY MOM THAT I HAVE AN INTEREST IN TEACHING AND SHE TOLD ME THAT I WOULD END UP POOR

TEACHING SEEMS LIKE A GREAT CAREER FOR ME I LOVE PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS I LIKE HELPING OTHERS UNDERSTAND CONCEPTS AND I WANT A CAREER WITH A FAIR WORK LIFE BALANCE SO THAT I CAN HAVE TIME TO DEVOTE TO OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT SUCH AS PLAYING IN BANDS AND BEING WITH MY FAMILY I'M AWARE THAT I WON'T EVER BE MAKING A YEAR LIKE MY PARENTS BUT I ALSO DON'T WANT TO END UP POOR AND HUNGRY I COULD USE SOME GUIDANCE
YOU THINK ITS POSSIBLE TO WORK ON THEORETICAL PHYSICS ON THE SIDE I DONT KNOW WHAT ASPECT OF PHYSICS I WOULD LIKE TO DO BUT I ENJOY WORKING WITH EQUATIONS JUST GOT REALLY INTO PHYSICS RECENTLY
I'M THINKING ABOUT MAJORING IN EITHER PHYSICS OR MATH NEXT YEAR IN UNIVERSITY HS SENIOR NOW I'M APPLYING TO SEVERAL SCHOOLS SUCH AS TUFTS UMASS AND BOWDOIN AND THEY AREN'T AS HIGHLY RATED IN THESE FIELDS AS SOME OF THE OTHER SCHOOLS I AM APPLYING TO DO THESE RANKINGS OR PRESTIGE OF THE SCHOOL REALLY MATTER AT UNDERGRAD OR IS IT MORE OF WHAT GRADES I GET RESEARCH DONE IN UNDERGRAD THAT WILL HAVE MORE OF AN IMPACT ON A CAREER IN STEM WHETHER IT BE RESEARCH OR WITH A PRIVATE EMPLOYER
WHAT ARE THE BEST KINDS OF JOBS TO GO FOR WITH A NEW PHYSICS DEGREE I'M ONLY A SOPHOMORE SO I HAVEN'T FOCUSED IN ANY ONE AREA YET
HAS ANYONE SWITCHED INTO MATERIALS SCIENCE PHD PROGRAMS FROM BACHELOR'S IN PHYSICS I'M TOO INTERESTED IN INNOVATION TO KEEP GOING IN PURE PHYSICS ANY TIPS OR WAYS TO MAKE YOUR APPLICATION STAND OUT AGAINST ENGINEERS
I'M PROBABLY GOING TO MAJOR IN PHYSICS NEXT YEAR AT A UNIVERSITY MY ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO MOVE TO THE STATES AND START A CAREER AS A ROCKET SCIENTIST I KNOW THAT MAJORING IN PHYSICS IS DEFINITELY NOT THE MOST OPTIMAL DEGREE FOR THIS PARTICULAR CAREER PATHOLOGY THE THING IS I AM VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT PHYSICS AND I WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE UNIVERSE WORKS ALONG WITH THE ART BEHIND SOLVING PROBLEMS I AM PLANNING ON DOING MY BACHELOR IN PHYSICS IN BELGIUM AND AFTERWARDS DOING SOMETHING LIKE AERONAUTICAL ENGINEERING THAT WILL PREPARE ME FOR THAT ULTIMATE GOAL IN THE STATES AT THE MOMENT I HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE IN ENGINEERING SINCE I WENT TO A TECHNICAL SCHOOL IT'S A LONG STORY I KIND OF CHANGED MY MIND WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT I WANT TO DO IN LIFE MY QUESTION IS TO WHAT EXTENT WILL A DEGREE IN PHYSICS HELP ME AS A ROCKET SCIENTIST AND WHAT FIELD IN PHYSICS SHOULD I CHOOSE UNFORTUNATELY MY FUTURE UNIVERSITY DOESN'T OFFER ANY MINORS MORE CLOSELY RELATED TO ROCKET SCIENCE THAN PHYSICS
WHAT TIPS WOULD YOU OFFER TO AN UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT ATTEMPTING TO CRAFT HIS OWN RESEARCH PROJECT
I AM A PHYSICS MAJOR I'M STILL A SOPHOMORE AND I'VE ONLY SEEN ONE CHEMISTRY AND CURRENTLY WORKING ON ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY BOTH WITH LAB WORK WHAT FASCINATES ME IS SPACETIME AND GRAVITATIONAL STUDIES I WANT TO START WORKING IN A LAB BUT I'M NOT SURE WHAT KIND OF ENTRY LEVEL WORK I COULD FIND WITH THE LIMITED KNOWLEDGE I HAVE GATHERED THROUGH MY YEAR AT COLLEGE THAT WILL HELP ME IN MY GOALS I LIVE IN MIAMI IF THAT IS OF ANY HELP I WILL BE MEETING WITH THE HEAD OF THE PHYSICS DEPARTMENT THIS WEEK TO FIND SOME HELP I KNOW THERE IS NO SUCH THIS AS A STUPID QUESTION BUT THERE ARE STUPID MOMENTS THAT I HAVE TO MUDDLE THROUGH

MY QUESTION IS WHAT COULD I APPLY TO AT THIS TIME IN MY CAREER THAT WILL HELP ME IN THE FUTURE I AM WAITING ON A RECOMMENDATION LETTER FROM TWO PROFESSORS TO BE ABLE TO APPLY TO AN AEU FOR THE SUMMER OF
I AM A FRESHMAN MAJORING IN PHYSICS AND BEFORE YOU SAY THAT I NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT I WILL LIKE PHYSICS FIRST LET ME TELL YOU MY THOUGHTS

I KNOW THAT COLLEGE PHYSICS IS QUITE DIFFERENT THAN HIGH SCHOOL PHYSICS I KNOW THAT I NEED TO GET A GOOD FEEL FOR PHYSICS BEFORE I DECIDE THAT I WANT TO GO TO GRAD SCHOOL

WITH THAT SAID MY CURRENT PLANS ARE TO GO TO GRAD SCHOOL FINISH UP WITH A DOCTORATE AND EVENTUALLY WORK MY WAY UP TO TEACHING AT A UNIVERSITY AND DOING RESEARCH

AND IF I DO GO TO GRAD SCHOOL I WOULD LIKE TO GO TO A GOOD PROGRAM PREFERABLY TOP HERE ARE THE TOP PROGRAMS

MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY

CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY

HARVARD UNIVERSITY

PRINCETON UNIVERSITY



STANFORD UNIVERSITY


UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY

CORNELL UNIVERSITY

UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO

UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS URBANA CHAMPAIGN

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA




OBVIOUSLY THESE PROGRAMS ARE VERY COMPETITIVE AND THE STUDENTS ARE SELECTED BASED ON HOW MUCH THEY EXCELLED IN COLLEGE AND ON THE GRE WHAT DO THE STUDENTS DO THAT GET INTO THESE PROGRAMS I'LL LET YOU KNOW THAT I AM CURRENTLY GOING TO A SCHOOL THAT IS RANKED IN THE NATION FOR PHYSICS THE UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY NOT THAT GREAT BUT I PLAN ON WORKING HARD ENOUGH TO GET ME INTO A GOOD PROGRAM

WHAT ARE SOME THINGS I CAN BE DOING NOW AS A FRESHMAN UP INTO MY SOPHOMORE YEAR SO I CAN SATISFY MYSELF A SPOT INTO ONE OF THESE SCHOOLS

MY CURRENT PLANS IN COLLEGE ARE TO GAIN GOOD BONDS WITH MY PREFERRED PROFESSORS AND TO ENSURE MYSELF A RESEARCH POSITION WITH THEM IN MY SOPHOMORE JUNIOR AND SENIOR YEAR I ALSO AM REALLY INTERESTED IN EDUCATING PHYSICS TO MASSES THERE IS A PROFESSOR AT MY UNIVERSITY THAT IS NOTICED AS A SPECTACULAR PRESENTER AND WORKS A LOT WITH EDUCATING CHILDREN ON BASIC PHYSICS PRINCIPLES THAT SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING THAT WOULD FIT MY PREFERENCE PRECISELY SO I AM CONSIDERING CONTACTING HIM AND SEEING IF I CAN WORK WITH HIM ON SOMETHING

ALSO HOW DO MINORS AFFECT YOUR CHANCES OF GETTING INTO A GOOD GRAD SCHOOL I KNOW HOW DIFFERENT GRAD SCHOOL ACCEPTANCE IS TO UNDERGRAD SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT DOES MINORING IN SOMETHING IN SOMETHING DIFFERENT LIKE PHILOSOPHY OR LINGUISTICS BOTH SERIOUS MINORS THAT I CONSIDERED THEY WOULD BOTH BE SOMETHING I LIKE SET ME APART FROM THE CROWD IN A GOOD WAY

WHAT CAN I BE DOING IN THESE NEXT COUPLE YEARS TO GUARANTEE ME A SPOT IN THE TOP
HUMANS ARE INHERENTLY TERRIBLE AT RANDOMNESS SO I REALLY DON'T SEE THE POINT OF THIS OTHER THAN AS A PR STUNT
THIS IS STUPID WHY

TRY THE QUICK BELL TEST

CONSIDER THE ENTROPY OF THE STING YOU PRODUCED
IT'S PROBABLY LOTS AND LOTS OF FOLLOWED BY OH SHIT I'M JUST REPEATING MYSELF OH SHIT THAT'S NOT RANDOM EITHER BACK TO

PEOPLE SUCK AT RANDOMNESS
IS NOT THEIR DESCRIPTION OF OBSERVER COMPLETELY WRONG I DON'T THINK MODERN QUANTUM PHYSICS REQUIRES A PERSON TO OBSERVE EVENTS BEFORE THEY'RE DETERMINED
REMINDME DAYS
SIMILARLY I HEARD ABOUT AN EXPERIMENT WHERE THE SEEDS FOR ANG FOR EACH SIDE OF THE BELL TEST WERE FROM COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND LIGHT FROM OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE CB SO THAT EACH PHOTON HADN'T HAD THE CHANCE TO GET TO THE OTHER DETECTOR YET I THOUGHT THIS WAS A BRILLIANT WAY TO GET THE DETECTOR ORIENTATIONS TO REALLY BE INDEPENDENT
I WONDER IF THERE ARE SPECIFIC GAMES OR TASKS THAT WOULD REALLY GET AT WHAT HUMANS CAN BE RANDOM ABOUT
THIS IS TODAY RANDOM BUT I CAN'T BEAT THE MASTER LEVEL ORACLE IT SEEMS TO BE GUESSING MY SELECTIONS ABOUT OF THE TIME
ON MOBILE CURRENTLY BUT I COULD PM YOU A GENERAL PHYSICS PAPER I DID FROM FIRST YEAR THAT SHOULD BE THE RIGHT LEVEL I DON'T WANT TO POST IT PUBLICLY BECAUSE IT WILL HAVE MY SCHOOL AND YEAR ON IT NONE OF THE QUESTIONS WILL BE GROUNDBREAKING ALL WILL BE EASILY GOOGLEABLE BUT KNOWING HOW AND WHAT TO SEARCH IS A SKILL IN ITSELF THAT FIRST YEARS WILL NEED TO PRACTICE
THIS MIGHT BE A BIT TOUGH FOR FIRST YEAR STUDENTS BUT YOU ASKED FOR CHALLENGING SO IT MIGHT BE GOOD YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF MATERIAL WITH CONSTANT DENSITY AND TOTAL MASS MASCULINE WHAT SHAPE SHOULD YOU PUT THIS IN SO THAT YOU MAXIMIZE THE SURFACE GRAVITY OF IT AT A GIVEN POINT SOLVING IT REQUIRES SOME CALCULUS OF VARIATIONS WHICH FIRST YEAR STUDENTS MIGHT NOT HAVE SEEN BUT YOU SHOULD SEE IN YOUR SECOND YEAR OR SO

I DON'T REMEMBER THE PARTICULARS BUT ONE THAT TOOK ME PRETTY LONG WAS SOMETHING ABOUT PROVING THAT ANY KINEMATIC TRAJECTORY FROM THE GROUND THAT REACHES IT PEAK WITHIN SOME OF RADIUS R IS BOUNDED BY SOME PARTICULAR FUNCTION OF R AND PERHAPS OTHER PARAMETERS LIKE IT WAS ONLY CALCULUS BUT REQUIRED SOME DIFFERENTIAL MANIPULATION AND CONCEPTUAL TRICKS
TRY LOOKING HERE YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DOWNLOAD THE BOOKS YOU FIND INTERESTING

REQ TERAHERTZ LIBGET OPEN VIEW SIMPLE RES PHRASE COLUMN EF
I HAVE TO BE HONEST I HAVE NEVER SEEN ONE BUT I WISH YOU LUCK
YES BUT I USUALLY JUST REFER TO HIM AS MY CAT
I WAS REVIEWING A PAPER FOR A JOURNAL AND THE PAPER WAS USING A NUMERICAL METHOD TO SOLVE AN EQUATION I HAD DERIVED IN AN EARLIER PAPER I WAS TEMPTED TO ASK THE AUTHORS TO OFFICIALLY NAME THE EQUATION AFTER ME IN THE PAPER BUT I DIDN'T

IN OTHER PAPERS I HAVE HAD PEOPLE REFER TO A NOTATION I USED USING MY NAME
MY LAST NAME IS PRETTY FUNNY SOUNDING TO INTERNATIONAL EARS SO I HOPE NOT
I DON'T BUT A PROFESSOR I WORK DOES AND HE SURE AS HELL USES IT WHEN I HAVE SOMETHING NAMED AFTER ME I'M GOING TO ASSUME IT'S IMPORTANT ENOUGH THAT IT IS NAMED FOR A REASON AND I HAVE NO PROBLEMS WITH TAKING THAT DESERVED GLORY
I REVIEWED A SERIES OF PAPERS LAST YEAR ABOUT A CERTAIN TOPIC ONE REVIEW ARTICLE I FOUND REFERRED TO A MATHEMATICAL MODEL IN A PREVIOUS PAPER AS THE CHR MODEL UPON FURTHER READING I REALIZED HE WAS THE C IN THE CHR AND WAS REFERENCING HIS OWN PAPER FOR THE REVIEW HE TRIED TO NAME HIS OWN MODEL

THIS CAME OUT AROUND THEN A SERIES OF SMALL BREAKTHROUGHS IN THE FIELD OCCURRED AROUND BY HIS OWN GRADUATE STUDENT NONETHELESS AND SHE REFERRED TO IT BY A DIFFERENT NAME SO IT APPEARS HE TRIED TO NAME HIS OWN MODEL BUT THE NAME DIDN'T STICK
YES PHYSICS IS A GREAT ENABLING DEGREE HAVE A LOOK HERE FOR SOME CAREER OPTIONS WITH A PHYSICS DEGREE
SURE I HAVE HAD NUMEROUS JOBS AFTER GETTING MY PHYSICS DEGREE DESIGNING X-RAY TELESCOPES BUILDING REMOTE SENSING INSTRUMENTS DEVELOPING TECHNIQUES FOR TESTING CIRCUIT BOARDS BUILDING MACHINE VISION SYSTEMS FOR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND I AM CURRENTLY WORKING ON A STARTUP COMPANY TO BUILD AND OPERATE A SATELLITE CONSTELLATION TO TRACK HURRICANES MY CLASSMATES HAVE ALSO WORKED IN A MYRIAD OF JOBS DEALING WITH ENGINEERING DEFENSE SYSTEMS MEDICAL IMAGING WRITING SOFTWARE FOR A RANGE OF CONSUMER AND SPECIALTY APPLICATIONS AND LOTS OF RELATED FIELDS EAST G FIREMAN BUSINESS MANGERS ETC I HAVE FOUND THAT A PHYSICS DEGREE GIVES ONE AN EXCELLENT SET OF TOOLS FOR APPROACHING A LARGE RANGE OF SCIENCE ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT PROFESSIONS
YES IT CAN LEAD YOU TO BASICALLY ANYTHING RANGING FROM A WORLD LEADER MERKEL TO A GARBAGE COLLECTOR A MATE OF MINE FROM UNI THE WORLD IS YOUR PROVERBIAL OYSTER
I MEAN THERE'S ALWAYS ENGINEERING AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT
I'VE HEARD OF PHYSICS GRADUATES GOING INTO PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS SUCH AS LAW AND MEDICINE AS WELL AS WORKING IN FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES PHYSICS PROVIDES SUCH A WONDERFUL SKILLET FOR ALL SORTS OF JOBS
YEAH MOST OF THE GUYS WHO I GRADUATED WITH WHO DIDN'T DO PHS ARE EITHER IN HIGH PRECISION ENGINEERING OR FINANCE THERE'S LOTS OF WIGGLE ROOM OUT THERE
I GRADUATED WITH A DEGREE IN PHYSICS AND NOW LEAD AND AI ROBOTICS DEPARTMENT IT'S NOT THE DEGREE THAT MAKES YOU BUT HOW YOU PREPARE YOURSELF

LASER WAKEFIELD POSTHOC HERE IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS
IF THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE ASKING NO YOU CANNOT OBTAIN THE CENTRE OF MASS FROM THE CENTROID YOU NEED TO DO THE WHOLE CALCULATION OF THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF THE POSITIONS ALL OVER AGAIN
HOW ABOUT MODIFYING THE PROGRAM TO MULTIPLY THE LOCATION OF EACH ATOM AMINO ACID BY ITS MOLECULAR MASS
THE CENTROID IS THE CENTER OF MASS IF ALL OF THE ELEMENTS IN THE SYSTEM HAVE THE SAME MASSACHUSETTS IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME MASS YOU HAVE TO USE THE DEFINITION OF CENTER OF MASS TO CALCULATE IT
IT WOULD BE AN ADJUSTMENT TO YOUR PROGRAM EACH PIECE THAT YOU USED TO COME UP WITH THE CENTROID WOULD HAVE TO BE MULTIPLIED BY ITS MASSACHUSETTS THAT'S ALL
MAY I ASK HOW YOU'RE DOING IT I'M CURIOUS
THE ADVANCED SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND ON THE NOBEL PRIZE IN PHYSICS IS HERE AND FOR THE POPULAR SCIENCE BACKGROUND CLICK HERE
I ADMIT I WAS A BIT SURPRISED I THOUGHT A FIGO WIN WAS SORT OF A GIVEN


ACCORDING TO THIS

THEY MAY HAVE MADE THE OFFICIAL DETECTION ANNOUNCEMENT AFTER THE NOMINATION DEADLINE

SHOUCHENG ZHANG AND CHARLIE KANE ARE PROBABLY FEELING PRETTY DISAPPOINTED
ELI
BY THE WAY APS HAS DECIDED TO MAKE SEVERAL KEY PAPERS RELATED TO THIS NOBEL PRIZE FREE TO READ HERE ARE THE FREE PAPERS AND I INCLUDE A SHORT DESCRIPTOR OF THEIR IMPORTANCE

QUANTIZED HALL CONDUCTANCE IN A TWO-DIMENSIONAL PERIODIC POTENTIAL BY THOWLESS KOHMOTO NIGHTINGALE DEN NIAS

THIS IS KNOWN AS THE TANN PAPER AND IT DETAILS HOW TO CALCULATE TOPOLOGICAL INVARIANTS ASSOCIATED WITH BANDS IN BAND THEORY THE ORIGINAL APPLICATION WAS THE INTEGER QUANTUM HALL EFFECT BUT IT APPLIES TO GAPPED TOPOLOGICAL CHERN INSULATORS INCLUDING THE HALDANE MODEL BELOW

MODEL FOR A QUANTUM HALL EFFECT WITHOUT LANDAU LEVELS REALIZATION OF THE PARITY ANOMALY BY HALDANE

THIS INTRODUCED WHAT WE NOW CALL THE HALDANE MODEL WHICH IS BASICALLY AN EARLY VERSION OF A TOPOLOGICAL INSULATOR HALDANE WROTE DOWN THIS MODEL AS A WAY TO ACHIEVE A QUANTIZED HALL CONDUCTIVITY WITHOUT AN EXTERNAL MAGNETIC FIELD BUT UNLIKE THE LATER MODEL MODEL DOES BREAK SYMMETRY RECENTLY THIS MODEL HAS BEEN REALIZED EXPERIMENTALLY

NONLINEAR FIELD THEORY OF HEISENBERG ANTIFERROMAGNET SEMICLASSICALLY QUANTIZED SOLITONS OF THE ONE-DIMENSIONAL NAEL STATE BY HALDANE

THIS INTRODUCED A QUANTUM DESCRIPTION OF SPIN CHAINS SPINS IN INTERACTING VIA THE HEISENBERG MODEL THE S SPIN CHAIN WAS KNOWN TO BE GAPLESS SINCE BETHE SOLVED IT EXACTLY IN THE AND IT WAS ASSUMED THAT THIS BEHAVIOR WOULD PERSIST FOR HIGHER SPIN IN FACT THERE IS A THEOREM THAT IT'S GAPLESS FOR ALL SPIN HALDANE FOUND THAT THE FIELD THEORY CORRESPONDING TO INTEGER SPIN WAS A FIELD THEORY KNOWN TO BE GAPPED DUE TO THE WORK OF POLYAKOV WHILE SPIN CHAINS CONTAIN AN EXTRA TOPOLOGICAL TERM WHICH MAKES THEM GAPLESS THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INTEGER AND SPIN CHAINS BECAME KNOWN AS CONJECTURE BUT IT'S UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED NOW

UNIVERSAL JUMP IN THE SUPERFLUID DENSITY OF TWO-DIMENSIONAL SUPERFLUID BY NELSON AND KOSTERLITZ

IT SEEMS THAT NONE OF THE ORIGINAL PAPERS REVIEWS ON THE KT TRANSITION ARE IN APS JOURNALS BUT THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT PAPER BECAUSE IT SHOWED THAT A SUPERFLUID TRANSITION IN 2D WHICH IS A KT TRANSITION ACQUIRES A UNIVERSAL JUMP IN SUPERFLUID DENSITY AT THE TRANSITION POINT THIS JUMP WAS VERY QUICKLY FOUND IN EXPERIMENTS

QUANTIZED HALL CONDUCTANCE AS A TOPOLOGICAL INVARIANT BY NIU THOWLESS AND WU

THIS IS A GENERALIZATION OF THE TANN RESULT TO SYSTEMS WHICH HAVE DISORDER AND OR INTERACTIONS AND THEREFORE DON'T HAVE A BAND THEORY DESCRIPTION THIS JUSTIFIES THE PRECISE QUANTIZATION OF CONDUCTIVITY IN REAL SYSTEMS
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS IT'S SORT OF AWKWARD TO LUMP BKT TRANSITIONS AND BAND TOPOLOGICAL INSULATORS EDIT I GUESS MORE GENERALLY SYMMETRY PROTECTED TOPOLOGICAL ORDER INTO THE SAME NOBEL PRIZE JUST BECAUSE BOTH PHENOMENA INVOLVE THE WORD TOPOLOGY
HOW BIG WAS THE ROLE THE WINNERS PLAYED IN DEVELOPING TOPOLOGICAL INSULATORS
AND THE GREATEST ARTICLE TITLE GOES TO BRITISH SCIENTISTS WIN NOBEL PRIZE IN PHYSICS FOR WORK SO BAFFLING IT HAS TO BE DESCRIBED USING BAGELS
COULD EXPLAIN WHAT THIS IS EXACTLY
CORRECT ME IF I AM WRONG USING TOPOLOGICAL FEATURES SUCH AS INVARIANCE THE BEHAVIOR OF CONDUCTIVITY OF A THIN SHEET WAS DISCOVERED AND SUBSEQUENTLY IN A CHAIN OF MAGNETS IN SOME MATERIALS NEXT BY THE USE OF TOPOLOGICAL INVARIANCE AND QUANTUM VORTICES IN A LATTICE IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT EXOTIC PHASE TRANSITIONS WERE A POSSIBILITY NOW WE ARE TRYING TO FIND THEM IN 2 OR DIMENSIONS
I HAD THOWLESS FOR AN UNDERGRAD CLASS MANY YEARS AGO
YOU'LL ALL BE SORRY WHEN MY DOOMSDAY ENGINE BREAKS TIME OR YOU'LL NEVER BE EDH I'LL GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT
APPARENTLY DR THOWLESS SUFFERS FROM DEMENTIA AND MAY NOT EVEN REMEMBER HIS WORK VERY SAD
I PREDICTED THIS FOR LAST YEAR
KOSTERLITZ WENT TO MY SCHOOL
THE NOBEL PRIZE IN PHYSICS WAS DIVIDED ONE HALF AWARDED TO DAVID J THOWLESS THE OTHER HALF JOINTLY TO FOLIO DUNCAN MASCULINE HALDANE AND J MICHAEL KOSTERLITZ FOR THEORETICAL DISCOVERIES OF TOPOLOGICAL PHASE TRANSITIONS AND TOPOLOGICAL PHASES OF MATTER

PHYSICS LAUREATES
THE WINNER WAS A PROFESSOR OF ONE MY CURRENT PROFESSORS
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS MORE SIGNIFICANT THIS RESEARCH OR THE FACT THAT NEUTRINOS HAVE MASS THE NOBEL PRIZE AWARDED FOR THIS I THINK ANY THEORETICAL WORK THAT HAS POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS IS THE MOST EXCITING
THAT FUCKING CAMERAMAN
WHEN I FIRST LEARNT ABOUT TOPOLOGICAL INSULATOR I APPARENTLY ASKED HOW COME THIS THING HAS NOT GOTTEN NOBEL YET SOUNDS LIKE I COULD TELL THE FUTURE
I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION THE THING YOU'RE DOING FOR EE DO IT FOR PHYSICS

AS AN ASIDE I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH RESEARCH EXPERIENCE YOU HAVE UNDER YOUR BELT IF YOU DID ANY INTERNSHIPS IN LABS ETC BUT TRY AND GET A BIT OF THAT IN YOUR OWN FIELD FIRST THE WORLD OF RESEARCH AND THE WORLD OF TAUGHT IN BOOKS IS OFTEN UNIVERSES APART THE TRANSITION CAN BE PRETTY TOUGH AND I'VE HAD A LOT OF FRIENDS REALIZE THEY PREFERRED PHYSICS AS A HOBBY THAN A JOB THE HARD WAY
WITH YOUR REMAINING TIME IN UNIVERSITY SEE IF YOU CAN TAKE A CLASS IN QUANTUM MECHANICS AND ONE IN ADVANCED CLASSICAL MECHANICS AS ELECTIVES

THEN APPLY TO GRADUATE PROGRAMS IN PHYSICS YOUR EE BACKGROUND SHOULD COVER A LOT OF GROUND
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN STUDYING QUANTUM MECHANICS INDEPENDENTLY I CANNOT RECOMMEND DR BOOK HIGHLY ENOUGH YOU CAN PROBABLY FIND IT IN YOUR UNIVERSITY LIBRARY IT HELPS TO HAVE A SOLID UNDERSTANDING OF LINEAR ALGEBRA AND BUT HIS APPROACH TO QM USING PHOTON POLARIZATION RATHER THAN JUST THROWING SCHRODINGER AT YOU IS PRETTY NOVEL AND I THINK MAKES LEARNING THE TERMINOLOGY SO MUCH EASIER
THERE'S THIS NIFTY SITE BY THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNER GERARD T HOOF ON THIS VERY SUBJECT

HOW TO BECOME A GOOD THEORETICAL PHYSICIST

I CANNOT VOUCH FOR ITS QUALITY AS I HAVEN'T FOLLOWED IT MYSELF BUT IT LISTS SUBJECTS THAT HE THINKS THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW AND HAS SOME LINKS TO DOCUMENTS YOU CAN USE TO STUDY THEM
AS AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER YOU HAVE SKILLS THAT ARE INVALUABLE FOR DESIGNING AND CONSTRUCTING RESEARCH PROJECTS I WOULD SUGGEST LEVERAGING THAT IF YOU CAN WORK ON PHYSICS RESEARCH PROJECTS IN AN ENGINEERING CAPACITY YOU'D BE RUBBING SHOULDERS WITH PROFESSIONAL PHYSICISTS AND YOU'D BE IMMERSED IN IT ALL THE TIME

EDIT IN RESPONSE TO THE THEORETICAL PHYSICIST PART MMMM THAT'S A TRICKY ONE READ THE FUCK OUT OF BOOKS AND GET REALLY GOOD AT MATHEMATICS
HERE'S A LINK TO THE AMERICAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY APS WITH MORE GUIDANCE

IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE A RESEARCH PHYSICIST YOU SHOULD CONSIDER RECEIVING AN ADVANCED DEGREE IN PHYSICS START LOOKING AT TO GRADUATE PROGRAMS IN PHYSICS A GOOD PLACE TO START IS GRADSCHOOLSHOPPER AND SEE IF THEY HAVE RESEARCH YOU ARE INTERESTED IN IF YOU IN YOUR FINAL YEAR OF YOUR EARNING YOUR BA YOU NEED TO START APPLYING NOW SOME APPLICATIONS ARE ALREADY DUE YOU'LL NEED TO TAKE THE PHYSICS GRE WHICH YOU USUALLY SHOULD STUDY FOR AND THE STANDARD GRE FOR MOST INSTITUTIONS ADMISSIONS TO THESE PROGRAMS ARE USUAL BASED ON YOUR UNDERGRADUATE RECORD YOUR RESEARCH EXPERIENCE AND ANY PUBLICATIONS AND THEN YOUR PHYSICS GRE SCORE OFCOURSE SOME INSTITUTIONS ARE MORE COMPETITIVE THAN OTHERS THE TYPICAL SUGGESTION IS A LEAST APPLY SCHOOLS 2 REACH SCHOOLS WERE YOU WOULD LOVE TO GO BUT WILL PROBABLY BE LUCKY TO GET IN 2 SCHOOLS YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WOULD HAVE FAIR CHANCE AT ACCEPTANCE AND THEN 2 FALLBACK SCHOOLS THAT YOU ARE CERTAIN WOULD YOU COULD EASILY GET INTO WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM AND WOULD BE OKAY WITH GOING TO AND THEN APPLY TO SOME MORE

A WARNING WITH THEORETICAL PHYSICS RESEARCH YOU WILL NEED A STRONG MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND AND YOU SHOULD BE PREPARED TO FIND FUNDING TIGHTER THAN THE EXPERIMENTAL SIDE

MOST JOBS IN PURE RESEARCH WITH EITHER BE IN ACADEMIA OR NATIONAL LABS AND FEWER IN INDUSTRY
I DESPISE THESE TITLES STRANGE MATTER EXOTIC MATTER HERE'S WHAT A SPIN LIQUID MATERIAL LOOKS LIKE

WIKI HERBERTSMITHITE MEDIA FILE

THESE TITLES MAKE IT SOUND LIKE IT'S A SOUP OR SOMETHING COULD SCIENCE JOURNALIST PUT AT LEAST THE TINIEST BIT OF EFFORT HOW ABOUT AT LEAST EXOTIC MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OR STRANGE MAGNETISM OR SOMETHING

I THINK YOUR QUESTION IS WHY CURRENT IS USED AS THE BASE UNIT INSTEAD OF CHARGE WHICH U PUMMEL DOESN'T ANSWER ALTHOUGH HE IS RIGHT THAT ONE CAN BE DEFINED IN TERMS OF THE OTHER YOU WOULD STILL EXPECT THAT CHARGE WOULD BE MORE THE FUNDAMENTAL CHOICE THAT WE WOULD PREFER FOR THE BASE UNIT

THE REASON WHY CURRENT WAS CHOSEN IS OPERATIONAL CURRENT IS MEASURED WITH AN AMMETER A VERY SIMPLE AND ACCURATE DEVICE WHICH WAS ALREADY WIDELY AVAILABLE IN THE LATE WHEN THE SI UNITS WERE BEING FINALIZED EVEN BASIC LABORATORIES WERE EQUIPPED WITH ACCURATE AMMETERS

BUT MEASURING STATIC ELECTRICITY CHARGE ITSELF IS A FAR MORE COMPLICATED TASK THERE WAS NO SIMPLE DEVICE THAT COULD TELL YOU HOW MANY COULOMBS YOU HAD CHARGE WAS USUALLY MEASURED INDIRECTLY WITH A MORE COMPLICATED AND INACCURATE APPARATUS

WITH THIS IN MIND CHOICE TO MAKE THE AMPERE A BASE UNIT AND THE COULOMB A DERIVED UNIT IS PERFECTLY SENSIBLE
PLEASE USE GOOGLE AND PLEASE GO TO ASK PHYSICS
THE AIM OF THE SI BASE UNIT IS TO BE ABLE TO EXPRESS THE UNIT OF ANY PHYSICAL QUANTITY WITH AS LESS DIFFERENT UNITS AS POSSIBLE THE UNIT OF THE CHARGE CAN BE EXPRESSED FROM THE UNIT OF THE CURRENT AND THE UNIT OF TIME C A SOUTH THEREFORE ADDING THE COULOMB IN THE SI BASE UNIT WOULD BE REDUNDANT HOWEVER WE COULD IMAGINE ANOTHER SYSTEM OF UNITS THAT WOULD REPLACE THE AMPERE BY THE COULOMB AS A BASIC UNIT IT'S AN ARBITRARY CHOICE
LINK

ABS
WHY NOT BOTH BOTH GO VERY WELL TOGETHER ISN'T DOUBLE MAJORING ALLOWED IN SWEDEN

ALSO AND THIS MAY BE SLIGHTLY DISAPPOINTING BUT UH PHYSICS IN POP CULTURE IS PRETTY MUCH ALL FLUFF THE MATH IMO IS THE BEST PART FOR ME IT IS SUCH A GOOD FEELING WHEN YOU LEARN HOW CERTAIN THINGS CONNECT BUT THAT TAKES EFFORT PREPARE FOR SAID EFFORT


YOUR ODDS OF GETTING A JOB IN PHYSICS DEPENDS HEAVILY ON WHAT FIELD YOU'RE INTERESTED IN AND THAT'S SOMETHING YOU WON'T FIGURE OUT RIGHT AWAY IF YOU'RE ONLY INTERESTED IN WORKING AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF RESEARCH YOUR ODDS AREN'T GREAT THERE'S ONLY ONE EINSTEIN OR FEYNMAN BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU SHOULD GIVE UP THERE'S TONS OF OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE EXCITING AT ALL LEVELS

I'M ONE OF THE RARE UNICORNS THAT GOT A JOB AS A PHYSICIST IN INDUSTRY WITH ONLY A BS THOUGH I'M NOW WORKING ON MY MS PART TIME ABOUT RD OF THE TIME I WORK JUST LIKE AN ENGINEER WRITING CODE OR WHATEVER NEEDS TO BE DONE I DOUBT THERE ARE MANY PHYSICS JOBS AT ALL TODAY THAT DON'T FREQUENTLY INTERSECT WITH COMPUTER SCIENCE THERE'S TONS OF WORK FOR SOLVING COMPLEX EQUATIONS OR MODELING PHYSICAL INTERACTIONS THAT REQUIRE A STRONG BACKGROUND IN BOTH FIELDS

MY ADVICE IS TO TRY SOME OF BOTH I PERSONALLY ENJOY COMPUTER SCIENCE BUT ONLY WHEN IT HAS A PHYSICAL CONNECTION SIGN ME UP TO SIMULATE A RADIATION DETECTOR OR ANALYZE DATA BUT DON'T EVER EXPECT ME TO DESIGN A WEBSITE OR WRITE A COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL IT'S ALL PERSONAL PREFERENCE IT'S ALSO DEFINITELY POSSIBLE TO GET A JOB AS AN ENGINEER WITH A PHYSICS DEGREE AS LONG AS YOU HAVE THE SKILLS THEY'RE LOOKING FOR I'VE WORKED WITH SEVERAL PEOPLE THAT DID THIS INCLUDING AN OLD BOSS
I WOULD SAY SWITCH TO COMPESCE THERE'S NOT MUCH POINT IN PHYSICS IF YOU DON'T ENJOY SOLVING PROBLEMS AND DOING EXPERIMENTS
SOMEONE WITH A CS DEGREE WITH A GOOD GROUNDING IN MATH AND PHYSICS IS HIGHLY DESIRED AND YOU'LL BE IN A GREAT POSITION TO PICK AND CHOOSE THE JOBS AND WORK YOU DO ALSO THE TYPES OF PROBLEMS YOU WILL GET TO SOLVE ARE FAR MORE INTERESTING AND REWARDING

QUALIFIED PHYSICIST WITH COMPUTER KNOWLEDGE ARE THINK ON THE GROUND THE CHANCES OF HAVING OFFERS FOR WORK AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO TURN DOWN ONES THAT DON'T INTEREST YOU WILL BE FAR LESS IF ANY
I TALKED TO A PROFESSOR RECENTLY THOUGH AFTER HE GAVE A SEMINAR HE STARTED OUT IN ENGINEERING AND ENDED UP DOING COMPUTER MODELLING IN FLUID MECHANICS AS PART OF THE MATHEMATICS DEPARTMENT I ASKED HOW HE CAN JUST SWAP HE REPLIED THAT ALL OF THE DISCIPLINES ARE INTERCONNECTED IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM IN SOME OTHER DISCIPLINE THAT YOU WANT TO TACKLE YOU JUST DO IT IF YOU CAN LEARN PHYSICS YOU CAN LEARN OTHER THINGS TOO EVEN ELON MUSK STARTED WITH A PHYSICS DEGREE BUT HE IS TECHNICALLY AN ENGINEER AND HE CLEARLY SPENT SOME TIME LEARNING BUSINESS AND CODING IT IS VERY COMMON FROM WHAT I CAN TELL

ONE OF THE WAYS I SEE IT LATELY IS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE AN ENDORAL THERE IS A WIDE SET OF DISCIPLINES THAT WILL FIT INTO IT FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WANT TO BE AN ASTRONAUT THERE IS A BROAD AND FAIRLY WELL DEFINED SET OF SKILLS THAT YOU START TO WORK TOWARDS RUSSIAN LANGUAGE MEDICINE BIOMED SPELUNKERING DIVING ROBOTICS AND ENGINEERING ELECTRONICS SCIENCE ANY FIELD SOME OF THEM ARE REQUIRED TO PERFORM EXPERIMENTS IN MICROGRAVITY AND SUCH AND AVIATION

BLDR

AS WITH MANY THINGS IN LIFE IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WITH ALL OF IT
ALSO YOU SHOULD BROADEN YOUR HORIZONS THERE IS LOTS OF INTERESTING PHYSICS RESEARCH BESIDES PARTICLE HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS LIKE WHAT IS GOING ON AT LOC AND MOSTLY ON BLACKBOARDS COMPUTER SCREENS FAR AWAY FROM LOC ITSELF OF COURSE YOU COULD SAY THE VERY FRONTIER OF UNDERSTANDING THE WORLD AROUND US IS IN THAT FIELD OF PHYSICS BUT IT DOES NOT MEAN THERE IS NOTHING GOING ON IN THE REST OF PHYSICS

IT IS NOT MY IMPRESSION THAT YOU HAVE TO BE EXTREMELY INTELLIGENT TO PURSUE A CAREER IN PHYSICS HARD WORK WORKS AS WELL ALSO BEING FLEXIBLE IS VERY IMPORTANT YOU COULD DO YOUR BACHELOR MASTER AND PHD IN THE SAME PLACE SAY NEAR YOUR HOME TOWN BUT THEN MOST CERTAINLY YOU NEED TO MOVE TO A FEW DIFFERENT PLACES TO GET POSTHOC POSITIONS PREFERABLY ABROAD SO MAKE SURE TO GET A FLEXIBLE GIRLFRIEND BOYFRIEND QUITE A FEW PEOPLE QUIT ACADEMIA AFTER THEIR PHD BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO MOVE ABROAD OR AWAY TO GET POSTHOC POSITIONS MAYBE THEY HAVE A PARTNER WITH A JOB WHERE THEY CURRENTLY ARE OR THEY'VE BOUGHT A HOUSE ETC
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE OR HOW I CAN ACCESS WORK ON FARADAY ROTATION I'M HAVING A LOT OF TROUBLE FINDING HIS PUBLICATIONS ON THE PHENOMENON
I'M READING BOOK ON QM AND THERE THE COMMUTATION RELATION F CLASSICAL POISSON BRACKETS IS USED TO SET THE MOMENTUM POSITION OPERATORS RELATION IN QM THIS SEEMS LIKE A HUGE LEAP TO ME THE ARGUMENT THAT THE BEHAVIOR SHOULD GIVE THE CLASSICAL LIMIT CAN IMPLY TONS OF DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH DIFFERENT COMMUTATION RELATIONS COULD GIVE SAME CLASSICAL BEHAVIOR IN SOME COMPLICATED PROCESSES AS YOU GO FROM QUANTUM TO CLASSICAL ESPECIALLY SINCE THAT REQUIRES MANY PARTICLES AND SO ON THE ARGUMENT SEEMS VERY NON RIGOROUS WHILE PRETENDING TO BE AM I WRONG IN THINKING THIS
HOW LONG SHOULD A INTERVIEW VISIT TAKE WITH A GRADUATE SCHOOL I AM TAKING A BIG TRIP AND I'M VISITING SEVERAL GRAD SCHOOLS ALONG THE WAY I WANT TO KNOW HOW LONG I SHOULD EXPECT TO BE AT EACH SCHOOL SO I CAN PLAN MY TRIP
OK I'VE GOT SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT TIME

IF TIME CAN BE SLOWED BY GRAVITY AND SPEED RELATIVITY WHY WOULDN'T THE BIG BANG HAVE HAPPENED SLOWLY KNOWING THAT ALL OF THE UNIVERSES MASS EXISTED IN A SINGLE POINT WOULDN'T IT HAVE HAD THE GRAVITY TO SLOW TIME AND THEREFORE TAKE REALLY LONG TO EXPAND UNTIL OF COURSE THE MASS SPREAD OUT ENOUGH TO SPEED UP AND THEN ONCE EXPANDING SO FAST SLOW TIME BACK DOWN AGAIN

QUESTION 2

IF I COULD STOP TIME WOULDN'T EVERY ATOM AROUND ME HAVE TO STOP MOVING THEREFOR STOP PRODUCING EM ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES AND EVERYTHING WOULD DROP TO A TEMPERATURE OF ABSOLUTE ZERO
WOULD THIS MEAN ANYTHING IN THE ENVIRONMENT OF ABSOLUTE ZERO WOULD REALLY BE FROZEN IN TIME THINKING THAT IT'S ATOMS CAN'T MOVE AND NOTHING CAN CHANGE REALLY IT WOULD SEEM LIKE NO TIME WOULD PASS IN ITS RELATIVE PERSPECTIVE ANYWAY HAS IT BEEN FROZEN IN TIME

AND LAST ONE
IF TIME SLOWS DOWN NEAR A LARGE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE AND LIGHT REMAINS AT THE SAME SPEED WHY HASN'T IT'S DISTANCE TRAVELED CHANGED IT SHOULD COVER THE SAME DISTANCE IN LESS TIME THEREFORE CREATING AND INCREASE OF SPEED RIGHT S T
DOES ANYONE KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND GENERAL RELATIVITY AREN'T THEY BOTH ABOUT HOW GRAVITY WARPS SPACETIME
IF I'M WANTING TO PROBABLY GO INTO SOME INDUSTRY JOB HOPEFULLY IN PHYSICS IS A THEORETICAL PROJECT A GOOD IDEA OR SHOULD I DO SOMETHING MORE EXPERIMENTAL
ARE THE SUGAT EQUATIONS NOT USABLE AT UNDERGRADUATE LEVEL

I STARTED MY ASTROPHYSICS DEGREE A FEW WEEKS AGO AND WHEN BEING TAUGHT THE EQUATIONS OF UNIFORM MOTION THEY LOOKED COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TO HOW THEY'D BEEN TAUGHT TO ME PREVIOUSLY AS THE SUGAT EQUATIONS IS THERE A MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO SETS OF EQUATIONS
I WAS READING THESIS AND WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT MEASUREMENT HE DESCRIBES TWO QUANTUM SYSTEMS A B INTERACTING IN SUCH A WAY THAT A CORRELATION BETWEEN THEM BECOMES STRONGER AS TIME GOES TO INFINITY

BUT WHEN I LOOK AT THE SCHROEDINGER EQUATION OR ANY OTHER SIMILAR WAVE EQUATION AND ASSUME THAT THE FREQUENCY BASIS IS FINITE THEN IT SEEMS LIKE THE TIME EVOLUTION OF THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE ROUGHLY PERIODIC IN OTHER WORDS THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME KIND OF RETURN TO A STATE THAT'S CLOSE TO THE INITIAL STATE IF THE FREQUENCIES ARE IRRATIONAL RELATIVE TO EACH OTHER IT TURNS INTO A SORT OF LONELY RUNNER PROBLEM

IS THERE ANY WORK THAT ELABORATES OR GOES INTO MORE DETAIL ABOUT THE DYNAMICS OF MEASUREMENT AS INTERPRETED IN THE MANY WORLDS INTERPRETATION
HOW DO PHYSICISTS FEEL ABOUT MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS I'M CURIOUS IF IT'S MORE ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT THESE MATHEMATICIANS ARE DOING IS REALLY HELPFUL OR THESE GUYS ARE WASTING THEIR TIME WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THE EQUATIONS WE USE WORK
THAT LOOKS REALLY INTERESTING IF IT HELPS FOR PEOPLE INTIMIDATED BY THE LENGTH THE LAST PAGES ARE REFERENCES
THANKS FOR THE INFO I AM THINKING OF SUBMITTING MY OWN
SEAN CAROL IS EVERYWHERE THESE DAYS GOOD FOR HIM I LOVE THAT GUY
HOW ON EARTH DO THEY REALLY KNOW ANY OF THIS
I DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT VIDEO WAS PARTICULARLY INFORMATIVE FOR HOW LONG I SPENT ON IT
I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT TO SAY THAT THE EXISTENCE OF STARS AND GALAXIES DEPENDS ON THE PROPERTIES OF NOTHINGNESS EMPTY SPACE BECAUSE EMPTY SPACE IS NOT IN FACT NOTHINGNESS THAT'S WHAT THE WHOLE ABOUT
THE CURRENT ASTRONOMICAL THEORIES SOUND TO ME LIKE TRYING TO EXPLAIN WHY THE PLANETS MOVE IN SUCH FUNNY LOOPS WHILE MAINTAINING THAT THE EARTH MUST BE THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE

IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING REALLY FUCKING OBVIOUS WE'RE JUST NOT GETTING
LAWRENCE KRAUSS TALKS ABOUT THIS TOO

AT THE RISK OF TALKING OUT MY BUTT PER MISUNDERSTANDING
NET ENERGY OF UNIVERSE IS ZERO BEING A UNIVERSE WHERE MATTER IS POSITIVE ENERGY AND GRAVITY IS NEGATIVE ENERGY

AT THE RISK OF GETTING PHILOSOPHICAL
THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO EXPLAIN THAT SOMETHING EXISTS IF IT SPEWS FROM NOTHINGNESS IN A BALANCED INFINITE WAY I EAST ANYTHING THAT CAN EXIST MUST EXISTS ELSE NOTHING WOULD EXIST

AT THE RISK OF SOUNDING NITPICKY
IT BUGS ME IN VIDEOS LIKE THIS WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT THE UNIVERSE IN TERMS OF SIZE BECAUSE IT PRESUMES OR IMPLIES FINITE
DIDN'T DIRAC THEORIZE SOMETHING FROM NOTHING THEORY THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A TRUE VACUUM
UNLIMITED NEGATIVE POTENTIAL ENERGY
YOU CAN'T GET SOMETHING FROM NOTHING NOTHING IS A CONCEPT IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY EXIST THE UNIVERSE IS CREATED FROM ENERGY FREQUENCIES AND VIBRATIONS ALL PHYSICAL MATTER WHEN LOOKED AT MUCH CLOSER IS MADE UP MORE OF WAVEFORM ENERGY THAN IT IS PHYSICAL MATTER

THE UNIVERSE OR WHAT I WOULD RATHER TERM AS EXISTENCE BECAUSE IT IS MORE ENCOMPASSING IS CREATED BY CONSCIOUSNESS WE CREATE IT THROUGH INTENTION IF YOU CAN'T GRASP THIS IT IS OK THERE IS NO WAY TO DESCRIBE IT IN A COLD SCIENTIFIC MANNER SECULAR SCIENCE IS ABOUT TO RUN INTO A WALL IF IT DOESN'T ADAPT

QUANTUM PHYSICS IS GETTING CLOSER TO THE NATURE OF REALITY
I'M QUITE BIASED I USE MATHEMATIC ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY AND I ALMOST NEVER TOUCH MATALAN LIKE YOUR FRIEND MY WORK IS THEORETICAL

I THINK THAT MATHEMATIC IS FAR AND AWAY THE MORE USEFUL PROGRAM IT JUST DOES MORE THINGS FOR SYMBOLIC MANIPULATIONS THERE'S JUST NO COMPARISON IT'S BASICALLY ALL EASIER TO DO IN MATHEMATIC ALTHOUGH MAPLE DOES HAVE SOME ADVANTAGES HERE FOR NUMERICAL CALCULATIONS THE FEATURE SETS ARE MOSTLY COMPARABLE PEOPLE THINK MATALAN IS FASTER IN THIS DEPARTMENT BUT I DISAGREE AND I'LL EXPLAIN WHY LATER THEN WITH MATHEMATIC YOU GET ALL KINDS OF ADDED EXTRA STUFF SOME OF WHICH IS IN MATALAN AND SOME ISN'T OPERATIONS NATIVE SUPPORT FOR NEURAL NETWORKS PATTERN MATCHING AND REPLACEMENT IN EXPRESSIONS LAZY EVALUATION BUILT-IN OPERATOR OVERLOADING EXACT CALCULATIONS COMPILING PROGRAMS TO C AUTOMATIC TRACKING OF ACCURACY PRECISION AND MANY MORE FEATURES

HERE'S A LIST OF SOME OF THE BIGGER THINGS I'VE DONE IN MATHEMATIC ALTHOUGH THEY'RE ALL SMALL COMPARED TO A COMMERCIAL CODE BASE A PROGRAM TO DISCRETIVE AND SOLVE A LINEAR SINGULAR INTEGRAL EQUATION A NEURAL NETWORK TO CLASSIFY MAIST DIGITS I DID THIS BEFORE WOLFRAM ADDED NATIVE NEURAL NETWORK SUPPORT A NUMERICAL COMPUTATION OF THE RATIO FOR CERTAIN QUANTUM OPTICS MODELS AND AN ALGORITHM TO GENERATE ALL THE TOPOLOGICALLY INEQUIVALENT VACUUM FEYNMAN DIAGRAMS FOR AN ARBITRARY SCALAR FIELD THEORY

THERE ARE HOWEVER A NUMBER OF FRUSTRATING ASPECTS OF MATHEMATIC

BUGS AND REGRESSION ARE A BIG PROBLEM MATALAN IS A MORE STABLE PLATFORM WOLFRAM IS ALWAYS ADDING NEW FUNCTIONALITY TO MATHEMATIC THAT'S GREAT WHEN IT BRINGS NEW FEATURES RELEVANT TO YOUR WORK BUT IT'S TERRIBLE WHEN IT BREAKS OLD ONES THAT YOU WERE USING FOR EVERY MAJOR NEW NUMBERED RELEASE YOU CAN ALWAYS EXPECT THAT CERTAIN ROUTINES WILL GET SLOWER CERTAIN INTEGRALS WILL NOW GIVE INCORRECT ANSWERS ETC SO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO GUARD AGAINST THESE THINGS BY ANSWERS WHERE POSSIBLE AND MAINTAINING MULTIPLE VERSIONS THERE ARE BUGS IN THE INTEGRATION ALGORITHM THAT HAVE EXISTED LARGELY UNCHANGED SINCE MATHEMATIC OR THE RECENT VERSION RELEASE SLOWED DOWN SOME OPERATIONS ON MATRICES LARGER THAN ABOUT X BY A FACTOR OF LIKE THIS STUFF GETS FIXED LATER IN MINOR RELEASES BUT IT'S ANNOYING TO HAVE THINGS BREAK AND THEN HAVE TO WAIT

I THINK THE BIGGEST REASON PEOPLE PREFER MATALAN THOUGH IS BECAUSE THE SYNTAX IS EASIER AND WRITING EFFICIENT CODE IS CLOSER TO WHAT THEY ARE USED TO THE SYNTAX OF MATALAN ISN'T TOO FAR FROM C OR PYTHON MATHEMATIC IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PARADIGM IF YOU TAKE MATALAN CODE WRITTEN IN THE USUAL PROCEDURAL STYLE USING CONTROL LOOPS ITERATING OVER ELEMENTS ETC YOU CAN PORT IT EASILY TO MATHEMATIC BUT USUALLY IT WILL BE QUITE SLOW THIS CONTRIBUTES TO THE PERCEPTION THAT MATHEMATIC IS MUCH SLOWER THAN MATALAN AT LINEAR ALGEBRA FOR EXAMPLE TO GET THE SPEED OUT OF MATHEMATIC YOU HAVE TO BECOME GOOD AT IMPLEMENTING FUNCTIONAL STYLE USING REAP AND SOW TO CREATE ARRAYS PASSING VECTORS AND MATRICES TO FUNCTIONS DIRECTLY RATHER THAN CALLING THEIR ELEMENTS ALWAYS WRITING THINGS AS MATRIX MULTIPLICATION AND DOT PRODUCTS WHERE POSSIBLE RATHER THAN CALLING ELEMENTS ETC USING COMPILE TO TREAT VARIABLES AS NUMERICAL NOT USING ARBITRARY PRECISION WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO IN MATALAN I THINK IF YOU WRITE IT'S TREATED AS A DOUBLE WHEREAS IN MATHEMATIC IT'S HAS ARBITRARY PRECISION ETC IT'S A BIG SHIFT IN HOW YOU WRITE YOUR CODE AND IT REQUIRES A LOT OF CARE ON THE PART OF THE PROGRAMMER TO LEARN NEW EFFICIENT HABITS THIS IS USUALLY WHY IF YOU DO ANY KIND OF NAIVE SPEED TEST YOU FIND MATHEMATIC IS MUCH SLOWER THAN MATALAN

ULTIMATELY I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH EXPERIENCE USING MATALAN FOR THE THINGS IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD AT TO TELL SOMEONE ELSE TO SWITCH TO MATHEMATIC BUT FOR ME EVERY TIME I THINK I NEED TO GO OUT AND USE SOME OTHER PROGRAM I END UP FIGURING OUT HOW TO DO IT IN MATHEMATIC WITH GOOD RESULTS SO FAR
MATALAN IS SUPERIOR FOR NUMERICAL METHODS SIMULATIONS DATA ANALYSIS AND HIGH-LEVEL PROGRAMMING MATHEMATIC CAN DO ALL THOSE THINGS BUT IF YOU ASKED PEOPLE THAT HAVE USED BOTH EXTENSIVELY I'M CONFIDENT TO WOULD TELL YOU MATALAN IS SUPERIOR FOR THOSE TASKS

MATHEMATIC IS SUPERIOR FOR ANY KIND OF ANALYTICAL WORK SYMBOLIC MANIPULATION ANALYSIS ETC COMPARED TO MATHEMATIC MATALAN IS WOEFULLY INADEQUATE BY COMPARISON MATALAN DOES HAVE A SYMBOLIC MATH TOOLBOX COSTS EXTRA OF COURSE BUT IT'S NOWHERE NEAR AS POWERFUL AS MATHEMATIC AND IT DOESN'T INTEGRATE VERY WELL WITH THE REST OF MATALAN IMHO

SO IT REALLY DEPENDS WHAT KIND OF CALCULATIONS YOU WILL NEED TO DO
THE ANSWERS SEEM TO PRETTY MUCH CONTRADICT EACH OTHER MATALAN IS BETTER MATHEMATIC IS BETTER THEY'RE BOTH THE SAME

IN MY OPINION YOU SHOULDN'T BE COMPARING THE TWO THEY'RE DIFFERENT SOFTWARE WITH DIFFERENT PURPOSES YOU SHOULD KNOW HOW TO USE BOTH IN AT LEAST A BASIC CAPACITY AS WELL AS A FASTER LANGUAGE SUCH AS FORTRAN OR C

MATHEMATIC I USE FOR SYMBOLICS AND THINGS SUITED FOR FUNCTIONAL MATALAN I USE FOR DATA ANALYSIS AND PRODUCING A QUICK VERY CONFIGURABLE PLOT OF A FUNCTION AND SOMETIMES EVEN A QUICK SIMULATION FORTRAN I USE FOR SIMULATIONS THAT TAKE HOURS TO FINISH
HONESTLY BOTH ARE GOOD FOR DIFFERENT THINGS THERE'S OBVIOUSLY SOME OVERLAP BUT EACH IS A POWERFUL TOOL I TURN TO MATALAN WHENEVER I HAVE PROBLEMS THAT INVOLVE MATRIX ALGEBRA AND I TURN TO MATHEMATIC WHENEVER I AM DOING MORE PROBLEMS INTEGRALS DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS ETC I ALSO TURN TO MATALAN WHENEVER I WANT TO WRITE IN CODE BECAUSE IT'S A LANGUAGE THAT'S EASIER TO WORK WITH THAN SAY C WHICH MAKES IT PERFECT FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH THAT BEING SAID IT'S NOT THE FASTEST LANGUAGE AT ALL C AND FORTRAN ARE FASTER BUT IT'S GOOD FOR WHEN YOU WANT TO WRITE A PROGRAM THAT DOESN'T TAKE MORE THAN A FEW HOURS TO RUN

I THINK YOUR FRIEND WHO THINKS MATHEMATIC IS THE ONLY WAY IS MISSING OUT ON THE BENEFITS OF MATALAN I USE MATALAN MORE THAN MATHEMATIC AND I'M MORE COMFORTABLE WITH MATALAN HOWEVER I UNDERSTAND HOW USEFUL MATHEMATIC CAN BE IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS

SO IN SUMMARY IT'S LARGELY A MATTER OF PREFERENCE I THINK MATALAN IS EASIER TO WORK WITH BUT I'D BE A FOOL TO CLAIM MATHEMATIC IS USELESS TO ME
DIFFERENT TOOLS FOR DIFFERENT JOBS

PERSONALLY I USE MATALAN A LOT MORE MAINLY FOR ANALYZING EXPERIMENTAL DATA AND FOR GENERATING NUMERIC SIMULATIONS SOLUTIONS BUT WHEN I'M DOING MORE ANALYTIC STUFF I'LL USE MAPLE
I THINK YOU'RE COMPARING APPLES TO ORANGES MATALAN AND MATHEMATIC ARE DIFFERENT THINGS MATHEMATIC IS FOR SOLVING MATH PROBLEMS ESPECIALLY ANALYTIC ONES MATALAN IS A SCRIPTING PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE THAT IS GOOD AT MATRIX OPERATIONS
AS AN EXPERIMENTALIST I CAN SCRIPT SHIT IN MATALAN TO THEN RUN AN EXPERIMENT EFFECTIVELY WITH THE PRESS OF A BUTTON MINUS CODING TIME MAYBE YOU COULD DO THIS IN MATHEMATIC BUT I THINK IT IS PROBABLY MORE ANNOYING HARDER ALSO I HAVE FOUND MATALAN FAR MORE USEFUL FOR ANALYZING REAL DATA SETS EASY TO IMPORT MANIPULATE DATA UNLIKE MY EXPERIENCES DOING THE SAME IN MATHEMATIC
MATHEMATIC IS A GREAT TOOL FOR THEORY BUT MATALAN IS FAR SUPERIOR FOR EXPERIMENTAL APPLICATIONS
KIND OF INTERESTING BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE THE PROBLEM SWITCHED INSTEAD OF WORRYING HOW TO TURN ASTROPHYSICISTS INTO SOFTWARE ENGINEERS WHY NOT TURN SOFTWARE ENGINEERS INTO ASTROPHYSICISTS SOME ACADEMIC LABS ACTUALLY ALLOCATE FUNDS FOR SOFTWARE ENGINEERS AND I'M SURE SOFTWARE ENGINEERS WOULD LOVE TO JOIN TEAMS AND LEARN ABOUT ASTROPHYSICS EEE WHY DON'T LABS MAKE MORE OF AN EFFORT TO HIRE SOFTWARE ENGINEERS TO WORK ON PROBLEMS

I'M DEVELOPING THEORIES FOR NEURAL NETWORKS IN ORDER TO USE THEM FOR SIMULATIONS OF SCANNED HUMAN BRAINS IN A COMPUTER YES IT NOT ONLY SOUNDS FUCKING AWESOME IT IS ALSO CRAZY BLACK MAGIC
LAST MONTH TO FINISH MY BACHELOR THESIS TOO BAD THAT MY NUMERICAL RESULTS STILL WILDLY OSCILLATE ALL THE WAY UP AND DOWN IT'S AS IF SEVERAL TERMS SHOULD CANCEL BUT THEY DON'T
LITERATURE REVIEW A BIT OF CODING FOR MY UNDERGRADUATE THESIS AND GENERATING A LIST OF GRADUATE PROGRAMS I'M INTERESTED IN
WORKING ON A POSTER FOR THE FALL AGU MEETING TO PRESENT MY GROUP FINDINGS FROM OUR ARCTIC RESEARCH

2 READING PAPERS ON ENTANGLEMENT AND ASSOCIATED PHENOMENA FOR A STUDY BEGINNING IN THE SPRING
FINISHING OFF A PAPER ON MY SUMMER RESEARCH AND DOING SOME READING TO CHOSE A PROJECT TO WORK ON FOR MY MASTERS IN GRAVITATIONAL WAVES FROM BINARY BLACK HOLE MERGERS THINKING ABOUT WORKING ON PHENOMENOLOGY PARTICULAR DEDUCING THE SPIN OF THE BLACK HOLES FROM THE WAVEFORM AS I THINK ITS PRETTY BADASS THAT ITS POSSIBLE TO DO THAT
STUDYING FOR MY FIRST THERMAL PHYSICS EXAM HAVING THE NATURAL LOG RULES MEMORIZED IS THE MAIN THING HOLDING ME BACK
JUST STARTED WITH CLASSICAL MECHANICS AND CALCULUS IN UNI MY ACTUAL MAJOR IS COMPUTER SCIENCE WHICH I DID LAST YEAR BUT I'M SWITCHING MAJORS AS SOON AS I CAN
CALCULUS EXAM ON FRIDAY

FINISHING OFF RELATIVISTIC MECHANICS GETTING INTO THE DYNAMICS OF ROTATIONAL MOTION AND BRAINSTORMING FOR A PROJECT ON INTERPLANETARY ORBIT TRANSFER I'M A NEWBIE FIRST YEAR STUDENT
MESSING AROUND WITH IMAGE FOR TEM IMAGES AND TELLING MYSELF THAT I SHOULD COMMIT THE ENTIRE WEEKEND TO STUDYING FOR E M AND THERMAL
I WOULD SUGGEST LOOKING INTO DOING PHS IN EU NA NOT BECAUSE OF ARTICLE BUT BECAUSE IT'D BE AN ENRICHING REWARDING AND EXCITING THING TO DO THAT BEING SAID MY PURELY SPECULATIVE AND ENTIRELY UNINFORMED OPINION IS THAT ARTICLE WILL HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON UK SCIENCE ESPECIALLY SOME OF THE MORE BLUE SKIES STUFF
IT'S TOO DIFFICULT TO SAY A LOT OF PEOPLE INDEED THINK SCIENCE FUNDING WILL DETERIORATE IN THE UK BUT LET'S BE HONEST HERE I DON'T THINK ANYONE CAN SAY THAT AT THIS POINT AT LEAST NOT WITH ENOUGH CERTAINTY FOR YOU TO BASE A MAJOR LIFE DECISION ON

THAT BEING SAID IT MIGHT BE WORTH EMIGRATING TO THE EU SOON BECAUSE ALL UK CITIZENS ALREADY LIVING THERE WILL PROBABLY BE GRANTED PERMANENT RESIDENCE AND SIMILARLY FOR EU CITIZENS IN THE UK
WHILE I'M STILL AN UNDERGRADUATE MYSELF I'VE DONE AN INTERNSHIP FOR HALF A YEAR IN THE US FROM THE NETHERLANDS HERE AND IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE

I CAN'T GIVE YOU ANY ADVICE REGARDING ARTICLE AND WHATNOT AS NO ONE WILL REALLY BE ABLE TO TELL WHAT KIND OF CONSEQUENCES IT WILL HAVE IT MIGHT BE A GOOD SAFETY MEASURE BUT REALLY WHO KNOWS BUT I DO ENCOURAGE YOU INTO LOOKING INTO STUDYING WORKING ABROAD
DOUBT IT WILL MAKE THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE FOR PHYSICS RESEARCHERS TO BE HONEST IN TERMS OF FUNDING ONLY ABOUT OF PUBLICLY FUNDED PHYSICS RESEARCH IN THE UK COMES FROM THE EU ACCORDING TO THE IOP

WITH THAT SAID YOU'RE TOO EARLY TO DECIDE WHETHER YOU WANT TO DO A PHD ANYWAY AT THE VERY LEAST YOU NEED TO WAIT TWO YEARS AND SEE IF YOU ACTUALLY LIKE IT AS YOU'VE ONLY COMPLETED ONE YEAR I HAD TONS OF FRIENDS WHO THOUGHT AT THE END OF THEIR FIRST YEAR THAT THEY WANTED TO DO PHS AND HARDLY ANY OF THEM ACTUALLY ENDED UP STARTING THEM ONCE YOU'VE FINISHED THIRD YEAR IS WHEN YOU NEED TO START THINKING ABOUT IT AND BY THAT TIME WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE MUCH MORE CLARITY ON HOW BREVIT WILL AFFECT COLLABORATIONS FUNDING ETC
IF YOU WANT TO DO A PHD IN THE EU THEN DO IT CONCERNS OVER BREVIT OR POLITICS REALLY SHOULDN'T ENTER INTO IT
USE A RESISTIVE SENSOR INSTEAD THEY ARE VERY CHEAP AND QUITE ACCURATE
THAT IS A LOT OF DETAIL TO TRY TO SORT OUT FOR YOU I CAN SAY TO THE DIGITS ON THE DISPLAY USUALLY ONLY RELATE TO A DEVICES BEST CASE NOISE FLOOR SO IF YOU HAVE A MEASUREMENT BOX THAT PRODUCES DIGITS IT'S POSSIBLE THAT ONLY ONE SETTING WITH A HEAVY FILTER AND LOTS OF SAMPLES MIGHT GET YOU CLOSE TO DIGITS I'VE SEEN MORE AND MORE CHEAPER TEST AND MEASUREMENT DEVICES THESE DAYS THAT PRODUCE MORE DIGITS THAN THE LIMITS OF THEIR NOISE FLOOR TOO

WHILE I CAN'T GO THROUGH ALL THE DETAILS YOU'RE SPECIFICALLY ASKING PERHAPS THESE REFERENCES MIGHT HELP YOU SOME

SITES DEFAULT FILES DOCUMENTS CALIBRATIONS

SITES DEFAULT FILES DOCUMENTS CALIBRATIONS

YOUR REPEATABILITY IS PROBABLY BEING LIMITED BY THE ACCURACY OF THE COLD JUNCTION SENSOR INSIDE THE BOX IF SO STABILIZING THE BOX TEMPERATURE WOULD PROBABLY IMPROVE YOUR RESULTS
AS A PRACTICING PHYSICIST IN THE REAL WORLD I WOULD SAY THAT PYTHON IS A GODSEND LEARN THAT AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SOLVE JUST ABOUT ANYTHING YOU COME ACROSS AFTER SPENDING YEARS USING FORTRAN C AND ROOT ON A HEP EXPERIMENT I WISH I COULD GO BACK AND DO IT OVER WITH PYTHON
DO PHYSICISTS ACTUALLY DO THIS DO THEY BUILD THE CODE THEMSELVES OR DOES THIS CODE EXISTS ALREADY FOR ANYONE TO USE

YES ALL THE TIME FOR SOMETHING SIMPLE YOU CAN JUST WRITE YOUR OWN FOR A MAJOR PROJECT YOU'LL PROBABLY USE A SOFTWARE PACKAGE SOMEONE ELSE DEVELOPED UNLESS OF COURSE YOU'RE THE KIND OF PHYSICIST WHO LIKES TO WRITE THESE KINDS OF MAJOR PACKAGES

2 WHAT ARE THE COMMON JUST BUILD A PROGRAM TO SOLVE IT PROBLEMS EQUATIONS FORMULAE ETC THAT ARE SOLVED THIS WAY

BASICALLY EVERYTHING AT LEAST IN MY EXPERIENCE WORKING IN EXPERIMENTAL NUCLEAR PHYSICS AS YOU GET FURTHER AND FURTHER INTO UNDERGRAD YOU START TO REALIZE HOW FEW PHYSICAL PROBLEMS ARE REALLY SOLVABLE ANALYTICALLY FOR EVERYTHING ELSE YOU RELY ON COMPUTATION

A RECENT EXAMPLE FOR ME WAS THAT I NEEDED TO KNOW WHAT FRACTION OF GAMMA RAYS ARE EMITTED WITHIN SOME SOLID ANGLE FROM A MOVING SOURCE AS A FUNCTION OF ITS SPEED

I TRIED TO WORK OUT THE PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTION ANALYTICALLY IN SOME SCRIBBLES ON A NOTEPAD AFTER ABOUT FIVE MINUTES I JUST DECIDED TO WRITE A QUICK MONTE CARLO CODE INSTEAD
IT IS NOT UNCOMMON IN PHYSICS AND ENGINEERING TO NEED TO DO SPECIALIZED CALCULATIONS OVER AND OVER AGAIN MANY HAVE DEVELOPED COMPUTATIONAL FEATURES FOR THEIR SPECIFIC FIELD

HERE ARE A FEW QUICK EXAMPLES

ASTRONOMY

MACHINE LEARNING FOR ASTRONOMY

SIGNAL PROCESSING

FERMI EVEN HAS THEIR ONLY LINUX BISTRO

HOWEVER YOU MIGHT WANT TO START BY LEARNING HOW TO DO NUMERICAL SOLUTIONS TO ODE'S OR OTHER TYPES OF COMMON MATH PROBLEMS BEFORE YOU START TRYING TO APPLY THEM TO SPECIFIC AREAS

HERE IS A BOOK ON COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS IN PYTHON PYTHON HAS A LOT OF DIFFERENT TOOLS FOR SCIENTISTS ALL OF THE EXERCISES FOR THE BOOK ARE MADE AVAILABLE BY THE AUTHOR MY UPPER DIVISION PHYSICS COURSE IN COMPUTATIONAL METHODS IN PHYSICS IS USING THIS BOOK THIS IS ALSO A GREAT RESOURCE FOR LEARNING HOW TO SOLVE INTEGRALS AND DERIVATIVES WITHOUT ANALYTIC SOLUTIONS NUMERICALLY
I WAS WHAT YOU WOULD CALL A COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICIST I DEVELOPED ALGORITHMS RAN MASSIVE SIMULATIONS ANALYZED COMPLEX DATASETS TO STUDY HOW SELF ASSEMBLE INTO CRYSTAL STRUCTURES PRETTY MUCH YOU WILL EITHER WORK IN A LAB OR WRITE CODE AS A PHYSICIST IT'S UP TO YOU
YES WE DO
SOME OF US LIKE ME EVEN SPECIALIZE IN IT I'M CURRENTLY ON MY LAST MASTER'S YEAR AND I'M WORKING ON FRITTING SIMULATION CODE AS SAID ON THE THREAD PYTHON IS VERY FAMOUS ON THIS FIELD ALTHOUGH I JUST USE IT FOR PROTOTYPING NOWADAYS
I'M LIKE YOU AND CAME INTO PHYSICS WITH A STRONG BACKGROUND IN HANDS ON PROGRAMMING I USE IT EVERY DAY IT'S LIKE HAVING A GREAT TOOL IN YOUR TOOLBOX THAT NOT EVERYONE ELSE HAS BEING REALLY GOOD AT MATH ALSO HELPS

THERE ARE MATH COURSES ON NUMERICAL ANALYSIS THAT HELP TREMENDOUSLY WITH COMPUTATION FOR PHYSICS AND NOT ALL PHYSICISTS GET THAT TRAINING SO CONSIDER IT IT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DOING SOMETHING AND KNOWING WHAT YOU'RE ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN WRITE ABOUT IT

DON'T FORGET THAT COMPUTATION IS NOT ONLY USED FOR MODELING WE DO THAT A LOT IT'S ALSO USED FOR DATA ANALYSIS EXPERIMENTAL DATA DOESN'T ANALYZE ITSELF YOU OFTEN HAVE TO TREAT IT IN SPECIAL WAYS TO EXTRACT THE MOST AND THE CORRECT INFORMATION FROM IT IMAGE PROCESSING IS A MAJOR FIELD IN MICROSCOPY AND MANY MANY FIELDS PEOPLE ARE JUST STARTING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HANDLE TERABYTES OF DATA NOW COMING FROM THEIR EXPERIMENTS PER DAY

YOU'D BE AMAZED HOW MANY ENGINEERS IN THEIR AND DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE ANYTHING BUT EXCEL IT'S ALMOST TRAGIC THAT THAT LEVEL OF PROGRAMMING INNUMERABLY IS ACCEPTABLE IT'S COMMONPLACE AND IT GIVES YOU A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IF YOU'RE FLUENT IN PROGRAMMING
I HAVE A BACHELOR'S IN PHYSICS AND I'VE DONE SEVERAL SIMULATIONS PROFESSIONALLY

AS OTHERS MENTIONED NUMERICAL RECIPES IS A GREAT BOOK LITERALLY GENERATIONS OF PHYSICISTS HAVE REGARDED IT AS THE BIBLE

THERE ARE SEVERAL PHYSICS TOOL KITS AVAILABLE BEANT IS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE IT SIMULATES QUANTUM FIELD PHYSICS IN FIELDS AND MATERIALS I'VE USED IT TO SIMULATE ACTIVE RADIATION SHIELDS THE ALPHA MAGNETIC SPECTROMETER AND VARIOUS RADIATION DETECTORS

RECENTLY I WROTE A SIMULATION OF THE INNER SOLAR SYSTEM USING A LEAP FROG VARIANT OF THE ALGORITHM LATER I PROCESSED THE ORBITS IN ORDER TO LEANT HOW TO DO FAST FOURIER TRANSFORMS ALL THIS WITHOUT A KIT INCLUDING MAKING MY OWN VECTOR OBJECTS I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PROJECT

TO GET MY RIGHT I FIRST CODED A PENDULUM USING THE ACTUAL NONLINEAR EQUATION OF MOTION FOR A PENDULUM AS OPPOSED TO THE USUAL SMALL ANGLE APPROXIMATION

THERE ARE AS MANY PROJECTS AS THERE ARE EQUATIONS IF MOTION
I CAN CONFIRM THAT OF MY RESEARCH IS DONE IN MATHEMATIC AND ONCE I STARTED DOING THAT ALMOST ALL OF MY INVOLVED PHYSICS PROBLEMS IN ASSIGNMENTS FOR MY UPPER YEAR UNDERGRAD COURSES WERE DONE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY IN MATHEMATIC

IF IT WAS VERY MATRIX HEAVY AND DIDN'T REQUIRE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS SOMETIMES I USED MATALAN
PROBABLY MORE SUITED FOR R ASKPHYSICS

FOR SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS FOURIER TRANSFORM THERE ARE NUMEROUS LIBRARIES OUT THERE THAT IMPLEMENT THESE METHODS EVEN FOR MORE COMPLICATED STUFF THERE ARE COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE PACKAGES THAT DO A WIDE VARIETY OF SIMULATIONS SUCH AS FLUIDS MOLECULAR DYNAMICS ELECTROMAGNETICS AND HEAT TRANSFER BUT THESE COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE PACKAGES ARE OFTEN GEARED TOWARDS INDUSTRY USERS WHO HAVE SOMEWHAT PREDICTABLE AND STANDARD NEEDS IN THEIR SIMULATIONS WHEN YOU START NEEDING CUSTOM FEATURES SIMULATIONS OR LARGER CONTROL OVER YOUR CODE THEN YOU ARE FORCED TO CODE YOUR OWN THING FOR EXAMPLE SOLVING THE HEAT EQUATION IS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF FREE CODE ONLINE BUT IF YOU WANT TO START INCORPORATING HYSTERETIC PHASE CHANGES OR OTHER NONLINEAR EFFECTS THEN IT'LL BE MUCH HARDER TO GET THIS OUT OF AN AVAILABLE PIECE OF CODE SO YOU'LL NEED TO BUILD YOUR OWN
IN CERTAIN PARTS OF EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF MAN HOURS GO INTO DEVELOPING DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEMS TO CONTROL EXPERIMENTS AND TAKE DATA FROM THEM

BEYOND THAT ALMOST ALL NONTRIVIAL DATA ANALYSIS INVOLVES PROGRAMMING IN SOME FORM OUR EXPERIMENT HAS REPOSITORIES FULL OF CODES WHICH ANALYSIS ALL KINDS OF DATA DO ALL KINDS OF COMPLICATED CURVE FITTING AND MAKE ALL OF OUR PRETTY PLOTS

TO DESIGN EXPERIMENTS AND EVALUATE SYSTEMATICS WE HAVE OUR OWN MONTE CARLO PACKAGES

PROBABLY THE SINGLE MOST COMMON THING THING WE HAVE TO DO IS FIT VARIOUS CURVES THIS MIGHT SEEM TRIVIAL BUT WHEN YOU GET TO FITTING NONLINEAR THINGS TO NOISY DATA IN A ROBUST WAY OR YOU WANT TO GET THE BEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OUT THERE IS QUITE A LOT OF OPTIMIZATION THAT CAN GO ON EVEN IF THE ACTUAL LEAST SQUARES FIT IS DONE BY A BUILT IN PACKAGE

IF YOU WANT TO PRACTICE I'D JUST SAY TO LEARN BUMPY AND SNIPY IN WHATEVER LABS YOU TAKE GO OVERBOARD ON THE DATA ANALYSIS
IT'S A WHOLE FIELD OF IT'S OWN THESE DAYS SOME WOULD EVEN ARGUE THAT THERE ARE NOW BRANCHES OF SCIENCE THEORETICAL EXPERIMENTAL COMPUTATIONAL RUNNING SIMULATIONS OR


IF YOU LIKE PROGRAMMING OR EVEN BETTER APPLIED COMPUTER SCIENCE HAVE A LOOK AT SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE PHYSICS I HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN PHYSICS AND AM ABOUT TO FINISH MY MASTER'S IN COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE WHERE IN MY BACHELOR'S I TOOK A FEW CS COURSES FOR FUN MY SCHEDULE NOW IS A OF GRADUATE CS COURSES AND PHYSICS

I'M FOCUSING ON COMPUTING MOSTLY TAKING COURSES ON CS SUBJECTS LIKE DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE AND PARALLEL PROGRAMMING AS WELL AS COURSES ON NUMERICAL METHODS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS OTHERS ARE FOCUSING ON MORE APPLIED PHYSICS AND I KNOW OF OTHER PROGRAMS WHICH ARE BASICALLY THE MATHEMATICS OF NUMERICAL METHODS

PERSONALLY I REALLY LIKE WHAT I HAVE LEARNED SO FAR AND I THINK IT WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE FOR ME BUT THERE IS RELATIVELY LITTLE MENTION OF IT IN MOST BACHELOR PROGRAMS I THINK JUST MENTIONING IT IN CASE THIS TURNS OUT TO BE SOMETHING YOU MIGHT WISH TO PURSUE
I STRONGLY RECOMMEND STARTING WITH PYTHON AND FOR YOUR PURPOSES WORKING THROUGH SOME PROBLEMS AT


YES I WRITE ALL OF MY OWN CODE AND ACTUALLY USE FOURIER TRANSFORMS A LOT

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND SEEKING OUT A RESEARCH ASSISTANTSHIP WITH A PROFESSOR AT YOUR UNIVERSITY AND THEN APPLYING FOR SUMMER PROGRAMS ELSEWHERE WHEN I WAS AN UNDERGRAD MANY YEARS AGO I DID FOUR DIFFERENT RESEARCH PROJECTS IN THREE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND I WAS PAID FOR ALL OF THEM IT'S AMAZING WHAT'S AVAILABLE IF YOU'RE MOTIVATED AND SEEK IT OUT AT THE TIME I WAS DOING ASTROPHYSICS NOW I DO EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS AND DURING THOSE RESEARCH PROGRAMS I GOT TO GO OBSERVING AT TWO OF THE BIGGEST TELESCOPES IN THE WORLD AS WELL AS OTHERS THEY WERE SOME OF THE BEST YEARS OF MY LIFE AND I LEARNED SO MUCH ESPECIALLY PROGRAMMING
I WOULD RECOMMEND GETTING ANALYTICAL MECHANICS THE THING WITH SOLVING PHYSICS PROBLEMS WITH A COMPUTER IS THAT YOU STILL NEED TO SET THE PROBLEM UP YOURSELF THIS BOOK IS ALL ABOUT THE SETTING UP OF PROBLEMS AND IT ALSO GOES OVER WAYS TO SOLVE THEM USING MATHEMATIC AT THE END OF EACH CHAPTER
HOPE THIS IS AT LEAST TANGENTIALLY RELEVANT BUT I SUGGEST YOU TRY YOUR HAND AT USING MATHEMATIC THERE IS A SMALL LEARNING CURVE BUT AFTER USING IT FOR A WHILE I FIND THAT I LOVE IT DEFINITELY A GREAT COMPUTATIONAL PROGRAM FOR SOLVING AND MODELING PHYSICS PROBLEMS IT'S A SUPER FUN LEARNING TOOL IN MY OPINION
YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN READING ABOUT THE PHYSICS MODELING AND NUMERICAL CALCULATION THAT WENT INTO THE SNOW SIMULATION IN THE MOVIE FROZEN
WE HAD A GENERIC COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS COURSE IN UNDERGRAD DONE IN C WITH EXAMPLES LIKE NUMERICAL INTEGRATION DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION SOLVING ETC IT WAS A GOOD BROAD INTRO TO THIS STUFF

PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING I'VE BEEN DOING SINCE I GOT INTO PARTICLE PHYSICS IS WRITING CODE TO DO COLLISION EVENT RECONSTRUCTION A LOT OF THE TIME THE BASIC CODE EXISTS BUT REQUIRES MODIFICATION SOMETIMES IT NEEDS A LOT MORE WORK

IN MY TIME I'VE DONE A LOT OF OUTREACH WORK WITH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND MOST OF THE TIME THEY ARE SURPRISED THAT EVERYONE SPENDS A FAIR BIT OF TIME CODING
JUST SO YOU'RE AWARE OP YOUR SKILLET WOULD DO VERY WELL IN VIDEO GAMES IF YOU EVER DECIDED TO PURSUE A DIFFERENT CAREER PATHOLOGY
I RECOMMEND YOU GET A BOOK ABOUT COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS THAT WILL TEACH YOU SEVERAL USEFUL ALGORITHMS AND WILL HAVE EXAMPLES TO APPLY THEM FAST FOURIER TRANSFORM IS ONE OF THEM IT'S FOURIER TRANSFORM BUT IMPLEMENTED IN A WAY THAT MAKES IT FEASIBLE TO DO BECAUSE IT'S FAST ENOUGH
MANY MATERIALS SIMULATIONS PROGRAMS ARE ATOMISTIC IN CHARACTER THAT IS THEY SIMULATE THE BEHAVIOURS OF ATOMS IN THE SYSTEM OF INTEREST THIS CAN BE DONE USING EITHER CLASSICAL MECHANICS OR QUANTUM MECHANICS

IT IS QUITE FEASIBLE TO WRITE YOUR OWN PROGRAMS BASED ON CLASSICAL MECHANICS FOR EXAMPLE MOLECULAR DYNAMICS OR MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS THE QUANTUM MECHANICAL PROGRAMS ARE USUALLY GROUP EFFORTS

WHETHER YOU WRITE YOUR OWN CODE OR USE SOMEONE THE REAL SKILL IS TO EXTRACT THE QUANTITY OF INTEREST FROM THE PROGRAM OUTPUT FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE A DUMP OF ATOMIC POSITIONS AND VELOCITIES AT VARIOUS TIMES YOU MIGHT WISH TO EXTRACT A MACROSCOPIC QUANTITY SUCH AS AN ELASTIC CONSTANT OR THE VISCOSITY THIS REQUIRES BOTH PHYSICS KNOWLEDGE AND AN ABILITY TO PROGRAM
SOMEDAY I'D LIKE TO SEE A COMPUTATIONAL GENETIC ALGORITHM THAT ATTEMPTS TO SOLVE PHYSICS I MEAN LIKE A COMPUTER PROGRAM THAT MAKES UP EQUATIONS OUT OF THE VARIOUS PHYSICAL CONSTANTS AND KNOWN OPERATORS AND SUCH AND USES THE RULES OF NATURAL SELECTION TO DETERMINE WHICH ONES ARE CLOSER TO FITTING REALITY AND THEN MATING THOSE TOGETHER IN SOME WAY THAT PRODUCES VIABLE OFFSPRING I DUNNO SOMEONE SMARTER THAN ME WILL HAVE TO WORK OUT THE DETAILS BUT HEY MAYBE THAT'S HOW WE'LL SOLVE STRING THEORY
MUCH HAS BEEN WRITTEN ALREADY

FOR YOUR 2 THOUGH I WOULD SUGGEST LOOKING INTO SIMPLE DEMONSTRATION PROBLEMS OF COURSE YOU'VE SEEN PEOPLE DO THEM ALREADY BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE NOT USEFUL TO DO

HERE'S A FUN ONE ORBITAL MECHANICS TRY TO DO A NUMERICAL SOLUTION FOR A SIMPLE ORBIT THERE'S A REASONABLE CHANCE YOU'LL FIND YOUR ORBIT DIVERGES WHICH MEANS YOU GET TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO FIX IT
SHORT ANSWER YES

IF FOR EXAMPLE YOU'RE LOOKING AT A GALAXY THAT IS MILLION LIGHTYEARS AWAY THAT MEANS IT HAS TAKEN LIGHT EMITTED BY THE GALAXY MILLION YEARS TO REACH YOUR PUPIL OBVIOUSLY THE GALAXY HAS CONTINUED TO AGE IN THAT MILLION YEARS THAT THE LIGHT WAS TRAVELING BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT LIGHT YET ITS STILL TRAVELING ANOTHER WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT A GALAXY MILLION LIGHT YEARS AWAY IS DOING RIGHT NOW YOU'D HAVE TO CHECK BACK IN MILLION YEARS ONCE THE LIGHT HAS ARRIVED

I'M SURE THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO CAN GIVE BETTER EXAMPLES EXPLAIN MORE ELOQUENTLY BUT THERE YA GO HOPE IT HELPS

EDIT TYPO
THERE'S MORE TO IT

THE MORE DISTANT A GALAXY THE FASTER IT IS MOVING RELATIVE TO US AS A CONSEQUENCE OF RELATIVITY WE KNOW THAT THE FASTER SOMETHING MOVES RELATIVE TO US THE LESS IT AGES RELATIVE TO US AS THESE MORE DISTANT GALAXIES APPROACH THE SPEED OF LIGHT OR THE SPEED OF CAUSALITY THEY BARELY AGE RELATIVE TO US SO THE IMAGES WE SEE OF REMOTE GALAXIES ARE OF YOUNG GALAXIES

EVEN MORE MIND BOGGLING THIS ALSO MEANS THAT THE MATTER THAT WE'RE COMPOSED OF IS ACTUALLY OLDER THAN THE MATTER THAT MAKES UP THE DISTANT GALAXIES FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE AND FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A REMOTE GALAXY ALL OF THIS IS OPPOSITE WE'RE THE REMOTE GALAXY THAT BARELY AGES ETC

RECOMMENDED READ RELATIVITY VISUALIZED BY LEWIS CARROLL EPSTEIN

RECOMMENDED WATCH THE PBS SPACE TIME CHANNEL ON YOUTUBE FOR EXAMPLE THIS VIDEO
SINCE THERE'S NO GLOBAL TIME IT MAKES NO SENSE TO SAY WHAT IS THAT STAR LOOKING LIKE RIGHT NOW WE ONLY SEE THE LIGHT IT SENT OUT YEARS AGO BOTH OF THESE STATEMENTS PRETEND THERE'S UNIVERSAL TIME FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES RIGHT NOW I EAST OUR PRESENT IS WHAT WE CAN SEE NOW LIGHT REACHING US NOW IS WHAT STUFF LOOKS LIKE NOW

YET REGARDING YOUR QUESTION WHAT PEOPLE MEAN BY THAT IS THAT THE LIGHT TRAVELLED A NON ZERO DISTANCE TO REACH US
THIS IS NOT UNIQUE TO STARS OR ANYTHING ELSE SINCE LIGHT TAKES SOME AMOUNT OF TIME TO REACH YOU YOU ARE ALWAYS LOOKING AT THE PAST FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR YOU ARE SEEING YOURSELF SOME VERY SMALL FRACTION OF A SECOND IN THE PAST
YUP IN FACT THE STATE OF A SUBSTANCE BASED ON THE TEMPERATURE WHICH IS HOW WE USUALLY THINK OF THINGS CHANGING STATE AND PRESSURE IS USUALLY GRAPHED IN SOMETHING CALLED A PHASE DIAGRAM TAKE A LOOK
THAT DEPENDS ON THE LIQUID WATER IS DENSER AS A LIQUID THAN A SOLID SO YOU GET THE OPPOSITE YOU CAN TAKE ICE AND COMPRESS IT TO A LIQUID AS IN THIS CHART

BUT IF YOU HAVE ETHANOL THAN THE SOLID IS DENSER THAN THE LIQUID SO ADDING PRESSURE WILL CAUSE THE LIQUID TO FORM A SOLID SHOWN HERE
PHYSICAL PHASEEQIA
ALSO NOTICE THAT THE EFFECT OF PRESSURE IS MUCH GREATER ON THE GAS LIQUID TRANSITION THAN IT IS FOR THE LIQUID SOLID TRANSITION

EDIT POSTED THE SAME GRAPH TWICE
DEPENDS ON THE MATERIAL FOR MOST IT DOES HAPPEN THAT WAY WHILE FOR WATER PRESSURE CAN TURN ICE INTO LIQUID WATER

WIKI FILE

HERE IS A PHASE DIAGRAM IT SHOWS WHAT PHASE A MATERIAL IS DEPENDING ON TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE

THE SOLID GREEN LINE APPLIES TO NORMAL MATERIALS

IF YOU ARE AT A TEMPERATURE SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OF TTP OR SIMPLY TO THE RIGHT OF THE TRIPLE POINT WHEN THE PRESSURE IS LOW YOU ARE IN THE VAPOUR PHASE AS YOU GO HIGHER YOU GO TO LIQUID AND THEN TO SOLID


THE DOTTED GREEN LINE HOWEVER GIVES THE ANOMALOUS BEHAVIOUR OF WATER YOU CAN BE IN THE SOLID PHASE SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT OF THE TRIPLE POINT HERE INCREASING THE PRESSURE ENOUGH PUTS YOU INTO THE LIQUID PHASE THIS IS WHAT CAUSES SLIPPING ON ICE STANDING ON IT INCREASES THE PRESSURE IT MELTS A LITTLE BIT OF IT WHICH YOU THEN SLIP ON
WIKI
SOMETIMES SOME GASES EAST G OXYGEN CANNOT EVEN BE LIQUIFIED WITHOUT COOLING
WHAT HAPPENS AT THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH IS THE IRON CORE SOLID OR LIQUID
YES METALLIC HYDROGEN
THE SOURCE IS VERY SMALL WHICH CAN POTENTIALLY ALLOW VERY FOCUSED BEAMS IF THE MOMENTUM SPREAD IS NOT TOO LARGE I COULD IMAGINE THAT THE BIG COLLIDES ARE INTERESTED IN THAT TECHNOLOGY AS WELL TO FOCUS THE BEAMS EVEN BETTER

AT PRESENT PROTON BEAMS ARE PRODUCED IN CONVENTIONAL ACCELERATORS IN CONTRAST PROTON BEAMS OPEN THE DOOR TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL PERHAPS EVEN CHEAPER AND MORE EFFICIENT METHODS OF TREATMENT

IT IS WORTH MENTIONING THAT THERE ARE MORE THAN PARTICLE ACCELERATORS AROUND WHILE THEY USED THE MOST POWERFUL LASER HERE AND FOCUSSING SUCH A LASER BEAM ON A TARGET IN THE HUMAN BODY WILL BE VERY CHALLENGING
DELETED
DO YOU HAVE ANY CONTEXT YOU WANT TO ADD TO THIS PAPER AND HOW IT RELATES TO THE CURRENT STATE OF THE FIELD OR TELL US WHY YOU FIND IT INTERESTING BEYOND THE NAME
WHY AM I GETTING DOWNVOTED SHOULD I HAVE POSTED THIS IN A DIFFERENT THREAD
QUANTUM IS CERTAINLY AN OPTION YOU'LL PROBABLY WANT TO LEARN SOME LINEAR ALGEBRA FIRST THOUGH SOME BOOKS EAST G SHANKAR HAVE A SUFFICIENT INTRODUCTION ON THEIR OWN

I WOULD SHY AWAY FROM STATISTICAL MECHANICS UNTIL AFTER QUANTUM

ALTERNATIVELY ELECTROMAGNETISM OR SPECIAL RELATIVITY ARE OPTIONS
AT MY COLLEGE THE PREDREW FOR QM IS A COURSE ON OSCILLATIONS WAVES IT'S SUGGESTED THAT STUDENTS ARE IN A STATISTICAL PHYSICS COURSE WHILE THEY TAKE QM A SOLID KNOWLEDGE OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS WON'T HURT EITHER
I DO NOT HAVE A COPY OF TEXT ON HAND DO THE ESSENTIAL CHAPTERS INCLUDE HAMILTONIAN MECHANICS HOW DID YOU FARE WITH THE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS IN THE COURSE

IF YOU ARE FINE WITH THOSE TOPICS THEN QUANTUM MECHANICS IS ACTUALLY A REASONABLE NEXT COURSE OF STUDY FOR YOU I SUGGEST GRIFFITHS TEXTBOOK IF YOU CAN GET YOUR HANDS ON IT CHEAPLY
DID YOU STUDY ANALYTICAL MECHANICS IE HAMILTONIAN LAGRANGIAN MECHANICS

IF YOU DIDN'T DO THAT BEFORE GOING TO QUANTUM MECHANICS

OTHERWISE CLASSICAL ELECTRODYNAMIC SPECIAL RELATIVITY MAY BE TOPICS
COPY PASTING WITH MINOR CHANGES FROM MY RESPONSE ON A RECENT R ASKSCIENCE THREAD

YOU NEED TO DO SOME WORK ON YOUR SYSTEM TO EXTRACT HEAT FROM IT IF YOU DO AN AMOUNT OF WORK W TO EXTRACT AN AMOUNT OF HEAT Q FROM YOUR SYSTEM INITIALLY AT TEMPERATURE T THEN YOU WILL NEED TO DUMP AN AMOUNT OF HEAT

Q W Q

INTO THE SURROUNDINGS WHICH ARE AT SOME HOTTER TEMPERATURE T

IN THERMODYNAMICS THE ENTROPY CHANGE ASSOCIATED WITH ADDING OR REMOVING AN AMOUNT OF HEAT Q FROM A SYSTEM AT TEMPERATURE T IS

S Q T

THE SECOND LAW OF THERMO SAYS THAT THE TOTAL ENTROPY MUST STAY THE SAME OR INCREASE ALWAYS THEN YOUR PROCESS OF COOLING DOWN YOUR SYSTEM WILL NEED TO SATISFY

Q T Q T

THE INEQUALITY IS SATURATED WHEN YOU'RE COOLING THE SYSTEM DOWN WITH A HEAT PUMP RUNNING A REVERSED CARNOT CYCLE REWRITING THIS IN TERMS OF W

W Q T T

SO AS THE TEMPERATURE T GETS CLOSER TO ABSOLUTE ZERO THE AMOUNT OF WORK YOU NEED TO DO TO EXTRACT HEAT GETS LARGER ASYMPTOTICALLY REACHING INFINITY AT ABSOLUTE ZERO
ALSO IF YOU COULD WOULD THAT MAKE WHATEVER IS AT ABSOLUTE ZERO INVISIBLE
AS A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT A SYSTEM AT ABSOLUTE ZERO CANNOT HAVE ANY FORCE APPLIED TO IT EVEN AN INFINITESIMALLY SMALL AMOUNT IMAGINE JUST HOW FAR ANY MASSIVE OBJECT WOULD NEED TO BE FROM THE SYSTEM TO ACHIEVE THIS
FIRST OF ALL TEMPERATURE AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW CONSIDERING YOU MENTIONED DEGENERATE GROUND STATES IS AN EXPRESSION OF KINETIC ENERGY ESSENTIALLY DUE TO QUANTUM JITTERS NOTHING WILL EVER BE COMPLETELY STATIONARY AT THE QUANTUM LEVEL AND IF IT WAS YOU WOULDN'T EVEN BE ABLE TO BE CERTAIN ABOUT IT THERE'S PROBABLY A NUMBER OF REASONS BUT VERY BASICALLY AT THE ATOMIC LEVEL I DON'T THINK IT COULD BE DONE EVEN IN THEORY
THE INTUITIVE EXPLANATION THAT I'VE ALWAYS HEARD RELIES ON THE HEISENBERG UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE SINCE TEMPERATURE DEPENDS ON THE MOTION OF AN OBJECT'S CONSTITUENT MOLECULES AN OBJECT AT ABSOLUTE ZERO WOULD HAVE NO MOTION AND NO KINETIC ENERGY THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE ACCORDING TO HEISENBERG BECAUSE A MOLECULE THAT DOESN'T MOVE AT ALL HAS NO UNCERTAINTY IN POSITION SO THERE ALWAYS MUST BE SOME KIND OF MOTION IN ORDER TO ADHERE TO THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE NO MATTER HOW COLD THE OBJECT IS I COULD BE COMPLETELY WRONG ON THIS SO DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT
SO THE SIMPLEST ANSWER IS TO REALIZE TEMPERATURE REPRESENTS INTERNAL ENERGY OF PARTICLES RANDOMLY FLYING AROUND INTERACTING AND AT K THE THERMAL MOTION OF THE PARTICLES WOULD STOP ALTOGETHER BUT THIS IS A CLASSICAL CONCLUSION WHEREAS QUANTUM MECHANICS IMPLIES HEISENBERG UNCERTAINTY YOU CANNOT KNOW EXACTLY ITS MOMENTUM AND POSITION SO THE PARTICLES WOULD SEEM TO BE VIBRATING A SMALL AMOUNT QUANTUM UNCERTAINTY UPON MEASUREMENT AND ALSO HAVE SPIN AND ALSO THAT ANY SYSTEM WE MAKE IS NOT TRULY CLOSED IF YOU LOOK CLOSE ENOUGH ANY CHANGE YOU MAKE IN YOUR SYSTEM NATURE WILL WORK TO DO THE OPPOSITE ANYWAYS TO BALANCE THINGS OUT
THE SAME REASON YOU CAN'T TAKE SOMETHING WITH MASS UP TO THE SPEED OF LIGHT
I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S THEORETICALLY POSSIBLE IT'S JUST REALLY REALLY HARD
THE EASIEST AND SHORTEST EXPLANATION IS TO SAY IT WOULD BE LIKE TRYING TO GET IT INFINITELY HOT IN REVERSE
HOW DO I DOWNLOAD IT
DO WHAT YOU WANT TO PEOPLE TEND TO MAJOR IN PHYSICS BECAUSE THEY ENJOY IT AND LIKE TO LEARN ABOUT AND UNDERSTAND THE WORLD DON'T MAJOR IN SOMETHING BECAUSE SOMEONE TOLD YOU TO OR BECAUSE THEY CAME UP WITH AN ARGUMENT FOR WHY IT'S BETTER THAN THE ALTERNATIVES YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU WANT FOR YOURSELF OUT OF LIFE FIRST YOU MAY NOT HAVE THAT FIGURED OUT YET AND THAT'S OK TOO IN THE MEANTIME LEARN GROW TRY NEW THINGS AND PURSUE WHAT YOU ENJOY IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU MAY ENJOY PHYSICS

ALSO YOU ARE BEING RATHER PREMATURE AND PRESUMPTUOUS MAKING COMMENTS LIKE MY GRADES CAN PROBABLY GET ME INTO MED SCHOOL YOU'RE ONLY IN HIGH SCHOOL NOW AFTER YOU GET INTO COLLEGE NOBODY WILL CARE WHAT YOUR HIGH SCHOOL GRADES ARE CLASSES ARE GOING TO BE A LOT HARDER IN COLLEGE SO JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE EASILY GETTING STRAIGHT AS NOW DOES NOT GUARANTEE YOU'LL GET GOOD GRADES IN COLLEGE

EDIT I AM ASSUMING YOU ARE IN THE US I REALIZE THAT IN SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD STUDENTS CAN APPLY TO AND ENTER MEDICAL SCHOOL DIRECTLY OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL
I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE REASONS YOU ARE ASKING THIS QUESTION IT SEEMS LIKE YOU WANT TO STUDY PHYSICS BUT HAVE TROUBLE DEFENDING IT TO EITHER YOURSELF YOU DON'T DEEM IT WORTHY OR TO YOUR PARENTS WHO DON'T THINK YOU WILL GET A GOOD JOB

AS AN UNDERGRAD I CAN'T GIVE YOU THE FULL PERSPECTIVE BUT I CAN AT LEAST TELL YOU THIS IN MY EXPERIENCE WITH PHYSICS AND MATH PEOPLE FALL INTO ONE OF TWO CATEGORIES

FIRST THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO REALLY ENJOY PHYSICS AND MATH BUT MAYBE AREN'T EXTREMELY TALENTED OR JUST DON'T WANT TO GO INTO A LIFE OF ACADEMIA AFTER UNDERGRAD SOME MAY GET A PHD BUT MOST USE THEIR DEGREE S TO GET A DECENT JOB MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT MOST OF THESE PEOPLE DO WELL IN LIFE AND ARE HAPPY AS THE JOBS YOU CAN SECURE WITH A PHYSICS OR MATH DEGREE ARE FAIRLY LUCRATIVE

THE SECOND CATEGORY AND THE ONE I'M IN ARE THE PEOPLE WHO NOT ONLY ENJOY THE STUFF BUT ALSO WANT TO DEDICATE THEIR LIFE TO IT FOR MOST THE QUESTION OF WHY STUDY PHYSICS IS SORT OF A NON STARTER WE WANT TO DO THINGS THAT ARE INTERESTING AND PHYSICS CAN PROVIDE US WITH THE FINANCIAL MEANS TO SURVIVE SO WHY NOT IF YOU ARE QUESTIONING WHY YOU WANT TO STUDY PHYSICS THIS PROBABLY MEANS THAT YOU ARE NOT A PART OF THIS SECOND CATEGORY OR IT MEANS THAT YOU HAVEN'T STUDIED ENOUGH PHYSICS AND HAVEN'T SEEN HOW AWESOME IT TRULY IS IN WHICH CASE I ENVY YOU IF YOU ARE TRYING TO DEFEND YOURSELF FROM YOUR PARENTS AND YOU ARE STRUGGLING TO COME UP WITH A REASON THEN YOU ARE PROBABLY A PART OF THIS CATEGORY TO THIS I WOULD TELL YOUR PARENTS THAT BECOMING A PHYSICS RESEARCHER WILL NOT MAKE YOU ABSURDLY RICH BUT IF YOU DO A GOOD JOB YOU WILL MAKE A DECENT AMOUNT OF MONEY GET A DECENT CAR SEND YOUR KIDS TO GOOD SCHOOLS ETC BUT YOU WOULD ALSO GET THE ADDED BENEFIT OF A FULFILLING LIFE SOMETHING THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T GET

BUT DON'T STRESS OUT TOO MUCH ABOUT THIS IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE A FRESHMAN IN COLLEGE SO YOUR FIRST YEAR YOU ARE PROBABLY TAKING GENERAL COURSES ABUSE THIS TIME TO LEARN MORE ABOUT PHYSICS GO TO THE LIBRARY AND PICK OUT BOOKS THAT LOOK INTERESTING KNOCK ON PROFESSOR'S DOORS AND ASK THEM QUESTIONS PRESUMABLY GOOD QUESTIONS AND BE POLITE THE WORLD IS YOUR OYSTER
I PROBABLY WOULDN'T STUDY PHYSICS TO GO INTO MEDICINE

IF YOU WANT A MATH AND SCIENCE HEAVY DEGREE WITH A FOCUS ON PHYSICS MAYBE CONSIDER ENGINEERING

YOU COULD STUDY PHYSICS IF ACADEMICS AND RESEARCH ARE APPEALING TO YOU
BS IN PHYSICS HERE
WITH PHYSICS OR MEDICINE YOU WILL NEED AN ADVANCED DEGREE TO DO MUCH OF ANYTHING WITH IN THE REAL WORLD

I FELL BACKWARDS INTO PHYSICS FROM ENGINEERING AND NOW WHILE I STILL HAVE A VERY DEEP LOVE FOR SCIENCE I HAVE A PROGRAMMING JOB

PHYSICS PAIRS NICELY WITH MATHEMATICS AND MAKES FOR A VERY LOGICAL DOUBLE MAJOR IF YOU WANT TO WORK TOWARDS A MASTER'S OR PHD IN ASTROLOGY OR SOMETHING RESEARCH BASED IF YOU WANT TO GO INTO CODING YOU MIGHT WANT TO THROW IN SOME CS COURSES IN THERE TOO

PHYSICS PAIRS WITH CHEMISTRY ONCE YOU GET INTO LOOKING AT THE MOLECULAR MODELS AND ATOMIC BONDS IT'S BASICALLY ADVANCED QUANTUM MECHANICS ALSO MATH HEAVY I HAD A COUPLE OF FRIENDS WHO DOUBLE MAJORED WITH THIS AND THEY ALL WENT ON TO PURSUE ADVANCED DEGREES AND ARE NOW DOING CANCER RESEARCH OR SIMILAR

HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE GOOD LUCK AND DON'T FORGET COENJOY YOUR JOURNEY
MAJOR IN PHYSICS IF IT'S WHAT YOU LOVE SURE YOU MIGHT NOT MAKE A DOCTORS SALARY BUT HOW HAPPY YOU ARE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN HOW MUCH IS IN YOUR BANK ACCOUNT
FIRST YEAR UNDERGRAD IN PHYSICS HERE BASED IN THE UK I ASSUME FROM THE MENTION OF AS LEVELS YOU ARE IN THE UK TOO HERE'S A FEW REASONS WHY I CHOSE PHYSICS
ALL THROUGH SCHOOL AND INCLUDING SIXTH FORM MATHS WAS MY FAVOURITE SUBJECT I EVEN DID BETTER IN A LEVEL MATHS THAN PHYSICS HOWEVER MY FAVOURITE PARTS OF PHYSICS WERE BETTER THAN ANY MATHS LESSON WHEN I SAW A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE EQUATIONS I WAS USING AND THE WORLD AROUND ME I KNEW THAT A PHYSICS DEGREE WOULD BE HEAVILY MATHS BASED SO I WENT FOR IT I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO REGRETS

MED SCHOOL IS FINE ONE OR TWO OF MY FRIENDS WENT PLAN ON GOING AND IF YOU ENJOY IT THEN IT'S A FANTASTIC DEGREE TO GET BUT THAT'S THE KEY IF YOU ENJOY IT PHYSICS IS VERY EMPLOYABLE MORE SO IN THE UK THAN THE US WITH PEOPLE GOING INTO FINANCE ENGINEERING RESEARCH TEACHING OUTREACH BUSINESS AMONG OTHERS I DID A WEEKS WORK EXPERIENCE WITH AN AEROSPACE COMPANY AND THE PEOPLE I MET WERE GRADUATES FROM A WHOLE MANNER OF STEM DEGREES NOT JUST ENGINEERING

WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS IF YOU ENJOY IT THE PHYSICS IS A FANTASTIC DEGREE TO GET IF YOU DON'T ENJOY IT THEN IT WILL BE THREE OR FOUR YEARS OF HARD WORK WHICH YOU HAVE NO MOTIVATION FOR

QUICK WORD ON JOINT DEGREES THEY CAN BE EXCELLENT IN PROVIDING A RANGE OF SKILLS AND WILL ALWAYS OPEN A LOT OF DOORS PARTICULARLY IN SUBJECTS LIKE PHYSICS AND MATHS WITH SKILLS APPLICABLE TO OTHER FIELDS I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND DOING A JOINT DEGREE IN CHEMISTRY DISCLAIMER DID A LEVEL CHEMISTRY HATED EVERY MINUTE OF IT
I'M OF THE WAY THROUGH MY PHD IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS

THE REASON I GOT THERE IS BECAUSE I FOLLOWED MY PASSION BUT NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO IN LIFE YOU WILL BE HIT BY MOMENTS OF REGRET CONFUSION AND DOUBT NO CHOICE WILL EVER SEEM PERFECT I THINK MOST OF US REALIZE THAT BUT WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT PHYSICS IS THAT IT'S A STEPPING STONE FOR MOST OTHER ADVANCED DISCIPLINES YOU CAN HAVE AN MSC IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS AS A BASE AND GO ON TO DO OTHER THINGS MORE EASILY THAN VICE VERSA

DO PHYSICS IF YOU LIKE THE SENSE OF DEEP MEANING AND UNDERSTANDING BUT REMEMBER DON'T BE AFRAID TO CHANGE TOPIC AFTER YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'VE HAD YOUR SHARE OF PHYSICS

BEST OF LUCK

PS NEVER FORGET THOUGH DON'T TAKE LIFE TOO SERIOUSLY THERE ARE NO RIGHT OR WRONG CHOICES AND DON'T THINK OF A CHOICE AS TERRIBLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IN THE END IT IS NOT

I'D LIKE TO ADD THAT AT THE MOMENT I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT I WANT TO DO AFTER I FINISH MY PHD I'VE HAD A ROUGH TIME THE LAST FEW YEARS BOTH BECAUSE OF INFLUENCES FROM OUTSIDE OF PHYSICS BUT ALSO BECAUSE RESEARCH IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS IS NOT VERY COMPATIBLE WITH A NORMAL LIFESTYLE
MAJOR IN PHYSICS IF YOU WANT TO DO SOME KIND OF RESEARCH IN A PHYSICS AREA SOME RANDOM TERMS FOR YOU QUANTUM COMPUTING OPTICS SEMICONDUCTORS SOLID STATE NUCLEAR PHYSICS ITS POSSIBLE TO GO TO MED SCHOOL TO BECOME SOMEONE WHO TREATS CANCER WITH RADIATION OR STUDIES THAT METHOD STUDYING IMAGING METHODS MRI NMR REALLY EMPLOYERS WONT KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO BUT YOU WILL PROBABLY LEARN OR SHOULD LEARN ALONG THE JOURNEY DATA ANALYSIS THROUGH LABS YOU DO HIGH LEVEL MATH THE ABILITY TO PROBLEM SOLVE SOME PROGRAMMING I MAJOR IN PHYSICS PREPARING FOR MECHANICAL AEROSPACE ENGINEERING I WISH I HAD GONE PURE ENGINEERING MY SCHOOL IS NOT A TECH SCHOOL I AM STUCK TAKING A CORE CURRICULUM
DELETED
I'LL JUST THROW IN A LITTLE BIT HERE I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD PERSONALLY GO FOR ONLY YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FIGURE THAT OUT BUT THESE CAREERS YOU ARE CURRENTLY DECIDING BETWEEN ALL TAKE A LOT OF COMMITMENT EVEN IF YOU'RE NATURALLY GREAT AT IT AWESOME BUT THIS SHIT IS HARD WORK NO MATTER WHAT SO FIRSTLY YOU NEED TO BE PASSIONATE ENOUGH IN WHATEVER YOU GO INTO THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FROM WHAT YOU'VE SAID THAT SOUNDS LIKE PHYSICS FOR YOU AND EVEN IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND YOU CAN GET A LOT OF DIFFERENT POSITIONS WITH A PHYSICS DEGREE IF YOU DO DECIDE PHYSICS I THINK YOUR IDEA TO DOUBLE MAJOR WITH MATH IS A GREAT IDEA THAT IS WHAT I AM CURRENTLY DOING ACTUALLY THE REASONING BEING GETTING A PHYSICS DEGREE ALREADY GIVES YOU A MATH MINOR AUTOMATICALLY SO WHY NOT STEP IT UP AND BECAUSE NO MATTER WHERE YOU END UP IN THESE FIELDS IT WILL ALL GO BACK TO MATH ANYWAY MATH IS EVERYTHING

GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR DECISION AND IF YOU REALLY LIKE BOOKS I WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND MICHIO AKU HYPERSPACE IN PARTICULAR AND BRIAN GREENE TO START


BE YOUR OWN PERSON AND DON'T LET YOUR PARENTS TELL YOU WHAT TO MAJOR IN
BECAUSE IS FUN
THERE REALLY IS NO SUCH THING AS FRICTION THERE IS JUST SOME AGGREGATE INTERACTION BETWEEN AN OBJECT AND A MEDIUM THAT WE CALL FRICTION

FOR EXAMPLE COMPARE

A SPACECRAFT ENTERS THE ATMOSPHERE AND HEATS UP SLOWING DOWN WHY DRAG AKA FRICTION WITH THE AIR VS

A SAILBOAT AT A DEADSTOP UNFURLS IT'S SAIL AND ACCELERATES ACROSS THE OCEAN WHY WIND

WHY IS ONE CALLED WIND AND THE OTHER CALLED DRAG WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE FROM THE FRAME OF REFERENCE WHERE THE SHIP IS AT REST BOTH ARE WIND

SO SURE FRICTION COULD EXCEED THE FORCE APPLIED BUT THEN WE WOULDN'T CALL IT FRICTION ANYMORE WE WOULD LABEL IT SOMETHING ELSE

THIS IS PAY OF WHY FRICTION IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND ESPECIALLY STATIC FRICTION WHICH ONLY EXISTS WHEN YOU PUSH ON SOMETHING AND NEVER SEEMS TO EXCEED THE FORCE YOU APPLY
I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION DO YOU MEAN THE FORCE NORMAL TO THE SURFACE OR THE FORCE YOU ARE TRYING TO PUSH THE OBJECT WITH PARALLEL TO THE SURFACE
WHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR THAT TO HAPPEN WE CAN SAY THE FORCE OF FRICTION IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE WEIGHT OF THE OBJECT IN QUESTION AND FRICTION WILL OPPOSE A PUSH FORCE SO AN OBJECT THAT GAINS MASS QUICKLY RELATIVE TO FORCE APPLIED WOULD PUSH BACK HARD TO IMAGINE SUCH A THING BUT FUN TO THINK ABOUT
THIS WOULD BE A VIOLATION OF THIRD LAW BECAUSE THE FRICTIONAL FORCE WOULD BE GREATER THAN THE APPLIED FORCE NOT TO MENTION THAT KINETIC FRICTION ALWAYS GOES AGAINST THE DIRECTION OF MOTION
GREAT VIDEO U MRPENNYWHISTLE I REMEMBER WATCHING IT A FEW DAYS AGO WHEN YOUTUBE POPPED IT UP ON MY SUBSCRIPTION LIST VERY FORTUNATE TO BE FLYING WITH THEM IN

BTW A CLATHROID CURVE TECHNICALLY KNOWN AS AN EULER SPIRAL IS WHAT THEY USE FOR ROLLER COASTERS HIGHWAY ON OFF RAMPS STREET INTERSECTIONS WITHOUT IT CARS WOULD BE SKIDDING TANGENTIALLY OFF HIGHWAY RAMPS

TRANSPORTATION
AND I'M JEALOUS AWESOME VIDEO
CLOTHOIDS ARE INCREDIBLY COOL THEY'RE MY FAVORITE CURVE THAT ONE YOU SHOWED WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATELY CALLED A CLATHROID LOOP MADE OUT OF CLATHROID SPIRAL SEGMENTS

THIS CURVE IS USED BECAUSE ITS CURVATURE CHANGES LINEARLY WITH ARCLENGTH PHYSICALLY THIS TRANSLATES TO THE RATE OF CHANGE IN ACCELERATION BEING CONSTANT AS YOU TRAVEL AROUND IT SO THE TRANSITION IS NICE AND PREDICTABLE

IT'S SUPER USEFUL WHENEVER YOU NEED SMOOTH TRANSITIONS THIS IS WHY THESE CURVES ARE USED IN GOOD ROAD DESIGN WHEN THEY NEED TO MERGE CURVES

SINCE THEY'RE SO VISUALLY PLEASING THERE'S SOME REALLY COOL RESEARCH ABOUT USING CLOTHOIDS AS THE CANONICAL SPLINE INTERPOLATION CURVE IN COMPUTER GRAPHICS BUT IT NEVER CAUGHT ON BECAUSE BOOZIER AND CUBIC SPLINES ARE SIMPLER CLOTHOIDS LOOK MUCH MORE NATURAL WHICH IS WHY THEY HAVE BEEN USED FOR DESIGNING FRENCH CURVES FOR YEARS IT'S ALSO USED EXTENSIVELY IN VIOLIN DESIGN

IT ALSO SHOWS UP IN OPTICS WHEN YOU ARE DEALING WITH DIFFRACTION AND INTERFERENCE PATTERNS DUE TO AN APERTURE YOU APPROXIMATE YOUR ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD BY A SCALAR COMPLEX VALUED FIELD THAT ENCODES PHASE AND AMPLITUDE INFORMATION AT EVERY POINT IN SPACE IN ORDER TO FIND THE INTENSITY AT ANOTHER POINT IN SPACE YOU NEED TO INTEGRATE OVER THE ENTIRE REGION OF THE APERTURE AND THE CHANGES IN PHASE DUE TO DIFFERENT PATH LENGTHS END UP PRODUCING A CLATHROID SPIRAL WHEN YOU ADD UP THE COMPLEX VALUES ACROSS EVERY POINT IN THE PLANE THEN YOU CAN MOVE BETWEEN THESE PLANES FOR OTHER SURFACES BACK IN THE DAYS PEOPLE USED TO COMPUTE DIFFRACTION USING THE SPIRALS THEMSELVES THE SAME MATH APPLIES TO PATH INTEGRALS SO THIS CAN ALSO BE USED IN QUANTUM MECHANICS

THE CURVE IS ALSO THE SOLUTION TO THE ELASTICA PROBLEM WHICH IS RELATED TO THE GENERAL PROBLEM OF FINDING THE SHAPE THINGS BEND INTO UNDER FORCE EULER HAS COME UP WITH A FAMILY OF SOLUTIONS THAT ARE ALL INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH CLOTHOIDS

SO YEAH IT'S THE COOLEST CURVE
OOHHH MAN I AM A HUGE FAN OF YOUR VIDEOS YOU'RE ACTUALLY ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO INSPIRED ME TO BECOME AN ENGINEER SOMETHING I'M WORKING ON RIGHT NOW THANK YOU FOR MAKING THESE VIDEOS
DESTIN YOU'RE AWESOME I WISH MORE PEOPLE ARE MORE INTO SCIENCE LIKE YOU KEEP UP THE YOUTUBE VIDEOS I AM A FAN
ANYTIME I'M STRUGGLING IN SCHOOL I WATCH HIS VIDEOS SUCH AN AMAZING ATTITUDE FOR LEARNING
OHHHHH MAN I'M SO JEALOUS I'D DONATE MY LEFT KIDNEY FOR ONE OF THESE FLIGHTS
I LOVE YOU AND YOUR CHANNEL
THAT'S ONE MORE THAN I THOUGHT THEY HAD
US LEFT WITH JUST ONE WORKING FUSION REACTOR

THAT IS JUST PLAIN INCORRECT EVEN IF YOU LIMIT THINGS TO ONLY MAGNETIC CONFINEMENT DEVICES IGNORE THE MANY INERTIAL CONFINEMENT EXPERIMENTS AT THE NATIONAL LABS AND A NUMBER OF PRIVATE STARTUP COMPANIES THERE ARE STILL MANY IN OPERATION IN THE US

HYBRID ILLINOIS DEVICE FOR RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS CHIDRA AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS

HELICALLY SYMMETRIC EXPERIMENT DSX AT THE UNIVERSITY OF

MADISON SYMMETRIC TORUS MST AT THE UNIVERSITY OF

AT GENERAL ATOMICS

PEGASUS TOROIDAL EXPERIMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF


I'M SO HAPPY I'M LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE WORKING ON I DO WISH THE US FUNDED FUSION PLASMA RESEARCH AT HOME MORE THOUGH THE ABLATOR C SHUTDOWN MAKES ME SAD
HOW IS FUSION EVER GOING TO MAKE NET ENERGY CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN THAT
I WOULD RATHER SEE THEM TAKE ALL THE SUBSIDIES AWAY FROM POISONOUS FISSION NUKE PLANTS AND PUT THAT MONEY INTO FUSION RESEARCH PHASE FISSION OUT

WE'VE REALLY GOT OUR PRIORITIES BACKWARDS
DOES IT WORK AT COLD TEMPERATURES
WHAT GOOD WERE THE OTHER REACTORS WHAT THE FUCK IS SO COOL ABOUT THIS ONE ANOTHER REASON WHY WE NEED LOWER TAXES
THIS CAN BE A CONFUSING ISSUE FOR EXAMPLE CRAIG CALLENDER AT UC SAN DIEGO WROTE WHEN WE LOOK TO COSMOLOGY FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE ACTUAL PAST STATE WE FIND EARLY COSMOLOGICAL STATES THAT APPEAR TO BE STATES OF VERY HIGH ENTROPY NOT VERY LOW ENTROPY COSMOLOGY TELLS US THAT THE EARLY UNIVERSE IS AN ALMOST HOMOGENEOUS ISOTROPIC STATE OF APPROXIMATELY UNIFORM TEMPERATURE I EAST A VERY HIGH ENTROPY STATE AND PAUL DAVIES NOW AT U OF ARIZONA WROTE AT FIRST SIGHT IT APPEARS PARADOXICAL THAT AN ELEMENT OF THE COSMOLOGICAL FLUID CAN START OUT IN A CONDITION AND YET STILL INCREASE IN ENTROPY AT LATER EPOCH BUT ROGER PENROSE IN THE LATE ARGUED THAT IN THE EARLY UNIVERSE A HIGH ENTROPY STATE IS NOT SMOOTH AT ALL BUT AN INHOMOGENEOUS ONE THE DENSITY OF MATTER IS LARGE AND GRAVITY IS HUGELY IMPORTANT

SO IN THE VIDEO SEAN CARROLL EXPLAINS WHY THE EARLY UNIVERSE IS A STATE ALONG THE WAY TALKING ABOUT GRAVITATIONAL EFFECTS THE JEANS LENGTH ETC

THE MOST RELEVANT PAPER I COULD FIND ON THIS TOPIC QUICK SEARCH IS ENTROPY AND GRAVITY THE ABOVE CALLENDER AND DAVIES QUOTES ARE FROM THIS PAPER
ERR ALTHOUGH I AGREE WITH MOST OF WHAT HE IS SAYING I THINK HE GOOFED BY CLAIMING THAT GRAVITATIONAL DEGREES OF FREEDOM ARE NOT TRUE DEGREES OF FREEDOM THEY MOST CERTAINLY ARE AND THAT WAS WHOLE POINT THE GRAVITATIONAL DEGREES OF FREEDOM THAT ARE TRULY INDEPENDENT FROM THE MATTER DEGREES OF FREEDOM ARE THOSE QUANTIFIED BY THE WEYL CONFORMAL TENSOR WHICH WAS IN FACT VERY CLOSE TO ZERO ALL COMPONENTS NEAR THE BIG BANG THIS IS EXACTLY WHY PENROSE ALWAYS ARGUED THAT THERE SHOULD BE A WAY OF DIRECTLY RELATING WEYL CURVATURE TO GRAVITATIONAL ENTROPY

OR AM I MISSING SOMETHING
HE WROTE A BOOK ABOUT IT FROM ETERNITY TO HERE IT'S PROBABLY ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS ON THE TOPIC
FEINSTEIN IS NOT GOING TO LIKE THIS
AWESOME LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS
ARE THERE ANY PRE REQUISITES ONE SHOULD BRUSH UP ON BEFORE ATTEMPTING THIS OR WILL MATH SKILLS GET ME THROUGH IT MO KNOWLEDGE MO BITCHES AMBRITE
DAMN IF ONLY I WASN'T STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL THIS WOULD BE ONE OF THE COOLEST THINGS I'VE EVER SEEN
DID A LITTLE DIGGING FOR YOU ANYTHING YOU WANT TO KNOW IS LIKELY FOUND HERE

NOTE IT IS FROM BUT I IMAGINE NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED AS FAR AS WHAT YOU ASKED GOES

I AM A NEW FELLOW AND IN MY APPLICATION I PROPOSED A SPECIFIC RESEARCH PROJECT DO I NOW HAVE TO DO THAT SPECIFIC PROJECT

NO NOT AS LONG AS YOUR DEGREE PROGRAM AND RESEARCH PROJECT BOTH REMAIN IN THE SAME MAJOR FOS PROPOSED IN YOUR APPLICATION AND THERE IS NO MINOR FOS CHANGE IF THERE IS A MINOR FOS CHANGE IN EITHER THE DEGREE PROGRAM OR RESEARCH PROJECT IT IS SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE CO USING THE GREP FASTLAND MODULE
FELLOW HERE NO YOU'RE NOT AT ALL OBLIGATED TO OR EVEN EXPECTED TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH YOUR RESEARCH PROPOSAL HELL UNTIL THIS YEAR YOU DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO GO INTO THE SAME FIELD THAT YOU WROTE YOUR PROPOSAL IN FOR INSTANCE SWITCHING FROM PHYSICS TO BIOLOGY YOU CAN STILL GO FROM SUBFIELD TO SUBFIELD SAY CONDENSED MATTER TO ASTROPHYSICS THEY'RE MORE SO INTERESTED IN YOUR ABILITY TO FORMULATE A RESEARCH PROJECT THEY AREN'T LOOKING FOR GROUND BREAKING PROPOSALS JUST A PURELY HYPOTHETICAL ORIGINAL PROJECT THAT WOULD YIELD A SMALL CONTRIBUTION TO YOUR FIELD

IF YOU HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS FEEL FREE TO RESPOND OR PM DEADLINES ARE OBVIOUSLY COMING SOON
I FUCKING LOVE GRUMPY OLD AND HE HAS A POINT TOO IVE SEEN A LOT OF BAD TALKS WHICH SUCKED BECAUSE THE SPEAKER RELIED ON THEIR SLIDES THE BLACKBOARD FORCES YOU TO KNOW YOUR SHIT BY HEART AND BE MORE ENGAGED BUT MAYBE I ONLY THINK THIS BECAUSE IM AN OLD MAN AT HEART TOO
ALL YOU DO IS PRESS BUTTONS RANTS REALLY IRK ME A COMPUTER BASED PRESENTATION GIVES YOU SO MANY TOOLS TO TEACH THAT WERE NOT AVAILABLE BEFORE LIKE SHOWING VIDEOS AND ACCURATELY PORTRAYING DETAILED GRAPHICS IT JUST COMES ACROSS AS THEY GAVE ME THIS INCREASED ABILITY TO PORTRAY INFORMATION TO MY LISTENERS BUT THAT WOULD REQUIRE ME TO EXPAND MY HORIZONS AND TEACH MYSELF SOME NEW TECHNIQUES
UNSURE IF THIS EVEN MAKES SENSE BUT HOW DO WE KNOW TIME ACTUALLY HAS TWO DIRECTIONS IS THERE SUCH A THING AS A DIMENSION WITH ONLY A SINGLE DIRECTION

WHY IS IT THAT WE ARE PUSHED THROUGH TIME BY DEFAULT AT A SPECIFIC RATE IN A WAY WHICH WE ARE NOT PUSHED THROUGH SPACE
THIS REALLY DOESN'T EXPLAIN ANYTHING ABOUT WHY
DELETED

WHAT IS THIS
TO MY MIND IT IS STRANGE THAT QUANTUM MECHANICS IS NOT PROCLAIMED TO SET THE ARROW OF TIME THIS IS MY REASONING

IN ANY CLASSICAL SYSTEM I EAST CLASSICALLY DESCRIBED SYSTEM LIKE A BALL THROWN IN THE AIR SURE THE LAWS DOESN'T CARE ABOUT WHAT DIRECTION TIME RUNS THROW A BALL AND FOLLOWS A PARABOLA SOMEWHAT MODIFIED BY AIR RESISTANCE BOUNCES AS IT HITS THE FLOOR AND ROLLS INTO A CORNER RUNNING TIME BACKWARDS FOR ALL POSITIONS AND MOMENTUMS OF EVERY PARTICLE IN THE SYSTEM WOULD MAKE THE BALL START ROLLING OUT OF THE CORNER BOUNCE A FEW TIMES AND TAKE A PATH OF AN BACK TO YOUR HAND WITH THE CAVEAT THAT ENTROPY SAYS THAT THE LIKELIHOOD OF THAT HAPPENING IS BEYOND GONNA HAPPEN

HOWEVER THIS REASONING SEEMS TO BE FUNDAMENTALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DO IN A QM SYSTEM LET ME USE THE MOST SIMPLE EXAMPLE I CAN THINK OF PUT A WELL LOCALISED PARTICLE IN A BOX AND WAIT FOR SOME GIVEN SUITABLE TIME UNTIL THE PARTICLE HAS A SPREAD OUT SPECTRUM OF SUPERPOSITIONS IN THEN MEASURE THE POSITION OF THE PARTICLE AND YOU WILL INSTANTANEOUSLY COLLAPSE THE WAVE FUNCTION TO BE CONTAINED WITHIN SOME NARROW POSITION INTERVAL IN THE BOX WHERE YOU HAPPEN TO FIND THE PARTICLE NOW WHEN YOU TRY TO RUN THIS SYSTEM BACKWARDS IN TIME LIKE ABOVE YOU'RE UNTIL YOU ENCOUNTER THE MOMENT WHERE THE WAVE FUNCTION COLLAPSED AS TIME WAS RUNNING FORWARDS TO MY KNOWLEDGE THERE IS NO PROCESS THAT CAN INSTANTANEOUSLY A WAVE FUNCTION OR IS THERE

DOES ANYONE SEE WHERE I GO WRONG IN THIS REASONING I'M PRETTY SURE I'M NOT THE FIRST ONE WHO TRIED TO DO THIS ARGUMENT AND GOT THOROUGHLY SHOT DOWN AND HAD TO TUCK THEIR TAIL FIRMLY BETWEEN THEIR LEGS
ENTROPY KASHIRA
THIS WOULD BE QUITE A THREAD IN ANY SUB

YEAH I DON'T BUY IT

IN A BIG CRUNCH SCENARIO WHERE ENTROPY DECREASES WILL TIME FLOW BACKWARDS

NOPE

IN A NEARLY TOTALLY EMPTY ISOLATED SYSTEM WITH ONE ATOM OF CAESIUM WITH NO POSSIBLE INCREASE IN ENTROPY WILL TIME STOP


WOULD IT NOT FLOW FORWARD FOR THE SAME REASON YOU CANNOT GO BACKWARDS IN SPACE OR TRAVEL AT A NEGATIVE SPEED

IN SPACE WHATEVER DIRECTION YOU GO YOU ARE GOING FORWARD WITH VELOCITY WHATEVER DIRECTION THAT VELOCITY IS IT IS ALWAYS FORWARD

IF YOU COULD TRAVEL BACKWARDS IN SPACE AND AT NEGATIVE SPEED YOU COULD HAVE NEGATIVE TIME AND IT WOULD LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME
IS MORSE AND METHODS OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS STILL A GOOD RESOURCE TODAY
I'D LOVE A QUICK A DIRTY DENSITY FUNCTIONAL THEORY SUMMARY RELATING THE MAJOR CODES OF TODAY ASP GAUSSIAN ESPRESSO ETC PSEUDOPOTENTIALS AND THE VARIOUS XC FUNCTIONALS
I'VE BECOME GREATLY INTERESTED IN GEOMETRIC CONCEPTS IN PHYSICS I WOULD LIKE SOME OPINIONS ON THESE TEXT FOR SELF STUDY IF THERE ARE BETTER OPTIONS PLEASE SHARE

FOR A DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY APPROACH FOR CLASSICAL MECHANICS
SALESIAN

FOR A GENERAL SELF STUDY OR REFERENCE BOOK
FRANKEL OR NAKAHARA

FOR APPLICATIONS IN DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY
FECK OR BURKE



ALSO WHAT ARE GOOD TEXTS FOR GEOMETRIC ELECTRODYNAMICS THAT INCLUDES SPIN GEOMETRY
CURRENTLY IN MY FINAL YEAR OF MY UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE I'VE TAKEN A STRONG INTEREST IN MODERN OPTICS AND LASER PHYSICS I'M CURRENTLY TRYING TO DECIDE BETWEEN GOING INTO MEDICAL PHYSICS OR PURSUING OPTICS BUT I SUPPOSE THAT'S IRRELEVANT I WAS WONDERING IF ANYONE KNEW ANY GOOD RESOURCES FOR LASER ENGINEERING OR QUANTUM OPTICS
I'M LOOKING FOR SOME ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ON SOLID STATE PARTICULAR ANY EXCELLENT LECTURE NOTES OR VIDEOS TOPICS WE ARE COVERING SEEM TO BE IN THE ORDER OF KITTEL BUT I HAVE ACCESS TO MARDER AND ASHCROFT MERLIN

I'M ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN THINGS THAT GIVE MORE HISTORICAL CONTEXT AS WELL AS TALK ABOUT BROAD APPLICATIONS SINCE THOSE SORTS OF THINGS HELP ME WITH MEMORY HOOKS
I CURRENTLY A TEACH A COURSE IN MODERN PHYSICS FOR MAJORS I HAVE FINISHED TEACHING RELATIVITY AND QUANTUM PHYSICS AND I PLAN TO TEACH CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS AND STATISTICAL MECHANICS NEXT WHAT BOOKS AND OR ARTICLES WHICH ARE ACCESSIBLE ONLINE WOULD YOU RECOMMEND WHICH GIVES A CONCEPTUAL INTRODUCTION ON THE TWO FIELDS ESPECIALLY ON THE FOLLOWING TOPICS TEMPERATURE ENTROPY AND PHASE CHANGES
I'M TAKING PHYSICS FOR SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS BUT I NEED A BOOK THAT WILL HELP ME SOLVE PROBLEMS SIMILAR TO WHAT WE LEARN IN CLASSICAL THE TEXTBOOK WE USE HAS NUMBERS BUT MOST IN LECTURE MOST PROBLEMS MY PROFESSOR SOLVES WITHOUT NUMBERS

HE SAID EXAMS WON'T HAVE ANY NUMBERS AND IT'LL ALL BE DERIVING EQUATIONS AND WHATNOT FOR EXAMPLE HE WOULD SOMETIMES USE EQUATIONS TO SOLVE FOR THE UNKNOWNS ALL WITHOUT NUMBERS IS THERE A BOOK THAT DOES THINGS SIMILAR TO THAT I REALLY NEED HELP
ANYONE KNOW OF ANY GOOD RESOURCES TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN POPULAR SCIENCE BOOKS AND THE MORE DETAILED MATHEMATICAL KIND I WAS LOOKING AT THE THEORETICAL MINIMUM BOOKS AND THE ROAD TO REALITY ARE THEY GOOD FOR THIS PURPOSE
THE ARTICLE ACTS LIKE WE CAN'T CURRENTLY USE VISIBLE LIGHT IN IMAGING WE ALREADY DO THOUGH IT IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT IS SHOWN HERE IT IS CALLED OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY OCT AND IT RELIES ON BACKSCATTERED LIGHT IT DOES HAVE ISSUES WITH DEPTH BUT YOU CAN GET PICTURES WITH HIGH RESOLUTION
THE FACT IS THERE'S NO THERE THERE THAD ROBERTS DOES NOT HAVE A THEORY HE HAS A COLLECTION OF INTUITIVE IDEAS BASED ON SOME PHYSICS

HE'S PUBLISHED PAPERS ON HIS THEORY HE'S UPLOADED NOTHING TO THE ARXIV THAT I CAN FIND THE FORMALISM SECTION OF HIS WEBSITE IS JUST A VERY QUICK INTRODUCTION TO OR WELL-KNOWN RELATIONS HAVING TO DO WITH BEC ETC PLUS ONE EXTRA THING HE CALLS A NEW GENERALIZATION BUT DOESN'T FULLY DEFINE THERE'S NO COMPLETE MATHEMATICAL FORMALISM GIVEN FOR HOW HIS THEORY WORKS JUST SOME BITS AND PIECES THROWN IN WITH A SHORT HEURISTIC EXPLANATION

I WILL GIVE 2 WELL-KNOWN PROBLEMS WITH THEORIES LIKE THIS ONE FIRST FOR WITH MORE THAN TIME DIMENSION ARE GENERALLY HERE MEANS THAT EITHER A SOLUTION DOES NOT EXIST MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS EXIST OR SOLUTIONS REACT DISCONTINUOUSLY TO SMALL SECOND PROBLEM IS THAT THERE ARE ALREADY STRONG EXPERIMENTAL CONSTRAINTS ON THE SIZE OF ANY ADDITIONAL DIMENSIONS OF SPACE ROBERTS HASN'T SAID EXACTLY HOW HIS EXTRA DIMENSIONS WORK BUT HE HAS TO EXPLAIN EITHER WHY HIS THEORY IS COMPATIBLE WITH THESE RESULTS OR WHY THEY DON'T APPLY I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING THAT ADDRESSES EITHER OF THESE PROBLEMS
WITHOUT HAVING A LOOK AT THE LARGER CODE IT IS HARD TO GIVE YOU A MORE CERTAIN ANSWER HOWEVER I CAN GIVE YOU MY BEST GUESS AS TO WHAT THE CODE SNIPPET YOU POSTED IS ASKING

FIRST OFF ANY LINE BEGINNING WITH IS A COMMENT IN MATALAN AND WON'T BE EXECUTED IN THIS SECTION THERE ARE TWO LINES THAT LET YOU DEFINE WAVELENGTH THE SECOND ONE IS COMMENTED OUT WHEN YOU SPECIFY THE DIMENSIONS OF YOUR PROBLEM YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE A UNIT THE FIRST OPTION IS SETTING
WAVELENGTH

WHICH MEANS THAT ALL OF THE LENGTHS YOU SPECIFY IN YOUR MEASUREMENT NEED TO BE IN UNITS OF THE WAVELENGTH EAST G IF YOUR WAVELENGTH IS AND THE FLAKE YOU ARE SIMULATING IS IN DIAMETER THEN YOU WOULD SPECIFY THAT DIAMETER AS BEING 2 WAVELENGTHS

ALTERNATIVELY YOU CAN SPECIFY EVERYTHING IN SOME OTHER STANDARD UNIT TO DO THAT YOU WOULD COMMENT OUT THE WAVELENGTH LINE AND UNCOMMENTED

WAVELENGTH WAVELENGTH

WHERE WAVELENGTH IS YOUR WAVELENGTH IN NM OR ANY OTHER UNIT AND FOR VACUUM THEN YOU WOULD SPECIFY THE OTHER PARAMETERS OF YOUR SIMULATION IN THE SAME UNITS THAT YOU USED FOR THE WAVELENGTH

THEN WHATEVER RESULTS YOU GET WILL ALSO BE IN WHICHEVER UNITS YOU SELECTION THIS IS BECAUSE MATALAN CANNOT CALCULATE UNITS SO YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT APPROPRIATE UNIT HANDLING IS DONE IN THE SPECIFICATION AND EXECUTION OF THE CODE
MY NEXT QUESTION WOULD BE ON THIS SECTION IT APPEARS TO BE THE SECTION WHERE I SPECIFY PARTICLE SIZE I CAN SEE A VARIABLE RADIUS WHICH I KNOW NOW IS IN UNITS OF WAVELENGTH BUT I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE TWO COMMENTED OUT RADIUS VARIABLES ARE FOR MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THE IMPETUS BEHIND DESIGNING A LOT OF THESE TOOLS WAS TO SIMULATE PARTICLES SUCH AS MY GRAPHITE AND I'M NOT REALLY SURE HOW TO DO THAT HERE

WHAT IS THE IN THERE FOR
THIS HAS BEEN AN ABSOLUTELY SERIOUS PROPOSAL FOR A WHILE BUT IT'S NOW EXCLUDED BECAUSE CONSIDERING WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE INTERGALACTIC MEDIUM IT'S DENSE ENOUGH FOR THE ANNIHILATION ON THE BOUNDARY TO BE VISIBLE AND WE DON'T SEE IT
I DON'T THINK WE COULD TELL APART A ANTIMATTER STAR OR PLANET FROM THE SAME MADE OF NORMAL MATTER

PROBABLY NOT BUT IF THERE ARE REGIONS DOMINATED BY MATTER AND REGIONS DOMINATED BY THEN THERE SHOULD BE SOME PRETTY INTENSE ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT COMING FROM THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE REGIONS AND AS FAR AS I'M AWARE THAT HASN'T BEEN OBSERVED


WE THINK THERE ARE NO ANTIMATTER GALAXIES BECAUSE EVEN THE INTERSTELLAR VACUUM IS NOT ENTIRELY EMPTY PARTICLES EMITTED BY THE STARS IN A GALAXY FORM A SORT OF GALACTIC WIND SIMILAR TO THE INTERSTELLAR WIND BOTH MATTER AND ANTIMATTER GALAXIES SHOULD EMIT GALACTIC WINDS BUT THE WIND EMITTED BY A MATTER GALAXY IS PREDOMINATELY MADE UP OF MATTER AND PHOTONS BUT THEY WILL BE IRRELEVANT FOR THE REST OF MY ARGUMENT WHEREAS AN GALAXY EMITS AN WIND THIS MEANS THAT AT THE POINT WHERE THESE TWO WINDS MEET THERE SHOULD BE CHARACTERISTIC EMISSION FROM ANNIHILATION REACTIONS BUT WE DON'T SEE THAT
WHAT IF WHEN RIGHT AFTER THE BIG BANG THERE WAS A DENSITY FLUCTUATION SO THAT NOW ALL THE ANTIMATTER IS JUST OUTSIDE OF THE OBSERVABLE REGION
WIKI BARYOGENESIS

IN PHYSICAL COSMOLOGY BARYOGENESIS IS THE GENERIC TERM FOR THE HYPOTHETICAL PHYSICAL PROCESSES THAT PRODUCED AN ASYMMETRY IMBALANCE BETWEEN BARYONS AND ANTIBARYON PRODUCED IN THE VERY EARLY UNIVERSE THE BARYONIC MATTER THAT REMAINS TODAY FOLLOWING THE MATTER ANNIHILATION MAKES UP THE UNIVERSE

TOPICS ANTIMATTER

CONSIDER A COIN SPINNING ON A TABLE IT CAN LAND ON ITS HEADS OR ITS TAILS BUT IT CANNOT BE DEFINED AS HEADS OR TAILS UNTIL IT STOPS SPINNING AND FALLS TO ONE SIDE A COIN HAS A CHANCE OF LANDING ON ITS HEAD OR ITS TAIL SO IF ENOUGH COINS ARE SPUN IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY HALF SHOULD LAND ON HEADS AND THE OTHER HALF ON TAILS IN THE SAME WAY HALF OF THE OSCILLATING PARTICLES IN THE EARLY UNIVERSE SHOULD HAVE DECAYED AS MATTER AND THE OTHER HALF AS ANTIMATTER

HOWEVER IF A SPECIAL KIND OF MARBLE ROLLED ACROSS A TABLE OF SPINNING COINS AND CAUSED EVERY COIN IT HIT TO LAND ON ITS HEAD IT WOULD DISRUPT THE WHOLE SYSTEM THERE WOULD BE MORE HEADS THAN TAILS IN THE SAME WAY SOME UNKNOWN MECHANISM COULD HAVE INTERFERED WITH THE OSCILLATING PARTICLES TO CAUSE A SLIGHT MAJORITY OF THEM TO DECAY AS MATTER PHYSICISTS MAY FIND HINTS AS TO WHAT THIS PROCESS MIGHT BE BY STUDYING THE SUBTLE DIFFERENCES IN THE BEHAVIOUR OF MATTER AND ANTIMATTER PARTICLES CREATED IN PROTON COLLISIONS AT THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER STUDYING THIS IMBALANCE COULD HELP SCIENTISTS PAINT A CLEARER PICTURE OF WHY OUR UNIVERSE IS
THEORISTS WITH DOING PHS ESPECIALLY PARTICLE ASTROPARTICLE COSMOLOGY WHAT KIND OF QUESTIONS DID YOU GET ASKED IN YOUR PHD INTERVIEWS I HAVE MINE COMING UP SOON AND AM LOOKING INTO HOW TO BEST PREPARE I REALISE THEY'LL ASK ME ABOUT MY INTERESTS AND UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH BUT MORE WONDERING WHAT KIND OF PHYSICKY QUESTIONS THEY ASK AND IF I'M GONNA BE SOLVING PROBLEMS ON THE SPOT ETC ONLY APPLYING TO UK UNIVERSITIES
WHAT MAKES YOU PASSIONATE ABOUT YOUR FIELD OF RESEARCH OR PUT ANOTHER WAY WHY SHOULD A GRAD STUDENT GO INTO YOUR FIELD
CAN YOU SORT IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE THIS LIST FOR AN INTERNATIONAL STUDENT THAT IS INTERESTED IN DOING A PHD IN PHYSICS IN THE US

PHYSICS GRE SCORE
GENERAL GRE VERBAL SCORE
GENERAL GRE QUANTITATIVE SCORE
GENERAL GRE WRITING SCORE

ALSO WHAT'S BETTER BETWEEN

GOOD LETTER FROM A PROFESSOR
DECENT LETTER FROM A MORE FAMOUS PROFESSOR

BASICALLY MY SITUATION IS THIS I CAN TAKE A GOOD AGRE AND TOEFL SCORE A BAD VERBAL AVERAGE WRITING AND GOOD QUANTITATIVE GRE SCORE BUT I HAVE NO RESEARCH EXPERIENCE BUT I'M TAKING A MASTER DEGREE NOT SURE IF THIS IS THE CORRECT WORD BASICALLY HERE IN ITALY YOU TAKE YOUR FIRST BASIC DEGREE AFTER YEARS AND YOU CAN TAKE A MASTER DEGREE IN TWO MORE YEARS

THE BIGGEST PROBLEM FOR ME IS WITH THE LETTERS THERE AREN'T MANY THEORETICAL PHYSICIST PROFESSORS IN MY UNIVERSITY AND ANOTHER GUY ALREADY ASKED THEM FOR A LETTER I'VE SPOKE WITH THEM AND THEY SAID THAT IF THEY WRITE A LETTER FOR ME TOO THEY'LL HAVE TO WRITE A WORSE LETTER THAN HIM SINCE HE'S MORE KNOWN AMONG PROFESSORS THIS BASICALLY MEANS THAT IF ME AND THIS OTHER DUDE GET THE SAME SCORES AND EVERYTHING THEY'LL PROBABLY CHOSE HIM INSTEAD OF ME

THANKS
I'M A FRESHMAN PHYSICS MATHEMATICS DOUBLE MAJOR THOUGH PHYSICS IS DEFINITELY MY MAIN INTEREST MY UNIVERSITY HAS AN EXTREMELY GOOD MATH DEPARTMENT AND I'LL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE COURSES IF I WISH IN FUTURE YEARS

I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN PARTICLE PHYSICS PROBABLY THEORY WHAT TWO OR THREE MATH FIELDS WOULD BE MOST HELPFUL TO PURSUE IN HOPE OF A FUTURE CAREER IN THEORETICAL PARTICLE PHYSICS

FOR REFERENCE HERE IS THE LIST OF MATHEMATICS COURSES OFFERED BY MY UNIVERSITY
I'M A JUNIOR PHYSICS MATH DOUBLE MAJOR CURRENTLY HAVING AN IDENTITY CRISIS APPLYING FOR SCHOLARSHIPS HAS REALLY MADE ME QUESTION IF GRAD SCHOOL IS SOMETHING I WANT TO PURSUE I HAVE GREAT GRADES GA AND ASTRONOMY RESEARCH EXPERIENCE BUT I HAVE YET TO HAVE A MOMENT WHERE I KNOW I NEED TO GO TO GRAD SCHOOL TO LEARN MORE ABOUT INSERT SOMETHING HERE I'M INTERESTED IN MOST OF MY PHYSICS COURSES AND ENJOY MATH PROGRAMMING BUT I DON'T WANT TO DEFAULT INTO DOING A PHD BECAUSE OF THE HUGE TIME COMMITMENT I DONT THINK I CAN COMMIT YEARS OF MY LIFE UNLESS IM FULLY INVESTED I KNOW STILL HAVE TIME TO FIGURE ALL OF THIS OUT BUT FRANKLY NOT KNOWING WHAT I WILL BE DOING AFTER I GRADUATE UNDERGRAD OR EVEN GRAD SCHOOL IS STRESSING ME OUT ANY LIFE ADVICE
NEXT SEMESTER I'LL BE ENTERING MY FINAL TERM OF UNDERGRAD AND WILL BE TAKING STAT MECH GENERAL RELATIVITY PARTICLE PHYSICS QUANTUM MECHANICS 2 AND DOING MY THESIS WHICH IS REALLY JUST ME LEARNING STRING THEORY VIA ZWIEBACKS BOOK

SO FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE I CAN REMEMBER I WON'T BE TAKING A MATH COURSE WHICH KINDA BUMS ME OUT SO MY QUESTION IS DO YOU GUYS THINK IT WOULD BE WORTH IT TO ADD ON A TOPOLOGY COURSE ON TOP OF ALL THIS IT SOUNDS LIKE A COOL COURSE AND GIVEN THAT I WANT TO DO THEORETICAL PHYSICS I FEEL IT WOULD BE A RELEVANT COURSE TO TAKE I'M JUST WORRIED IT WILL BE A LOT ON MY PLATE
HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD MAJOR IN PHYSICS PHYSICS CLASSES ARE TOUGH I LOVE PHYSICS I REALLY DO AT NIGHT I FALL ASLEEP LISTENING TO LECTURES BY FEYNMAN SUSSKIND SEAN CARROL AND PHYSICS PODCASTS I HAVE ENJOYED THE PHYSICS CLASSES I'VE TAKEN AM TAKING SO FAR CLASSICAL MECHANICS ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM BUT THE CLASSES ARE A REAL STRUGGLE FOR ME EACH LECTURE I FEEL VERY CONFUSED WITH ALL OF THESE EQUATIONS AND LAWS THROWN AT ME I READ THE BOOK DO PRACTICE PROBLEMS WHICH I HAVE TO FORCE MYSELF TO DO ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES I ENJOY IT I NEVER FEEL I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND ANYTHING I'M LUCKY IF I UNDERSTAND HALF OF WHAT ALL OF THIS STUFF TRULY MEANS THE TESTS QUIZ QUESTIONS OFTEN INVOLVE THINGS I'VE NEVER SEEN IN THE HOMEWORK OR READ IN BOOKS WHICH IS A DIFFERENT FEELING THAN IN ANY OTHER CLASS I'VE TAKEN I'M A COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT ABOUT TO TRANSFER NEXT YEAR AND I SEND MY UC APPLICATIONS IN OCTOBER I RECEIVED AN A IN MECHANICS WHICH DISAPPOINTINGLY I DIDN'T LIKE AND GOT A ON MY FIRST E M TEST WHICH I REALLY REALLY LIKE TO ALL OF YOU PHYSICISTS PHYSICS STUDENTS IS THIS LIFELONG CONFUSION JUST SOMETHING YOU GET USED TO OR DOES A TRUE PHYSICIST FEEL LIKE THESE CLASSES ARE A BREEZE IS PHYSICS JUST TAUGHT IN A DIFFERENT WAY HAS MY BRAIN REACHED ITS LIMIT OF UNDERSTANDING I FEEL LIKE I AM BEING PUSHED PAST THE LIMIT OF MY KNOWLEDGE PLEASE GUYS JUST GIVE ME YOUR HONEST FEEDBACK THANKS
HOW HARD IS STUDYING REALLY AND HOW HARD IS THE JOB AFTER

DID ANYONE WITH CHRONIC PAIN MANAGE TO GET THROUGH STUDIES TO KEEP WORKING IN THE PHYSICS FIELD

I AM ASKING BECAUSE I HAVE STRESS RELATED CHRONIC PAIN AND I CAN'T DEAL WITH THE APPARENT AMOUNT OF EFFORT REQUIRED TO GET THROUGH UNI AND GET A DEGREE IN PHYSICS SO I DOUBT THAT WORKLIFE WILL BE ANY EASIER

I POSTED MY QUESTION ALSO HERE

EDIT PS I DO LOVE PHYSICS
WILL I EVER BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR RESEARCH IN MY SECOND YEAR PHYSICS COURSE RESEARCH SKILLS WE ARE SUPPOSED TO READ ORIGINAL PAPER ON DETERMINING H USING THE PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT AND COMMENT ON IT I'D BE LYING IF I SAID I UNDERSTOOD A SINGLE THING OUT OF THAT PAPER EITHER I AM NOT GOOD ENOUGH PHYSICS RESEARCH OR OUR PROF IS MAKING US DO SOMETHING WAY ABOVE OUR CURRENT LEVEL IT FEELS RIDICULOUS THAT I AM ABLE TO DO ALL THE ACTUAL MATH AND PHYSICS IN MY OTHER COURSES AND YET READING THIS THING IS IMPOSSIBLE ANYONE HAVE ANY INSIGHT
WHICH FIELD HAS MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE DISCOVERY ASTROPHYSICS OR QUANTUM PHYSICS
MATHEMATICS
COMPUTER SCIENCE COGNITIVE SCIENCE MAJOR HERE AI IS LESS ABOUT USING CS TO UNDERSTAND THE BRAIN AND MORE ABOUT USING THE BRAIN AND OTHER NATURAL PROCESSES AS INSPIRATION FOR CREATING EFFECTIVE STATISTICAL MODELS
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS PROBABLY A DOUBLE MAJOR ONE IN BIOLOGY BIOCHEM WITH A NEURO SPECIALIZATION IF OFFERED AT YOUR SCHOOL AND THE SECOND MAJOR IN EITHER COMPUTER SCIENCE OR STATISTICS MATHEMATICS

UNLESS YOU'RE INTERESTED IN AI FOR SAKE LIKE ME THEN COMPESCE COGSCI IS THE WAY TO GO ALSO A LOT OF SCHOOLS OFFER YEAR MASTERS PROGRAMS FOR UNDERGRADS IN CERTAIN FIELDS MIGHT BE WORTH LOOKING INTO
DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN SPECIFICALLY A PHYSICS DEGREE COULD BE MORE THAN JUST INDIRECTLY RELEVANT THERE'S A REASON THE COST FUNCTION YOU MINIMIZE IN LEARNING IS REFERRED TO AS AN ENERGY LANDSCAPE

SOME ADVICE I'VE CONSISTENTLY HEARD GIVEN BY PROFS AND GRAD STUDENTS OVER AT THE COG SCI DEPARTMENT TO STARRY EYED UNDERGRADS IS TO GET AS MUCH STATISTICS AND MATH UNDER THEIR BELTS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

LOOK AT WHO'S WORKING AT YOUR INSTITUTION WHO DO YOU LIKE

THERE ARE LOTS OF PHYSICS PEOPLE WHO WORK WORKED IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE A FEW OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD WOULD BE JOHN TOPSFIELD TERRY SEJNOWSKI LARRY ABBOTT HENRY ABARBANEL SEBASTIAN KEUNG TATYANA SHARPE DAVID KLEINFELD HAIM SOMPOLINSKI CHRISTOFF KOCH ALAN LITKE DANIELLE BASSETT

COGNITIVE SCIENCE MIGHT BE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR PHYSICS PROBABLY ISN'T THE MOST RELEVANT DEGREE IF THAT'S YOUR MAIN INTEREST
THIS INTUITION IS BASED ON THE OLD QUANTUM THEORY PARTICULARLY THE QUANTIZATION RULE

AS A TECHNICAL POINT THOUGH THIS KIND OF QUANTIZATION RULE ONLY WORKS FOR SYSTEMS THAT SATISFY A CERTAIN CONDITION WHICH WE CALL INTEGRABILITY SYSTEMS LIKE THE HELIUM ATOM DON'T OBEY THIS RULE IN THE SAME WAY ALTHOUGH THIS HAS NO EFFECT ON ARGUMENT

I THINK THE AUTHOR MAY BE A BIT CONFUSED ABOUT THE HISTORY HERE THOUGH OR MAYBE I AM SOME PEOPLE HAVE MADE THIS KIND OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM QUANTIZATION ARGUMENT BUT THAT WASN'T ORIGINAL ARGUMENT HIS ARGUMENT BASICALLY INTRODUCED 2 DIFFERENT WAYS TO REPRESENT THE WAVEFUNCTION OF AN ELECTRON NEAR A MAGNETIC MONOPOLE AND THERE'S A REGION IN THE PROBLEM WHERE BOTH REPRESENTATIONS SHOULD BE VALID BUT IN ORDER FOR THE 2 WAVEFUNCTIONS TO AGREE WITH EACH OTHER IN THAT REGION HE NEEDED A QUANTIZATION CONDITION FOR THE PRODUCT OF THE ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC CHARGES
WIKI

FROM THE REFERENCES IN THE ABOVE ARTICLE
PAUL DIRAC QUANTIZED SINGULARITIES IN THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD PROCEEDINGS ROYAL SOCIETY LONDON A

THIS LINK IS FROM THE ABOVE REFERENCES BUT DOESN'T WORK FOR ME
CONTENT
IN THE PRESENCE OF A SPHERICAL POTENTIAL THE ORBITAL ANGULAR MOMENTUM IS QUANTIZED THIS FALLS DIRECTLY OUT OF THE MATH LEGENDRE POLYNOMIALS THE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS ARE PERIODIC BECAUSE OF THE WAVE NATURE OF THE ELECTRON AND THE REASONABLE DEMAND THAT THE WAVEFUNCTION MUST BE SQUARE INTEGRABLE ALL THE QUANTUM NUMBERS ARE DERIVED DIRECTLY FROM THE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS AND THE MATHEMATICS REMEMBER THE ORBITALS DESCRIBE TIME INDEPENDENT STATIONARY STATES

EQUATION DESCRIBES A FREE ELECTRON IN THE ABSENCE OF A POTENTIAL WHERE THE TIME AND SPACE COMPONENTS ARE SYMMETRICAL SO IT APPLY HERE EQ IS FIRST ORDER IN TIME AND 2ND ORDER IN SPACE ALSO PERIODIC BOUNDARY CONDITIONS APPLY TO ALL ATOMIC MOLECULAR STATIONARY STATES INCLUDING HE ORBITALS SO I AM NOT SURE WHAT THE PREVIOUS COMMENT WAS ALLUDING TO SOMETIMES PHYSICISTS KNOW SQUAT ABOUT REAL ATOMS AND MOLECULES
RANDOMNESS MEANS THAT WHEN STUDYING SOME SYSTEM THE BEST POSSIBLE PREDICTION WE CAN MAKE USING ALL THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SYSTEM THAT EXIST WILL BE A PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION NOT A FIXED SINGLE OUTCOME IT'S IMPORTANT HERE THAT I WRITE ALL THE INFORMATION THAT EXIST SINCE IT IMPLIES THAT WE GET A PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION SIMPLY BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THE WORLD WORKS AND NOT BECAUSE THAT THERE'S SOMETHING WE DON'T KNOW THAT'S HOW WE KNOW IT'S RANDOM I GUESS THEN IT SORT OF BECOMES A QUESTION ABOUT WHAT PROBABILITY MEANS TO WHICH THERE ARE DIFFERENT SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT LIKE FREQUENTEST OR BAYESIAN TO NAME TWO COMMON ONES

NOTE THAT THE WHOLE QUESTION SOMEHOW DEPENDS ON YOUR INTERPRETATION OF QM WHETHER OR NOT MY EXPLANATION ABOVE MAKES SENSE DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU BELIEVE ABOUT HOW QM WORKS IN PARTICULAR IT ONLY MAKES SENSE IF WHAT WE CAN KNOW ABOUT THE SYSTEM IS THE SAME AS ALL INFORMATION THAT EXISTS ABOUT IT I EAST IF THERE IS NO INFORMATION THAT WE CAN'T LEARN OR IN OTHER WORDS NO HIDDEN VARIABLES THERE ARE INTERPRETATIONS THAT SAY THAT SUCH HIDDEN INFORMATION DOES EXIST I EAST BOEHMIAN MECHANICS AND THEN THERE IS NO RANDOMNESS WE JUST CAN'T PREDICT PERFECTLY BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING HOWEVER BECAUSE OF BELL INEQUALITIES YOU INSTEAD HAVE TO HAVE WHICH TO MOST PHYSICISTS SEEMS LIKE A REALLY BAD IDEA


ANOTHER WAY MY EXPLANATION CAN FAIL IS IF YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE IS MORE THAN ONE OUTCOME I EAST WHAT IF EVERY POSSIBLE OUTCOME ACTUALLY HAPPENS THIS IS THE STORY OF THE INTERPRETATION WHERE AGAIN THERE IS NO RANDOMNESS BUT NOW NOT BECAUSE OF HIDDEN INFORMATION BUT BECAUSE THE BRANCHING OF THE UNIVERSE
RANDOMNESS ARISES IN EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS EXPERIMENTS IN THE QUANTUM DOMAIN ARE OBSERVED TO HAVE RANDOM OUTCOME THE EXPLANATORY STRUCTURE OF THE THEORY OF QUANTUM MECHANICS DOES NOT PROVIDE A MEANS TO REFINE THE EXPERIMENT TO REMOVE THE RANDOMNESS REPEATING AN EXPERIMENT A LARGE NUMBER OF TIME WILL DEMONSTRATE A DISTRIBUTIONAL STRUCTURE TO THE RANDOMNESS BUT THERE IS NO PATH GIVEN IN THE THEORETICAL EXPLANATION TO FURTHER REDUCE THE EXPERIMENT TO ARRIVE AT A DETERMINISTIC OUTCOME FOR A SINGLE EXPERIMENT
THEY WOULD THEREFORE PRESENT A SIMILAR OBSERVATIONAL SIGNATURE TO THAT OF MASSIVE COMPACT HALO OBJECTS OR MACHOS WHICH WERE SUGGESTED AS A DARK MATTER CANDIDATE IN THE AND RULED OUT BY OBSERVATIONAL SEARCHES

INTERESTING TO HEAR I'VE HEARD TALK OF MACHOS GETTING A SECOND LOOK AFTER THE GRAVITATIONAL WAVE DETECTION LOOKS LIKE A RED HERRING
I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION BUT MY EXPERIENCE WITH HERBAL SPACE PROGRAM SUGGESTS THAT ANYTHING THAT ENTERS DEEP ENOUGH WITHIN THE ATMOSPHERE I WOULD ESTIMATE SOME KM ABOVE GROUND IS NOT GOING TO COME OUT AGAIN
THE MOMENTUM OF SUCH AN OBJECT IS SO HUGE THAT THERE IS VERY LITTLE CHANGE IN VELOCITY FOR AN OBJECT PASSING THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE THIS IS TRUE FOR OBJECTS ROUGHLY A KM OR SO IN DIAMETER THE SURFACE AREA TO VOLUME RATIO OF THE OBJECT IS INSUFFICIENT FOR THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH IS LESS DENSE TO CHANGE THE OBJECTS MOMENTUM VELOCITY HOWEVER IT WOULD BE VERY BRIGHT AND MANY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DEGREES AND THUS FLASH FRY ANYTHING WITHIN LINE OF SIGHT THESE TEMPERATURES ARE HIGH ENOUGH TO DISASSOCIATE THE MOLECULAR COMPONENTS OF THE ATMOSPHERE AND RESULT IN TOXIC AMOUNTS OF NITROUS OXIDE EVEN FOR SMALL OBJECTS THE FLUENCE IS MANY TIMES HIGHER THAN THAT OF THE SUN AND BURNS STUFF OVER BROAD AREAS THE RECENT RUSSIAN METEORITE APARTMENT BUILDING SIZE CAUSED SECOND DEGREE BURNS AND WAS BRIGHTER THAN THE SUN FOR KM OR SO FOR A HUGE OBJECT I AM NOT SURE HOW MUCH THERMAL AND KINETIC ENERGY WOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO THE ATMOSPHERE BUT IN ANY EVENT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE CATASTROPHIC OVER A CONTINENT SIZED AREA
IT IS POSSIBLE THE BIGGER THE ASTEROID THE LOWER IT CAN GO THE ATMOSPHERE DOESN'T HAVE A FIXED END ANYWAY ALL THE SATELLITES IN LOW EARTH ORBIT ARE FLYING THROUGH THE VERY THIN OUTER LAYERS OF OUR ATMOSPHERE AND CAN DO SO FOR YEARS

NOT REALLY WINDY MORE AS THE ASTEROID WOULD GO THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE WITH A SPEED OF AT LEAST KM S TYPICALLY WITH TENS OF KM S THERE IS NOTHING TO IGNITE SOME OF THE FRONT OF THE ASTEROID WOULD EVAPORATE IF THE ASTEROID GOES LOW ENOUGH PEOPLE LIVING NEAR ITS PATH WILL BE VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE RESULTS DEPENDING ON THE SIZE AND LOWEST POINT OF THE ASTEROID
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE REPLIES EVERYONE THEY WERE QUITE INFORMATIVE
HERE ARE THE VARIABLES YOU NEED TO LOOK AT TO SOLVE YOUR QUESTION
SIZE DOESN'T MATTER IT ALL ABOUT DENSITY AND MASSACHUSETTS
2 THE LAW OF ATTRACTION SAYS THAT IF TWO BODIES ARE IN A VACUUM AND THEY HAVE ENOUGH MASS TO ATTRACT EACH OTHER THEY WILL COLLIDE OVER TIME

ANSWER SO LET'S SAY THIS ASTEROID GETS BUMPED AND STARTS ITS TRIP TOWARD EARTH PASSES INTO THE SPHERE OF INFLUENCE OF EARTH IF WE ARE LUCKY THE MOON WILL TAKE THE HIT AND PULL THE ASTEROID AWAY FROM US BUT IF THE ASTEROID IS TOO FAST THE MOON WILL JUST CHANGE ITS COURSE
SLIGHTLY NOW TO THE SAD PART MATHEMATICALLY ONCE AN OBJECT THAT SIZES LET'S SAY THE SIZE OF AISA FOR EXAMPLE COMES AT US THERE'S NO DODGING IT IT WOULD HIT THE EARTH MOST LIKELY IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN THE ASTEROID WOULD ENTER THE ATMOSPHERE AND GENERATE SO MUCH AIR FRICTION IT WOULD VAPORISE WATER AND THE OZONE THE FORCE OF THE IMPACT WOULD SEND THE TECTONIC PLATES INTO A FREE FOR ALL AND TSUNAMIS WOULD COVER ALMOST OF THE LAND MASSACHUSETTS THE END OF ALL MANKIND AND LIFE ON EARTH NUCLEAR WINTER FOR A FEW DECADES VOLCANIC ACTIVITY ALL OVER THE GLOBE


HERE IS HIS ORIGINAL PAPER IN GERMAN BUT YOU CAN COPY AND PASTE AND FIX SOME TRANSCRIPTION ERRORS AND LET GOOGLE TRANSLATE DO THE WORK FOR YOU
SPIRALS IN GALAXIES AREN'T STATIC FEATURES BUT DENSITY WAVES
THE SIMPLEST EXPLANATION IS TO ASSERT THAT THE ORBITAL VELOCITY OF A STAR IN A GALAXY DECLINES AS A FUNCTION OF ITS DISTANCE FROM THE CENTER OF MASSACHUSETTS GIVEN THAT SIMPLE RULE MORE FORMALLY EXPRESSED MATHEMATICALLY OF COURSE IMAGINE A CONFIGURATION OF STARS THAT INITIALLY LOOKS LIKE THIS

















NOW IMAGINE SOMETHING THAT I WON'T TRY TO DRAW CONSISTENT WITH THE RULES OF ORBITAL MECHANICS THE SYSTEM'S MEMBER STARS COMMENCE ORBITING THE CENTER OF MASSACHUSETTS THE STARS NEARER THE CENTER HAVE HIGHER ORBITAL VELOCITIES THAN THE STARS FARTHER AWAY THIS DIFFERENTIAL ROTATION CREATES A SPIRAL VERY SIMPLE AND INTUITIVE

IF INSTEAD OF SOME STRAIGHT LINES AS IN THIS DIAGRAM YOU HAVE SOME RANDOM CLUMPS OF MATTER AND THE SAME ORBITAL MECHANICS OVER TIME YOU ALSO GET A SPIRAL DUE TO DIFFERENTIAL VELOCITIES

AS IT TURNS OUT IN REAL GALAXIES NOT MATHEMATICAL MODELS THE STARS DISTANT FROM THE CENTER ORBIT FASTER THAN THEY OUGHT TO BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF VISIBLE MATTER WHICH HAS LED TO THE THEORY OF DARK MATTER MATTER THAT DOESN'T ABSORB OR EMIT LIGHT BUT THAT INTERACTS GRAVITATIONALLY WITH THE MATTER AROUND IT
I'M GUESSING THAT STYROFOAM SHIELDING IS MORE COST EFFECTIVE YOU CAN'T GO OUTSIDE ON MARS ANYWAY
IT'S FEASIBLE FOR A SMALL SPACECRAFT AS DISCUSSED IN THIS PAPER HOWEVER SOME OF THEIR RESULTS ARE DEPENDENT ON BEING IN VACUUM BUT IT WOULD BE A LOT EASIER TO BUILD A GIANT SUPERCONDUCTING COIL ON THE GROUND IF NECESSARY FOR A MARTIAN BASE

IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE TO CONSTRUCT A SET OF COILS RUNNING LATITUDINALLY I CAN'T FIND IT BUT THERE'S A PAPER DISCUSSING THE NECESSARY CURRENT AND SIZE OF THE COILS AND IT ENDS UP BEING SOMETHING LIKE A SET OF TEN COILS WRAPPING AROUND THE ENTIRE EARTH AT DIFFERENT LATITUDES EACH A METER IN DIAMETER

EDIT I FOUND THE PAPER
WHILE POSSIBLE IT WOULD BE CHEAPER AND EASIER IN THE LONG RUN JUST TO BUILD A HABITAT COVERED BY A FEW METERS OF SOIL AND ROCK THIS WOULD ALLOW THE ELECTRICAL POWER THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN USED ON SUCH A SHIELD TO BE PUT TO OTHER MORE PRODUCTIVE USES
MARS ALREADY HAS SMALL LOCALIZED MAGNETIC FIELDS MAY BE BETTER TO FIND ONE OF THESE
ID LIKE TO SEE THE MATH BUT I'VE BEEN OUT OF SCHOOL WAY TOO LONG FOR IT I SEE SOME POSTS ABOUT LOCALIZE MAGNETIC FIELDS ONE POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT THE EARTHS FIELD ISN'T SUPER STRONG BUT IT IS BIG SO WHEN THE FIELD IS AROUND THE PLANET INCOMING COSMIC RAYS DON'T NEED TO BE DEFLECTED THAT MUCH WHEN IT HAPPENS MILES AWAY HOWEVER IS THE FIELD IS ONLY AROUND THE COLONY AND SAY JUST S OF FEET AWAY IT WOULD NEED A BIGGER DEFLECTION TO BE EFFECTIVE
WELL REMEMBER THAT MAGNETIC FIELDS DISSIPATE AS R 2 IF YOU WANT TO MAINTAIN A MAGNETIC SHIELD BIG ENOUGH TO COVER A SETTLEMENT THAT IS A LOT OF MAGNETIC FIELD YOU COULD COVER MOST OF A DOME WITH THEM BUT THAT IS A LOT OF SUPERCONDUCTING MATERIAL A LOT OF LIQUID NITROGEN HELIUM TO KEEP IT SUPERCONDUCTING THAT GETS EXPENSIVE REAL QUICK EVEN ON THE SCALE OF A MARS MISSION

I'M TOO LAZY TO DO THE CALCULATIONS OF HOW STRONG A FIELD YOU WOULD NEED BUT I'M BETTING IT WOULD BE PRETTY STRONG O
I'M IGNORANT HOW DO FIND THE ENERGY SPECTRUM OF RADIATION ONE WOULD FIND ON MARS ONCE I KNOW WHAT'S THERE I'LL TELL YOU HOW TO SHIELD IT

SHORT ANSWER IS TO DIG A HOLE AND LIVE UNDERGROUND

IF THEY JUST SPIN THE PLANET FASTER IT WILL CREATE A STRONGER MAGNETIC FIELD
ESSENTIALLY IT'S NOT REALLY EITHER THE MOMENTUM OR ENERGY THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BUT BOTH TOGETHER

TAKE A BASEBALL AND BAT FOR INSTANCE WITHOUT PUTTING ENERGY IN IF YOU'RE BUNTING THE BALL GOES BACK TOWARDS THE PITCHER AND THE BAT GOES BACKWARDS NOW WITHOUT PUTTING ENERGY IN IF YOU'RE HITTING A BALL FROM A TEE YOU BASICALLY DROP THE BAT AND NEITHER THE BAT NOR BALL MOVE NOW LET'S ADD ENERGY TO THE SYSTEM FROM THE BATTER HE SWINGS AND HITS IF HE HITS IT FROM THE TEE IT GOES ONLY SO FAR IF HE HITS A PITCHED BALL NOT ONLY DOES THE BALL A GO BACK FROM JUST HITTING THE BAT LIKE THE BUNT IT ALSO GETS B ENERGY FROM THE BATTER EQUAL TO THAT BEING HIT FROM THE TEE AND C EVEN MORE EXTRA ENERGY FROM THE BATTER DUE TO THE DEFORMATION OF THE BALL AND BAT ALLOWING THE SAME FORCE TO BE APPLIED OVER A LONGER TIME THAN HIT FROM THE TEE

WHILE THIS ANALOGY MIGHT NOT HOLD FOR HOCKEY PUCK AND STICK IN MY IMAGINATION THE PUCK MIGHT OVERTAKE THE STICK AND THEY BOTH GO BACKWARDS IN THE BUNTING CASE I DO BELIEVE THE REST OF IT HOLDS

AS FOR THE SPECIFIC ARGUMENT I CAN SAY THAT A PUCK WILL GENERALLY BE FASTER THAN ONE HIT FROM REST ASSUMING YOU HIT BOTH WITH THE SAME STRENGTH THIS ISN'T FOR THE CASE WHEN A PUCK IS AT SPEEDS THAT YOUR STRENGTH CAN'T OVERCOME AND AS FOR THE THING YOU'D NEED THOSE ACTUAL NUMBERS AND ACTUAL EQUATIONS WHICH I DOUBT YOU'LL GET HERE TODAY
WHILE THE TRUE ANSWER HAS ENDLESS COMPLICATIONS AT ESSENCE BOTH SHOTS ARE ELASTIC COLLISIONS MOSTLY FOR SHOTS OF EQUAL STRENGTH THE REBOUND WILL BE FASTER IF THERE'S ALREADY ENERGY GOING INTO IT SO THE ONE TIMER WINS

DON'T TRY AND ADD ACTUAL NUMBERS TO YOUR ANSWER THOUGH

PHYSICIST WHO'S PLAYED FIVE HOCKEY GAMES IN THE LAST HRS
THE ANSWER IS THAT YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT OR WRONG BUT YOUR EXPLANATION
YOU'RE REDIRECTING THAT MOMENTUM SO YOU DON'T NEED TO ADD AS MUCH OF YOUR OWN POWER

IS DEFINITELY INSUFFICIENT TO JUSTIFY YOUR CLAIM

FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS DISCUSSION WE CAN IMAGINE THE HOCKEY PUCK AS BEING JUST A CIRCLE MOVING IN 2 DIMENSIONS LET'S SET UP OUR COORDINATE SYSTEM SO THAT WE CAN EASILY REFER TO THE TWO DIRECTIONS ONE AXIS WILL BE ALONG THE LINE CONNECTING THE POINT OF THE SHOT AND THE CENTER OF THE GOAL PARALLEL AXIS THE OTHER AXIS WILL BE PERPENDICULAR TO THE FIRST PERPENDICULAR AXIS

RECALL THAT THE ORTHOGONAL COMPONENTS OF THE MOMENTUM VECTOR ARE INDEPENDENT THE MOMENTUM IN THE DIRECTION YOU WANT TO SHOOT IS TOTALLY UNRELATED TO THE MOMENTUM IN THE DIRECTION PERPENDICULAR TO WHERE YOU WANT TO SHOOT EACH COMPONENT IS ONLY AFFECTED BY THE FORCE IN THAT DIRECTION SO IF YOU WANT TO TAKE A STATIONARY PUCK AND ACCELERATE IT UNTIL IT'S MOMENTUM IS P THAT REQUIRES A TOTAL CHANGE IN MOMENTUM OF P YOU END AT P YOU START AT HOWEVER IF YOU WANT TO REDIRECT THE MOMENTUM FROM PURELY PERPENDICULAR TO PURELY PARALLEL WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS APPLY A FORCE THAT SLOWS THE PUCK IN THE PERPENDICULAR DIRECTION AND SPEEDS IT UP IN THE PARALLEL ONE IF YOU CALCULATE THE TOTAL CHANGE IN MOMENTUM FROM P IN THE PURELY PERPENDICULAR DIRECTION TO P IN THE PURELY PARALLEL YOU'LL FIND THAT IT'S MAGNITUDE IS SQRT 2 I EAST IT'S BIGGER THAN PAGE THAT MEANS THAT FOR A GIVEN AMOUNT OF TIME T IT TAKES A BIGGER FORCE TO REDIRECT THE MOMENTUM OF AN OBJECT FROM PERPENDICULAR TO PARALLEL THAN IT DOES TO START AN OBJECT FROM REST AND GET IT GOING UP TO THE SAME SPEED

ON THE OTHER HAND IF ALL YOU WANT TO DO IS ROTATE THE MOMENTUM A LITTLE BIT FROM TO PURELY PARALLEL THEN YOU CAN DO A SLIGHTLY MORE COMPLICATED CALCULATION TO SHOW THAT TAKES LESS CHANGE IN MOMENTUM THAN STARTING THE PUCK FROM REST YOU CAN MAYBE WORK OUT THAT THE BREAK-EVEN POINT IS A ROTATION OF DEGREES SO YOUR EXPLANATION DOESN'T REALLY WORK IN GENERAL SOMETIMES IT'S EASIER TO REDIRECT MOMENTUM WITH A GIVEN STRENGTH OF FORCE SOMETIMES IT'S HARDER

HOWEVER YOU MIGHT STILL BE RIGHT THAT IT IS EASIER TO REDIRECT THE MOMENTUM OF THE PUCK THAN IT IS TO START IT FROM DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT REQUIRES EITHER A LARGER FORCE OR MORE TIME FOR YOUR STICK TO BE IN CONTACT WITH THE PUCK IT'S JUST THAT YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHY IT'S EASIER THE FACT THAT YOU'RE REDIRECTING MOMENTUM ALONE ISN'T ENOUGH BECAUSE OUR VERY BASIC PICTURE SAYS REDIRECTING MOMENTUM TAKES MORE FORCE OR MORE TIME RATHER THAN LESS SOMETIMES AND IN THE VIDEO YOU LINKED THE SHOOTER IS CHANGING THE DIRECTION OF THE PUCK FROM ALMOST PURELY PERPENDICULAR TO ALMOST PURELY PARALLEL

AT THIS POINT THINGS GET REALLY TRICKY AND TO FIND THE RIGHT ANSWER YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING MUCH MORE DETAILED THERE'S REALLY NO GOOD REASON TO ASSUME THAT THE FORCE FOR A STATIONARY AND A ARE THE SAME THE COULD BE JUST VERY DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOU'RE OFTEN IN MOTION DURING A AND OFTEN NOT FOR A FROM REST ETC THERE'S EVEN LESS GOOD REASON TO ASSUME THAT THE TIME THE BLADE IS IN CONTACT WITH THE PUCK IS THE SAME THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE ARE MANY EFFECTS REDIRECTING MOMENTUM CAN BE HARDER A MOVING PUCK EXERTS MORE FORCE ON THE STICK CAUSING IT TO BEND MORE A PLAYER INCREASES THE SPEED OF HIS STICK WHEN HE STARTS MOVING FORWARD BEFORE THE SHOT ETC AND THERE'S NO PRINCIPLED WAY TO SAY WHICH ONE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT GENERALLY

TO GET A HANDLE ON THIS YOU REALLY NEED A PLAUSIBLE MATHEMATICAL MODEL AND TO DO SOME REAL CALCULATIONS YOU COULD START WITH SOMETHING VERY SIMPLE LIKE ASSUMING THAT THE PLAYER IS ALWAYS STATIONARY THAT BOTH THE PUCK AND STICK ARE RIGID OBJECTS AND THAT THE PLAYER ALWAYS EXERTS A CONSTANT FORCE ON THE STICK THEN YOU MAKE THINGS MORE COMPLICATED FROM THERE IT'D BE PRETTY EASY TO RELAX THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT THE PLAYER IS STATIONARY THEN YOU MIGHT KEEP THE PUCK RIGID BUT MODEL THE STICK AS A LINEAR ELASTIC MEDIUM ETC AND HOPEFULLY WHAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FIND ARE RANGES OF PARAMETER VALUES WHERE A IS FASTER SLOWER THAN A SIMILAR FROM REST AND YOU CAN GIVE A CONVINCING ARGUMENT ABOUT WHY THAT'S HAPPENING
FROM MY OWN UNDERSTANDING YOU'D BE CORRECT SOME OF THE KINETIC ENERGY WOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO THE STICK AS POTENTIAL MAKING IT BEND BACK A LITTLE MORE THAN IT IS ALREADY THEN WHEN THE STICK IS LIFTED TO THE VERTICAL POSITION IT RELEASES THE POTENTIAL AND SNAPS FORWARD IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE PROPERTIES OF THE STICK AND PUCK AND THE PERCENTAGE OF ENERGY TRANSFERRED BUT WITH MODERN EQUIPMENT I'M VERY SURE THAT LESS INPUT FROM THE SHOOTER REDIRECTING A MOVING PUCK WOULD BE MORE POWERFUL OVERALL COMPARED TO A SHOT WITH MORE INPUT FROM THE SHOOTER BUT ON A STATIONARY PUCK
IT'S LIKE KICKING A FOOTBALL SOCCER BALL THAT'S MOVING ACROSS YOUR FOV YOU CAN FEEL THAT IT GETS MORE POWER WHEN IT'S MOVING COMPARED WITH BEING STATIONARY
TL R YOU'RE PROBABLY CORRECT
IT DEPENDS ON HOW BENDY YOUR STICK IS

IF YOU HAVE A RIGID STICK WITH ABSOLUTELY NO BEND THEN IT IS EASIER TO HIT A PASS THAT IS COMING AT YOU SLOWLY THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS REDIRECTING MOMENTUM MOMENTUM BY DEFINITION HAS A SET MOMENTUM AND YOU NEED TO FIRST HIT IT HARD ENOUGH TO STOP THAT EXISTING MOMENTUM AND ADD TO THE PUCK YOUR OWN MOMENTUM FROM THE STICK

SITUATION 2 YOU HAVE A SOMEWHAT BENDY HOCKED STICK THEN AS THE PUCK COMES IN IT BENDS THE STICK BACKWARDS WHICH QUICKLY BENDS BACK FORWARD TO GIVE THE PUCK A LITTLE MORE FLICK AS YOU SLAPSHOT IT THUS WITH A SLIGHTLY BENDY HOCKEY STICK YOU WILL HIT A FAST INCOMING PUCK HARDER THAN A SLOW PASSIVE
UNFORTUNATELY THEY DIDN'T REALLY SETTLE ANYTHING BECAUSE ALL OF US HERE ALREADY BELIEVED THAT NATURE VIOLATES THE BELL INEQUALITIES OR THE CASH INEQUALITIES WHATEVER YOU PREFER AND ANYONE ON THE OTHER SIDE COOKING UP SOME MORE AND MORE CONVOLUTED THEORY AS TO WHY THE INEQUALITIES APPEAR TO BE VIOLATED WHILE THE UNIVERSE IS ACTUALLY GOVERNED BY SOME LOCAL HIDDEN VARIABLES CAN JUST INTRODUCE SOME SLIGHTLY MORE COMPLICATED THING TO EXPLAIN THIS RESULT
IF YOU MEASURE THE ROTATION OF ONE PARTICLE YOU WILL INSTANTLY KNOW THE SPIN OF ITS ENTANGLED PARTICLE PHYSICISTS HAVE CONSIDERED THIS BEHAVIOR AS SPOOKY AS IT DOESN T FOLLOW OUR DAILY LOGIC AT ALL

WELL STRICTLY SPEAKING IF TWO PARTICLES WERE PREPARED IN A NET STATE AND YOU MEASURE THE PROJECTION OF ONE PARTICLE'S SPIN ALONG A GIVEN AXIS YOU KNOW THE OTHER PARTICLE'S SPIN IS OPPOSITE ALONG THAT SAME AXIS HOWEVER YOU CAN ONLY PREDICT PROBABILITIES FOR THE SPIN ALONG ANY OTHER AXIS

AND THIS BY ITSELF DOESN'T VIOLATE OUR COMMON SENSE IN FACT IT'S JUST CONSERVATION OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM THE NET ANGULAR MOMENTUM ALONG ANY AXIS MUST BE ZERO FOR AN ANALOGY IF YOU PUT A RED BALL AND A GREEN BALL IN TWO SEPARATE BOXES AND MOVED THEM FAR APART YOU'LL KNOW THE COLOR OF THE BALL IN THE OTHER BOX INSTANTLY WHEN YOU OPEN ONE BOX THERE'S NOTHING SPOOKY OR MYSTERIOUS ABOUT THIS

WHAT MAKES THE QUANTUM MECHANICAL SCENARIO DIFFERENT IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU MEASURE THE PROJECTION OF SPIN ALONG DIFFERENT AXES FOR EACH ENTANGLED PARTNER THERE ARE STRICT BOUNDS ON HOW STRONGLY UP AND DOWN MEASUREMENTS ALONG DIFFERENT AXES CAN BE CORRELATED IF YOU ASSUME WHAT'S CALLED LOCAL REALISM WHICH BASICALLY AMOUNTS TO SAYING THAT THE SPIN MEASUREMENTS REVEAL PROPERTIES WHOSE VALUES ARE FIXED WHEN THE TWO PARTICLES ARE CREATED THIS PAPER BY J SOUTH BELL GIVES A VERY CLEAR EXPLANATION OF LOCAL REALISM WITH REASONING AND EXAMPLES

QUANTUM MECHANICS VIOLATES THESE BOUNDS AND EXPERIMENTS CONFIRM PREDICTIONS IN THESE CASES THIS MEANS THAT LOCAL REALISM IS WRONG PERHAPS THAT'S SPOOKY TO SOME PEOPLE BUT I THINK THAT'S A SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENT A LOT OF PEOPLE FOUND FORCE OF GRAVITY WHICH ACTED AT A DISTANCE WITHOUT A MEDIUM TO BE OCCULT AND SPOOKY IN HIS TIME BUT NO-ONE I KNOW TODAY WOULD BAT AN EYE AT THE IDEA AND SOME ANCIENT GREEKS FOUND THE IDEA OF IRRATIONAL NUMBERS VISCERALLY UNSETTLING BUT THEIR EXISTENCE IS SOMETHING MOST PEOPLE TODAY SHRUG OFF WITHOUT A CARE I THINK PEOPLE JUST NEED TO GET USED TO THE IN QUANTUM MECHANICS

QUANTUM MECHANICS ALSO STATES THAT PROPERTIES OF PARTICLES ARE ONLY STABLE WHEN THE PARTICLE IS PERCEIVED

THIS ISN'T TRUE PERCEPTION IS A PSYCHOLOGICAL PHENOMENON THAT DOES NOT APPEAR ANYWHERE IN THE FORMULATION OR APPLICATION OF QUANTUM MECHANICS

UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE THEORISTS HERE THE WATER BOTTLE FLIPPING TRICK RELIES ON THE MOTION OF THE WATER IN THE BOTTLE WHICH TAKES UP THE ANGULAR MOMENTUM OF THE BOTTLE THAT MEANS YOU NEED TO SOLVE EQUATIONS FOR A TURBULENT LIQUID IN A FREE-FALLING CONTAINER SOMETHING THAT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO DO ANALYTICALLY

IF YOU WANT TO DO HIGH-SCHOOL LEVEL RESEARCH ON THIS I WOULD GO THE PURELY EXPERIMENTAL ROUTE
I THINK A BIT OF IT IS JUST KEEPING THE CENTER OF MASS OVER THE BASE OF THE BOTTLE THE WATER HELPS DO THIS IN ORDER TO TIP OVER THEN THE CENTER OF MASS JUST NEEDS TO BE SOMEWHERE NOT ABOVE THE FLAT BASE SO FILLING IT UP TOO HIGH WOULD MAKE IT MORE LIKELY TO TIP SINCE THE COM IS AT A HIGHER POINT SO THE TIPPING ANGLE WOULD BE LARGER

EDIT SO I'M ON MOBILE SO THIS IS KIND OF HARD BUT I'M STICKING WITH THAT CENTER OF MASS EXPLANATION I DON'T THINK TORQUE WOULD REALLY COME INTO PLAY IF YOU JUST LOOK AT CM THE VOLUME OF WATER THE DIMENSIONS OF THE BOTTLE AND THE LANDING ANGLE WOULD BE WHAT ARE IMPORTANT HERE ALSO THE DENSITY OF THE BOTTLE AND WHATEVER LIQUID YOU PUT IN WOULD BE NEEDED FOR CM

IF YOU WANTED TO USE TORQUE THEN YOU'D NEED TO USE THE CM AS A PIVOT POINT NOT TOO SURE TO BE HONEST MIGHT USE THE PART OF THE BOTTLE TOUCHING THE TABLE THE YOU'D NEED AN INTEGRAL TO CALCULATE THE TORQUE ON BOTH SIDES FROM THE GRAVITY WORKING ON THE WATER AND THE PLASTIC BOTTLE YOU'D ALSO STILL NEED A LANDING ANGLE SINCE YOU'D NEED THAT TO CALCULATE THE CROSS PRODUCT FOR THE TORQUE
I THINK THERE'S NOT ONE EQUATION FOR THAT I DON'T THINK WE CAN TREAT THIS LIKE A SIMPLE HIGH-SCHOOL MOTION CLASS BECAUSE THE WATER INSIDE THE BOTTLE HAS ITS OWN PROPERTIES AND INERTIA IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT A SMALL CHANGE IN THE SWING OF THE BOTTLE CAN MEAN IT EITHER GETS BALANCED OR DOESN'T
BUT NICE QUESTION THO WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT ANSWERED
BINARY IS SIMPLY AN AGREED UPON SET OF RULES FOR INTERPRETING A SEQUENCE OF ON AND OFF STATES THESE ON AND OFF STATES CAN TAKE ANY PHYSICAL FORM IT CAN BE SERIES OF HOLE PUNCHES IN CARDS A SERIES OF MAGNETIZED STATES A SERIES OF FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTORS OR EVEN A SERIES OF MINECRAFT BLOCKS SO WHAT YOUR S AND S ARE MADE OF DEPENDS UPON WHAT KIND OF DEVICE YOU ARE USING

A DIGITAL DEVICE IS ANY DEVICE WHICH STORES AND READS DATA THAT TAKES A BINARY FORM SO A DIGITAL DEVICE DOES NOT STORE THE LETTER A IT STORES THE BINARY SEQUENCE EVEN MECHANICAL COMPUTERS WHICH STORE DATA IN BINARY FORM ARE CONSIDERED TO BE DIGITAL DEVICES EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE NO ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS

IN SHORT THE TERMS DIGITAL AND PHYSICAL ARE NOT OPPOSITE TERMS SINCE DIGITAL DEVICES EXIST IN THE REAL WORLD THEY ARE OF COURSE ALSO PHYSICAL DEVICES


WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IS INFORMATION THEORY HAVE A LOOK AT CLAUDE STUFF GET YOUR HEAD AROUND ENTROPY AND COMPLEXITY INFO IS THE ARRANGEMENT AND RELATIONSHIPS OF STUFF NOT THE STUFF ITSELF IN THE SAME WAY THAT A STORY IS NOT MADE OF INK BITS OF INFO ARE NOT MADE OF CHARGE OR VOLTAGE BUT A COMPLEX ARRANGEMENT OF CHARGES CAN CONTAIN INFO AS CAN A SHEET OF PUNCHED HOLES OR A BATH FULL OF WATER MOLECULES

I'D TRY THE COMPESCE GUYS FIRST THEN START ON HOW IT ALL APPLIES TO THERMODYNAMICS
THIS SHOULD BE HELPFUL

I DON'T THINK BINARY DIGITAL INFORMATION SHOULD HAVE ANY SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE DON'T GET HUNG UP ON BINARY OR THAT'S JUST A CONVENIENT CHOICE OF BASIS FOR DESIGNING COMPUTERS

THE FOLLOWING FEELS A BIT BUT IT'S SOMETHING A BIT ON MY MIND LATELY SO WHATEVER IT'S INTERESTING TO ASK IS REALITY MADE UP OF INFORMATION THIS IS NOT A PARTICULARLY NEW IDEA THERE IS THE OLD SLOGAN ABOUT IT FROM BIT AND SO ON AND IT SORT OF MAKES SENSE TO ME ALL OUR PHYSICS THEORIES ARE MATHEMATICAL AND IT'S VERY HARD FOR ME TO IMAGINE PHYSICS EVER MOVING AWAY FROM MATHEMATICAL MODELS SO WHATEVER THE FUNDAMENTAL DESCRIPTION OF REALITY IS IT'LL PROBABLY BE SOME MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURE THEN IF WE BELIEVE THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL THEORY IS SOME MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURE OR MODEL THEN WHAT IS THE PHYSICAL WORLD WE OBSERVE IT'S NOTHING BUT A PARTICULAR SOLUTION TO THIS MODEL AND ME WHO IS WRITING THIS IS NOTHING BUT A TINY PART OF THIS SOLUTION A MATHEMATICAL SUBSTRUCTURE THINKING ABOUT MYSELF THINKING ABOUT THE MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURE THIS IS ESSENTIALLY TELEMARKS MATHEMATICAL UNIVERSE HYPOTHESIS AND IT NATURALLY LEADS TO PRETTY EXTREME IDEAS AND SO ON ANYHOW IF ANYONE READ ALL THIS THEN I'M SORRY FOR THE RAMBLING MESS
I HAVE A COPYRIGHT LAW EXAMPLE TO FURTHER MY QUESTION

THERE WAS A CASE CALLED COUNTY MASCULINE PAULA CO VERB LOGAN IN THIS CASE LOGAN PURCHASED A GREETING CARD WITH AN IMAGE ON IT LOGAN THEN USED CHEMICALS TO REMOVE THIS IMAGE AND TRANSFER IT TO A PLAQUE LOGAN THEN RESOLD THE PLAQUE

LOGAN WAS LATER SUED BY THE GREETING CARD COMPANY FOR INFRINGEMENT OF THEIR COPYRIGHTED IMAGE COUNTY M PAULA CO ARGUED THE PLAQUE WAS AN ILLEGAL REPRODUCTION HOWEVER THE COURT SIDED WITH LOGAN NOTING THAT FOR EVERY PLAQUE LOGAN MADE LOGAN HAD TO PURCHASE A CORRESPONDING GREETING CARD

IN THIS EXAMPLE
THE GREETING CARD ITS THE INITIAL STORAGE MEDIUM
2 THE IMAGE IS THE INFORMATION INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
THE PLAQUE IS THE NEW STORAGE MEDIUM

THIS SEEMS ANALOGOUS TO AN STORED ON A HARD DRIVE LETS SUPPOSE THAT AN CAN BE TRANSFERRED FROM ONE HARD DRIVE TO A DIFFERENT HARD DRIVE BIT BY BIT MEANING NO COPYING EXISTS OCCURS

IN THIS EXAMPLE
THE HARD DRIVE A IS THE INITIAL STORAGE MEDIUM
2 THE IS THE INFORMATION INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
THE DIFFERENT HARD DRIVE B IS THE NEW STORAGE MEDIUM

IN THIS CASE COULD SOMEONE REASONABLY ARGUE THAT SIMILARLY TO THE INK OF THE IMAGE TRANSFERRED TO THE PLAQUE THAT THE INFORMATION REPRESENTING AN IS PHYSICAL AGAIN SIMILAR TO THE PHYSICALITY OF INK AND THAT HARD DRIVES ARE SIMPLY STORAGE MEDIUMS
I ALSO POSTED THIS SAME POST IN R COMPESCE AND R QUANTUM

LOTS OF CONVERSATION IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN SEEING THEIR THOUGHTS TOO

IS BINARY MADE UP OF ATOMS

THIS IS MORE OF A PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION THAN A QUESTION ABOUT PHYSICS A SERIES OF BINARY BITS CAN TAKE MANY FORMS ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES IN SPACE MAGNETIC DOMAINS ON A RECORDING MEDIUM ELECTRON WELLS IN A SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE BUT YOU APPEAR TO BE ASKING ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF BINARY BITS NOT THEIR PHYSICAL EMBODIMENT EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE ASKING AS THOUGH YOU WANT TO PIN DOWN THE LATTER

A COLLECTION OF BINARY BITS CAN POSSESS ENTROPY AMONG OTHER PROPERTIES AND THIS CAN BE SPECIFIED AND MEASURED BUT THAT FACT HAS NO CONNECTION WITH THE PHYSICAL REPRESENTATION OF THE BITS A INFORMATION PROPERTIES ARE INDEPENDENT OF ITS PHYSICAL REPRESENTATION THEREFORE WHEN YOU ASK A QUESTION LIKE THIS YOU NEED TO ASK CAREFULLY TO AVOID CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT'S BEING ASKED

I AM PLEASED TO SAY THAT IN THE CASE OF MY QUANTUM BOOK I HAVE EXTRACTED MYSELF FROM PEARSON SWITCHING TO CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PRESS AND THE IDENTICAL BOOK NOW SELLS FOR LESS THAN HALF WHAT PEARSON WAS CHARGING

NOW HE TELLS ME
DURING SPRING BREAK OF I WENT TO VISIT MY GIRLFRIEND AT REED COLLEGE SINCE I WAS A HUGE NERD I BROUGHT ALONG MY COPY OF GRIFFITHS E M TEXTBOOK WITH THE INTENTION OF HAVING HIM SIGN IT I LOOKED HIM UP IN THE DIRECTORY AND FOUND HIS OFFICE KNOCKED ON THE DOOR AND THERE HE WAS

I STAMMERED OUT SOME DUMB JOKE ABOUT HOW HIS PROBLEM SETS WERE TOO HARD AND HE VERY GRACIOUSLY ACCEPTED MY REQUEST TO SIGN THE BOOK I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO CHAT FOR A BIT BUT SINCE I HAD OBVIOUSLY INTERRUPTED HIS WORK I THOUGHT IT BEST TO JUST LET HIM BE MY CAREER PATH EVENTUALLY VEERED AWAY FROM PHYSICS BUT I'LL ALWAYS APPRECIATE HIS WILLINGNESS TO HUMOR A STUPID JUNIOR FROM ANOTHER SCHOOL WHO WAS JUST TO BE IN THE SAME ROOM AS HIM

WHEN CLASSES STARTED AGAIN HALF MY FRIENDS THOUGHT THAT MY SIGNED COPY WAS AWESOME AND THE OTHER HALF COULDN'T BELIEVE I HAD WASTED MY BREAK ON SOMETHING THIS STUPID
I ONLY USED HIS E M BOOK DURING MY UNDERGRAD AND IT'S A FANTASTIC BOOK GREAT INTERVIEW
I COULD NEVER WRITE A BOOK FROM SCRATCH WITHOUT THIS INCREMENTAL SEQUENCE OF SUCCESSIVE APPROXIMATIONS

OH BOY I DIDN'T KNOW GRIFFITHS WAS A COMEDIAN TOO
I WILL LEAVE MY ANSWERS UP TO THE INTERVIEWER TO DETERMINE AS AN EXERCISE
I LOVE HIS QM AND E M BOOKS THEY'RE JUST FANTASTICALLY DESIGNED AND WRITTEN
I JUST WISH SOMEONE LIKE HIM OR TAYLOR WOULD WRITE A GOOD UNDERGRADUATE STAT MECH BOOK I DID NOT ENJOY KITTEL
HIS INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRODYNAMICS IS SUPERB
I HAVE HIS INTRODUCTION TO QUANTUM MECHANICS SITTING HERE ON MY SHELF AT WORK IT'S SUCH A EASY TEXT TO READ MADE QM MUCH MORE UNDERSTANDABLE FOR ME


WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE TO A LAYPERSON WHO IS INTERESTED IN QM BUT LACKS THE MATH BACKGROUND TO TAKE ON A SERIOUS UNDERGRADUATE COURSE

LEARN THE MATHEMATICS YOU LL BE GLAD YOU DID WHETHER YOU TAKE THE QM COURSE OR NOT

PEOPLE SAY THIS A LOT ON HERE BUT IT'S NICE TO SEE REPEATED BY SOMEONE CREDIBLE PERHAPS PEOPLE MIGHT BELIEVE IT THIS TIME
BOOK REVOLUTIONS IN CENTURY PHYSICS IS ALSO GREAT

I HOPE HE WRITES ANOTHER BOOK ON ANOTHER TOPIC
HIS INTRO TO ELEMENTARY PARTICLES IS ONE OF THE BEST
I'M SORRY BUT I HATE HIS BOOKS ESPECIALLY HIS INTRODUCTION TO QUANTUM MECHANICS WITH SUPER PASSIONATE FIERY HATRED FOR THE CHAPTERS ON SPIN AND LADDER OPERATORS IT'S COMPLETELY SYMPTOMATIC OF HIS ENTIRE APPROACH THAT THESE CHAPTERS HAVE NEITHER SUFFICIENT PHYSICAL MOTIVATION NOR MATHEMATICAL RIGOR

HIS ELECTRODYNAMICS IS MUCH BETTER EVEN EXCELLENT BUT I WOULD PREFER IF COLLEGES DUMPED HIM FOR WAGONESS AS THE STANDARD BOOK FOR ELECTRODYNAMICS I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY KEEP HIS BOOKS THOUGH AS HE OFTEN HAS A HAND IN CREATING THE PHYSICS GRE SUBJECT TEST AND THEREFORE HAS A STRANGLEHOLD ON PHYSICS EDUCATION NATIONWIDE
I HAVE A STRONG DISLIKE FOR GRIFFITHS AND THE REST OF THE TEXTBOOK AUTHORS OF HIS GENERATION FOR DUMBING DOWN THE AMERICAN UNDERGRADUATE CURRICULUM OVER IN BELGIUM AND FRANCE IN THEIR 2ND YEAR OF UNIVERSITY THEY DO CM AT THE LEVEL OF GOLDSTEIN LANDAU AND EM AT THE LEVEL OF JACKSON QM AT THE LEVEL OF SAKURAI WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE THE REASON FOR SUCH IMMENSE DISCREPANCY
TAYLOR IS A TRULY ASTOUNDING BOOK IT'S EASY TO READ THE FIRST TIME THROUGH AND RIGOROUS ENOUGH FOR A COMPLETE UNDERGRADUATE UNDERSTANDING
HIS QUANTUM BOOK IS GARBAGE EM IS GOOD THO TAUGHT MYSELF UNDERGRAD AND FROM IT

AS SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T KNOW ALL THAT MUCH ABOUT CARS AND YOU CAN SAFELY ASSUME THAT'S MOST OF US CAN YOU CLARIFY ARE THESE SHOCKS ARE THESE ATTACHED TO THE HOOD AS ROLL BAR SPRINGS ARE THERE SPRINGS ON THE DRIVESHAFT TO KEEP IT FROM REACTING TOO QUICKLY I MEAN EXPLAIN THE PURPOSE OF THESE WHAT'S THEIR ROLE IN THE CAR WHAT DO THEY DO ARE THE FORCE RATINGS TORSIONAL OR LONGITUDINAL IF IT APPLIES ARE THEY UNDER PRESSURE WHEN THEY'RE INSTALLED WHAT'S THE COIL THICKNESS AND DISTANCE BETWEEN COILS TO SEE IF IT'S DEFORMED ETC

YOU PICKED THE PERFECT PLACE TO ASK A COMPLEX SPRING QUESTION I ASSUME R ASKPHYSICS WOULDN'T BUT JUST LIKE YOU CAN'T ASK A DIVING QUESTION TO A PERSON IN THE DESERT YOU CAN'T ASK A CAR QUESTION HERE WITHOUT EXPLAINING ALL THE ACCOMPANYING VARIABLES
SPRINGS ARE PRETTY SIMPLE PHYSICAL OBJECTS THEY APPLY A FORCE DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE DISPLACEMENT FROM NATURAL LENGTH IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF THE FORCE APPLIED THIS CAN BE REPRESENTED BY F K X WHERE K IS THE SPRING CONSTANT THAT DESCRIBES HOW STIFF THE SPRING IS IN THIS CASE YOU HAVE 2 SPRINGS OF DIFFERING LENGTH SO THE DISPLACEMENTS WILL BE INTRINSICALLY DIFFERENT THERE WILL BE EXACTLY ONE POINT WHERE THE SPRINGS WILL EXERT THE SAME FORCE ON THE MOUNTS BUT OTHER THAN THAT THEIR PERFORMANCE WILL BE DIFFERENT

I'M FAIRLY CERTAIN THE LBS RATING FOR THE SPRINGS ARE RELATED TO THE SPRING CONSTANT BUT THE SPRING CONSTANT IS IN TERMS OF FORCE PER LENGTH NOT JUST FORCE I ASSUME THERE'S PROBABLY A STANDARD DISPLACEMENT TO MEASURE A FORCE RESPONSE IN THAT CASE

I'M NOT CERTAIN EXACTLY THE CONFIGURATION OF THE SPRINGS SO IT'S HARD TO SAY ANYTHING FURTHER ARE THE SPRINGS ALREADY COMPRESSED WHEN INSTALLED TO MAINTAIN A PRESSURE AGAINST THE MOUNT ARE THE MOUNTS VARIABLE IN LENGTH TO ACCOUNT FOR DIFFERENT LENGTH SPRINGS
STAINLESS STEEL IS A PRETTY POOR CONDUCTOR COMPARED TO ALUMINIUM AND WILL NOT BE AS EFFECTIVE AS A HEAT SINK WHETHER OR NOT IT IS SUFFICIENTLY GOOD FOR THE JOB IN THIS CASE IS NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE TRIVIALLY ANSWERED WITHOUT SPECS OR TESTING
I WAS UNDER THE STRONG IMPRESSION BY MY BOSS THAT METAL SIC WILL HEAT THE LED CIRCUITER ALOT FASTER COMPARE TO ALUMINUM AND WILL AFFECT THE LIFE LENGTH OF THE LED STRIP

WHEN YOU SAY METAL IN THE ABOVE SENTENCE DO YOU MEAN STAINLESS STEEL

THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS THAT MUCH DEPENDS ON HOW THE LEDS ARE MOUNTED AND WHAT STEPS ARE TAKEN TO MAXIMIZE THE THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY BETWEEN THE LEDS AND THE METAL BAR

BUT ACCORDING TO THIS REFERENCE THE THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY OF ALUMINUM IS W M K COMPARED TO STAINLESS STEEL AT W M K BOTH VALUES AT SO ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL ALUMINUM IS A MUCH BETTER HEAT CONDUCTOR AND IS PREFERRED WHERE HEAT DISSIPATION IS A FACTOR
INFRARED SPECTROSCOPIST HERE

THE CRUDE MODEL IS PRETTY MUCH THE FOUNDATION OF EVERYTHING WE DO IN MY FIELD ALTHOUGH THE ASSUMPTIONS OF HIS MODEL ARE TECHNICALLY INCORRECT THE FORM OF METALLIC OPTICAL CONDUCTIVITY DERIVED BY CRUDE IS CORRECT AND VERY WIDELY USED TO MODEL REFLECTION AND TRANSMISSION EXPERIMENTS IN THE FAR INFRARED MOREOVER THE CONCEPT OF SPECTRAL WEIGHT OR CRUDE WEIGHT IS EXTREMELY POWERFUL FOR ANALYZING SPECTROSCOPIC MEASUREMENTS

SO IF YOU'RE INTO SPECTROSCOPY YES LEARN THE CRUDE MODEL
ARE YOU TAKING A COURSE LEARN BOTH WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL BE ON THE EXAMINATION

PEDAGOGICALLY THE PURPOSES OF LEARNING THESE EARLIER THEORIES IS TO GUIDE YOUR UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHY THE LATER MORE CORRECT ONES WERE DEVELOPED AND ALSO BECAUSE THEY ARE ALSO OFTEN MATHEMATICALLY EASIER TO WORK THROUGH AS TO IF ITS USEFUL FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW TO GO THROUGH THE MATHEMATICS IS UP TO YOU REALLY
EVEN IF IT MAINLY REGARDS SOLID STATE PHYSICS IT'S ALSO VERY IMPORTANT IN THE STUDY OF EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS IN DESERTIC REGIONS SOURCE
LOW ENERGY SPECTROSCOPY MAKES GREAT USE OF IT STILL IT'S HOW THEY MODEL ABSORPTION ON THE LOWER END VISIBLE UV REQUIRES BAND THEORY AND MORE COMPLICATED MODELS OF HOW LIGHT IS ABSORBED
SANDSTORM THEORY
HERE'S A DECENT BREAKDOWN OF ERATOSTHENES EXPERIMENT THE ONLY GUESSING INVOLVED WERE THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT THE LIGHT SOURCE SUN WAS REALLY FAR AWAY AND THAT THE ARCH WAS A PERFECT SPHERE

IN B COUNTY THE GREEK ASTRONOMER ERATOSTHENES MADE THE FIRST GOOD MEASUREMENT OF THE SIZE OF EARTH BY NOTING THE ANGLES OF SHADOWS IN TWO CITIES ON THE SUMMER SOLSTICE AND BY PERFORMING THE RIGHT CALCULATIONS USING HIS KNOWLEDGE OF GEOMETRY AND THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE CITIES ERATOSTHENES WAS ABLE TO MAKE A REMARKABLY ACCURATE CALCULATION OF THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF EARTH
YOU'LL LET A DIRTY ENGINEER IN THIS SUB THANKS FOR SHARING
HOW DO YOU GET G EXACT ENOUGH FOR YOUR LOCATION
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND ENOUGH YET ABOUT THE STRUCTURE AND ENGINEERING OF DEEP ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS TO APPLY THEM TO THEORIES IN PHYSICS WHEN WHAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN IS A NATURAL KIND OF HEURISTIC OR OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM LIKE PLAYING GO OR TUNING EXPERIMENTAL PARAMETERS THEN IT'S VERY NATURAL TO USE THESE KIND OF NEURAL NETWORKS AS A BLACK BOX WHAT YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT IS MAKING THE END RESULT BE AS GOOD AS POSSIBLE GIVEN A KNOWN AND LARGE COLLECTION OF DATA

WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT UNSOLVED PROBLEMS IN PHYSICS THOUGH WE'RE USUALLY NOT TALKING ABOUT GETTING VERY ACCURATE COMPUTATIONS GIVEN A CERTAIN EXPERIMENTAL SETUP WITH CERTAIN KNOWN PARAMETER VALUES WE BASICALLY ALWAYS HAVE A DUMB WAY OF DOING CALCULATIONS TO TURN THE CRANK AND GET SOME KIND OF NUMERICAL ANSWER IF WE WANT IT PROBLEMS IN PHYSICS ARE ACTUALLY UNSOLVED FOR 2 REASONS EITHER WE LACK A HIGH-LEVEL UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEM THAT EXPLAINS WHY THE SYSTEM DOES WHAT IT DOES DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE CAN CALCULATE PREDICT FOR PARTICULAR INSTANCES OR WE HAVEN'T EVEN FIGURED OUT YET HOW TO MATHEMATICALLY SPECIFY THE PROBLEM APPROPRIATELY

AND IN THESE CASES NEURAL NETWORKS MIGHT STILL BE USEFUL BECAUSE THEY CAN IDENTIFY PATTERNS IN DATA AND PARTICULAR CALCULATIONS THAT HUMANS CANT BUT TO CONVERT THAT INTO A BONA FIDE THEORY WE NEED SOME BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW NEURAL NETWORKS DO WHAT THEY DO I THINK THERE ARE 2 POINTS HERE FIRST NEURAL NETWORKS ARE GOOD AT FINDING SOLUTIONS BUT THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY OPTIMAL AND SECOND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DESCRIBE PRECISELY WHAT FEATURES THE VARIOUS LAYERS OF A DEEP NETWORK ARE ACTUALLY ENCODING

NEURAL NETWORKS ARE ACTUALLY MUCH OLDER THAN MANY PEOPLE REALIZE AND THERE'S ALREADY BEEN SOME DEEP MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS DRAWN BETWEEN THEM AND PHYSICS THE LOSS FUNCTION LANDSCAPE AND LONG-TIME DYNAMICS OF DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS ARE ACTUALLY VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE OF SPIN GLASSES THERE ARE MANY RIGOROUS RESULTS ABOUT SPIN GLASSES THEIR LOCAL AND GLOBAL MINIMA AND THEIR DYNAMICS THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING INVESTIGATED IN THE CONTEXT OF DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS SPIN GLASSES GIVE A PRETTY CONSISTENT PICTURE OF WHY IT IS THAT DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS ALWAYS SEEM TO FIND A REASONABLY OPTIMAL SOLUTION BUT PERHAPS CANNOT FIND A TRUE GLOBALLY OPTIMAL SOLUTION IN FINITE TIME
CONVOLUTION NETWORKS ARE DESIGNED FOR SOLVING 2 D PROBLEMS LIKE IMAGES VIDEO AND GO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE BEST TOOL FOR ALL TYPES OF PROBLEMS

AND YOU ARE RIGHT NEURAL NETWORKS ARE BLACK BOXES IT'S JUST A FANCY CURVE FITTING TOOL NOTHING MORE

I THINK THE PHYSICIST MATHEMATICIAN JOHN VON NEUMAN SAID IT BEST

WITH FOUR PARAMETERS I CAN FIT AN ELEPHANT AND WITH FIVE I CAN MAKE HIM WIGGLE HIS TRUNK
NS ARE NOTHING MORE THAN THINGS THAT FIT FUNCTIONS TO DATA THEY'RE JUST VERY POWERFUL FITTERS YOU DON'T FEED THEM PROBLEMS TO SOLVE YOU FEED THEM DATA POINTS TO FIT

AND CANS IN PARTICULAR ARE DESIGNED TO FIT IMAGE FILTERS SO THEY'RE NOT REALLY THE RIGHT CLASS TO LOOK AT FOR THIS

AND JUST TO COMMENT ON A FEW OTHER POINTS YOU MADE IN COMMENTS

PEOPLE ARE NOT BIG NEURAL NETWORKS DESPITE WHAT IS OFTEN CLAIMED THEY'RE PEOPLE AT THE VERY LEAST A FUNCTIONAL PHYSICIST HAS TO BE ABLE NOT ONLY TO RECOGNIZE PATTERNS AND GUESS PREDICTABLE ANSWERS BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY TO BE CREATIVE AND DESIGN NEW SOLUTIONS ADAPTED TO NEW UNSOLVED PROBLEMS NEURAL NETWORKS DEEP OR NOT ALONGSIDE THE ETERNAL DEBATE OVER WHETHER DEPTH IS ACTUALLY NECESSARY JUST DON'T DO THAT THEY ONLY LEARN HOW TO REACT BASED ON A DATASET OF SIMILAR SITUATION THEY'RE VERY GOOD AT PICKING UP THE THINGS THAT MATTER BY BEING TRAINED ON BIG DATASETS BUT THEY CANNOT INVENT NEW THINGS THAT MATTER

ANOTHER THING YOUR IDEA OF WHAT STRING THEORY OR PERHAPS THEORETICAL PHYSICS IS OR HOW IT WORKS IS REALLY WEIRD APART FROM THE FACT THAT CONTESTABILITY OF STRING THEORY DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE THEORETICAL PHYSICS IS NOT LIKE A BIG BOX FULL OF PHYSICISTS AT THEIR CHAIRS BEING FED THEORIES AND BEING WHIPPED INTO OUTPUTTING PREDICTIONS THE PHYSICISTS WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE WHIPPED CONTINUOUSLY ADD NEW IDEAS A FEW OF THEM THEORIES MOST OF THEM TECHNIQUES INSIGHTS NOVEL CALCULATIONS REPEATING KNOWN CALCULATIONS ON DIFFERENT MODELS MUTATIS MUTANDIS IS KIND OF THE MOST EASY PART AND STILL NS AS WE DEFINE THEM TODAY WOULD HAVE A VERY HARD TIME TRYING TO DO THAT

I DON'T EXCLUDE AI MIGHT BE ABLE ONE DAY MAYBE SOON TO DO THE JOB OF PHYSICIST BUT I PROFOUNDLY DOUBT YOU CAN DO IT WITH A N
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WORKING ON AUTOMATED THEOREM PROVING WITH DEEP LEARNING LIKE THIS GUY THIS IS THE CLOSEST THING I CAN THINK OF


FROM AN EXPERIMENTAL PERSPECTIVE NS ARE USED ALL THE TIME TO DEFINE SIGNAL REGIONS OR AREAS THAT MIGHT BE PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO NEW PHYSICS THERE IS A PAPER SOMEWHERE THAT CLAIMS DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS ARE BETTER AT FEATURE IDENTIFICATION THAN THEORETICIANS BUT I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S BEEN REPLICATED YET

IN AN EFT FRAMEWORK NS CAN HELP IMPROVE LIMITS ON BROAD CLASSES OF NEW PHYSICS

FROM A PURELY THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE I DON'T THINK IT MAKES MUCH SENSE TO ASK A COMPUTER TO FORMULATE AN ORIGINAL THEORY YOU WOULD HAVE TO PROGRAM IN SOME SORT OF IMMENSE KNOWLEDGE OF CURRENT RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS AS WELL AS ENCODE ALL OF THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA IN A COMPLETELY WAY I DON'T THINK IT MAKES SENSE

SAYING THAT MY HONEST OPINION IS THAT CERN IS A FEW YEARS BEHIND THE TIMES IN COMPESCE RIGHT NOW AND I EXPECT VERY GOOD GROWTH IN THIS AREA FROM WITHIN AND WITHOUT
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IN SIMULATING COMPLICATED QUANTUM SYSTEMS WITH LARGE NUMBERS OF PARTICLES IS THAT BECAUSE OF ENTANGLEMENT IT REQUIRES A VAST AMOUNT OF INFORMATION TO FULLY REPRESENT THE QUANTUM STATES OF SUCH SYSTEMS HOWEVER ONE OF THE MIRACLES OF PHYSICS IS THAT DESPITE THIS VAST CAPACITY FOR INFORMATION WE ARE OFTEN ABLE TO HAVE TRICKS OR METHODS TO COMPRESS IT INTO SOME FORM THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND AS CLASSICAL BEINGS EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T THINK SUCH COMPRESSION IS POSSIBLE IN GENERAL WERE ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT FOR CASES WHERE WE CAN GET LUCKY ANYWAY I HAVE SEEN A FEW DISCUSSIONS OF THIS IDEA OF USING DEEP LEARNING TO STORE INFORMATION ABOUT LARGE QUANTUM STATES IT SOUNDS PROMISING TO ME BUT USUALLY IN PHYSICS WE LIKE TO BE ABLE TO CALCULATE OR EVEN PROVE THINGS AND SO THE LACK OF A BETTER ANALYTICAL UNDERSTANDING OF NEURAL NETWORKS MEANS THAT THESE SIMULATIONS ARE ONLY HEURISTIC FOR NOW AND NOT LEADING TO NEW FUNDAMENTAL DESCRIPTIONS OF QUANTUM STATES YET
I AGREE THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING FIELD AND A TIME IN THE FIELD THAT'S LIKELY TO SEE A LOT OF GROWTH IN THE NEAR FUTURE

TO YOUR QUESTION THE SIMPLE ANSWER IS YES

THE LESS SIMPLE ANSWER IS NOT AT THE MOMENT WE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE COMPUTERS CAPABLE OF MODELING THE STANDARD MODEL QUANTUM MECHANICS OR SPECIAL RELATIVITY ACCURATELY AND IN REAL TIME THIS MEANS THAT ANY AI USING THE MODEL WE LOADED WOULD BE HINDERED AND MAY MAKE INCORRECT OBSERVATIONS DUE TO FAULTY MODELING

IN THE TWO SCENARIOS YOU CITED THE AI WON OUT BECAUSE IT WAS INTERACTING WITH THE REAL WORLD A GO PLAYER IN ONE INSTANCE AND THE LASERS IN THE SECOND THE REAL WORLD IS A MUCH MORE ACCURATE MODEL OF THE REAL WORLD THAN ANY SIMULATION WE LOAD INTO THE MACHINE COULD BE

IF YOU TAKE THIS A STEP FURTHER AND ASK WHY NOT JUST GIVE THE AI ACCESS TO THE REAL WORLD WE GET CLOSER TO A YES ANSWER BUT THE AI WOULD STILL BE LIMITED TO THE INPUTS AND TOOLS WE PROVIDE IT MEANING IT MAY NEED SOMETHING FOR THE SOLUTION THAT IT DOESN'T KNOW EXISTS

I BELIEVE IN A FEW YEARS ESPECIALLY IF QUANTUM COMPUTERS COME TO FRUITION AND GIVE US A MEANS OF ACCURATELY MODELING THE QUANTUM WORLD IN A COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT AI WILL BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF PROBLEM SOLVING

AS IT STANDS NOW GRAD SCHOOL COMES WITH A VERY HIGH FINANCIAL OPPORTUNITY COST AND THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE YOU'LL END UP WITH A JOB THAT YOU COULD HAVE HAD RIGHT AFTER YOUR UNDERGRAD REGARDLESS

IF A BLACK HOLE BENDS SPACE SUCH ALL DIRECTIONS WITHIN THE EVENT HORIZON LEAD TO THE CENTER HOW DOES THIS AFFECT PARTICLE STATES AND ENTROPY IF NO PARTICLES CAN TRAVEL THEN MUST ALL QUARKS OCCUPY THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE SPACE PERMITTED BY THE PAULI EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE IF SO THEN DOES THE INABILITY OF THE SINGULARITY TO EVOLVE INTO A DIFFERENT STATE MEAN THAT ALL CONTAINED QUARKS ARE IN THE LOWEST POSSIBLE ENERGY STATE
I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RESOLUTION TO DEMON

CONSIDER THE SIMPLIFIED VERSION OF THE DEMON WITH A SINGLE PARTICLE IN A SZILARD ENGINE WHICH IS JUST A BOX WHOSE WALLS ARE AT A FIXED TEMPERATURE TENSE IN ADDITION WE CAN INSERT A PARTITION IN THE BOX AND THE WALLS ARE PISTONS WHICH CAN BE MOVED IN AND OUT THERE ARE SOME SUBTLETIES WITH WORKING WITH A SINGLE PARTICLE IN THE ENGINE BUT IF YOU IMAGINE EVERYTHING IS OVER LONG TIMES THEN TREATING IT LIKE A GAS MAKES SENSE ACCORDING TO FEYNMAN BUT I'M SUSPICIOUS

WE FIRST PARTITION THE BOX IN HALF SO THE PARTICLE IS EITHER ON THE LEFT OR RIGHT CALL THESE TWO STATES AND WE NOW MEASURE WHICH SIDE OF THE BOX THE PARTICLE IS ON WHICH BENNETT CLAIMS CAN BE DONE WITH ZERO COST IN ENERGY AND ENTROPY WE CAN DO THIS BY COUPLING IT TO OUR DEMON A REFERENCE SZILARD ENGINE WITH A PARTITION AND A SINGLE PARTICLE INITIALLY ON THE LEFT IN STATE THE MEASUREMENT PROCESS WILL EITHER KEEP THE DEMON IN OR ADIABATICALLY MOVE THE DEMON TO DEPENDING ON THE RESULT OF THE MEASUREMENT CRUCIALLY ACCORDING TO BENNETT WE CAN ONLY DO THIS MEASUREMENT REVERSIBLY IF THE DEMON IS IN A KNOWN REFERENCE STATE WHICH I CHOOSE TO BE ARGUMENTS HERE ARE CONVINCING TO ME AND HE GIVES SOME NICE PHYSICAL EXAMPLES FOR ENACTING THE ABOVE

HERE'S WHERE THINGS GET HAIRY FOR ME AT THIS POINT THE DEMON USES THE RESULT OF THIS MEASUREMENT TO EXTRACT WORK FROM THE PARTICLE WHICH CAN BE DONE BY INSERTING A PISTON IN THE EMPTY HALF OF THE ENGINE REMOVING THE PARTITION AND LETTING THE PARTICLE PUSH THE PISTON ISOTHERMALLY NOW THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS END STATE AND THE BEGINNING STATE IS THE DEMON WE STARTED WITH THE DEMON IN AND NOW THE DEMON MAY EITHER BE IN OR DEPENDING ON THE RESULT OF THE MEASUREMENT NOW WE NEED TO RESET THE DEMON TO TO COMPLETE THE CYCLE AND THE CLAIM IS THAT THIS RESETTING ERASURE OF INFORMATION REQUIRES YOU TO DUMP HEAT BACK INTO THE RESERVOIR WHILE DOING THE NECESSARY WORK TO COMPRESS THE DEMON BACK TO

SO MY BASIC CONFUSION HERE IS WHY WE CAN USE OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE MEASUREMENT TO EXTRACT WORK FROM THE FIRST ENGINE BUT WE CANNOT ALSO USE THAT KNOWLEDGE TO KNOW WHETHER WE NEED TO RESET THE DEMON BIT BACK TO OR NOT IF WE KNOW FOR SURE WHAT STATE THE DEMON IS IN WE CAN ALWAYS SWITCH IT WITHOUT INCREASING ENTROPY AND SINCE THIS INFORMATION WAS JUST USED TO EXTRACT WORK THIS INFORMATION SEEMS TO BE KNOWN

READING ABOUT THIS IT APPEARS THAT THE ASSUMPTION INVOLVES THE DEMON DOING THE MEASUREMENT AND THE WORK WITHOUT OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE MEASUREMENT RESULT SO YOU FEED THE DEMON IN STATE INTO A MACHINE AND IT COMES OUT IN AN UNCERTAIN STATE SO I CAN'T FEED IT BACK INTO THE MACHINE WITHOUT DOING SOME WORK IN FACT THERE IS A NATURE LETTER FROM THAT CITES LANDAUER AND BENNETT WHERE EXPERIMENTALISTS SHOW THAT RESETTING SUCH A RANDOM BIT RESULTS IN THE CORRECT ENTROPY INCREASE BUT THEN IF THE DEMON IS SO SMART IT CAN MOVE PISTONS AND PARTITIONS BASED ON THE RESULT OF ITS MEASUREMENT WHY CAN'T IT RESET ITSELF BASED ON THE MEASUREMENT

PART OF MY FRUSTRATION IS THAT BENNETT GIVES REALLY NICE PHYSICAL EXAMPLES OF A DEMON THAT CAN DO MEASUREMENTS ADIABATICALLY BUT DOESN'T EXPLAIN HOW TO USE THAT MEASUREMENT TO DO WORK
AM I CRAZY NOT SEEING SOMETHING CORRECTLY OR IS THERE A FLAW IN THE CLASSICAL ENTANGLEMENT EXPERIMENT

ENTANGLEMENT VALIDATION EXPERIMENT APPEARS TO MAKE A FUNDAMENTAL FLAW IN REGARDS TO MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE 2 CONSERVATION OF ENERGY

THE EXPERIMENT CREATES TO PARTICLES WITH EQUAL AND OPPOSITE SPINS THEY CAN THEN BE BOTH SENT IN TWO DIFFERING DIRECTIONS OVER SMALL OR LARGE DISTANCES AND THEN USING A SPIN DETECTOR THEY MEASURE THE SPIN OF A PARTICLE IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE DETECTOR COINCIDENTALLY THE CORRESPONDING PARTICLE OF THE PAIR WHEN DETECTED WITH A SIMILARLY ALIGNED DETECTOR WILL HAVE THE APPROPRIATE OPPOSITE SPIN THIS EXPERIMENT IS SUPPOSED TO PROVE QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT BUT IT APPEARS IT DOES NOT SINCE 2 APPEARS TO BE COMPLETELY OVERLOOKED AS A REASON FOR THE SUPPOSED ENTANGLEMENT

WHY IS THIS SO THE MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE APPEARS SELECTIVE ONLY FOR THOSE OF A CERTAIN SPIN DIRECTION THEREFORE ONLY THOSE OF A SPIN IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE DEVICE WILL BE SEEN ONE WOULD HAVE TO CREATE A PARTICLE PAIR IN SCALE IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE A SINGLE PAIR IS ACTUALLY CREATED AND HAVE THE DETECTOR MODIFY THAT SPIN IT IS THEREFORE MORE LIKELY THAT ONLY A PAIR OF MATCHING ALIGNMENT TO THE DETECTOR ARE ACTUALLY DETECTED SINCE THE CREATION EVENT WOULD LAST MAGNITUDES LONGER THAN THE SCALE THUS MULTITUDES OF PARTICLES WOULD BE CREATED AND THEREFORE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT AT LEAST ONE OF THOSE PAIRS IS IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE DETECTOR APPROACHES THE FURTHER FROM THE PLANK YOU GET

ADDITIONALLY THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY ENSURES REGARDLESS OF THE INITIAL SPIN BOTH PARTICLES ARE ALREADY IN OPPOSITE SPIN DIRECTIONS THIS IS THESE SPINS ARE OF COURSE UNKNOWN UNTIL MEASURED IF ONE IS MEASURED THAT ONLY TELLS YOU WHAT THE SPIN OF THE OTHER SHOULD BE DUE TO THIS CONSERVATION IT DOES NOT CONFER ENTANGLEMENT JUST THAT THE LAW OF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY WAS UPHELD

BY THE ABOVE THE EXPERIMENT DOES NOT APPEAR TO CONFER ENTANGLEMENT AT ALL IT ONLY APPEARS TO BE A CONFIRMATION EVENT DUE TO CONSTRAINTS THE GUARANTEE OF IS NEAR IMPOSSIBLE AND THEREFORE THE MEASUREMENTS ONLY FIND A MATCHING PAIR DUE TO CONSERVATION OF ENERGY AND THEREFORE DO NOT CONFER ENTANGLEMENT TO EXIST

WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO IS THE PAULI EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE WHICH PREVENTS MULTIPLE FERMIONS FROM OCCUPYING THE SAME QUANTUM STATE

THIS PRINCIPLE IS THE CAUSE OF VARIOUS KINDS OF DEGENERACY PRESSURE EACH OF WHICH IS OVERCOME AS A STAR COLLAPSES SEE THIS ARTICLE FOR A REASONABLE WRITEUP

HOWEVER THIS IS A CASE WHERE THE EFFECTS OF GENERAL RELATIVITY AND QUANTUM MECHANICS ARE BOTH EXPECTED TO BE STRONG AND HENCE WHERE THE INCOMPATIBILITIES BETWEEN THE TWO THEORIES ARE PROBLEMATIC SINCE WE CURRENTLY LACK A WORKING THEORY OF QUANTUM GRAVITY TO RECONCILE THE TWO NOBODY REALLY CAN SAY FOR SURE WHAT HAPPENS AT THE CENTER OF A BLACK HOLE SAYING THAT A SINGULARITY FORMS IS IN SOME WAYS SHORTHAND FOR SAYING THAT THE THEORIES HAVE BROKEN DOWN
I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY EXAMPLE OF MAKING A SINGULARITY FROM FERMIONS YOU MIGHT BE ASKING ABOUT THE SINGULARITIES FOUND INSIDE A BLACK HOLE BUT ACCORDING TO GR SUCH A SINGULARITY IS A PLACE THERE THE SPACETIME CURVATURE BLOWS UP BLACK HOLE SINGULARITIES AREN'T MADE OF FERMIONS OR BOSONS
TODAY I READ THAT WHAT DISTINGUISHES THERMIONIC AND BOSONIC FIELDS IS MOSTLY THAT THE VALUE AT ANY GIVEN POINT CAN'T BE ANY NUMBER

THAT'S NOT QUITE RIGHT I MEAN THERE IS A CORRECT INTUITION IN THERE IT IS TRUE THAT A THERMIONIC STATE CAN ONLY BE OCCUPIED OR UNOCCUPIED OR A SUPERPOSITION OF THE TWO OF COURSE BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT A THERMIONIC FIELD MUST BE A NUMBER BETWEEN ZERO AND ONE THE WAY THIS PROPERTY CALLED THE PAULI EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE IS REALIZED AT THE LEVEL OF THE FIELD CAN BE SEEN IN THE COMMUTATION RELATIONS

A BOSONIC FIELD I X T IS GENERALLY REQUIRED TO COMMUTE FOR EQUAL TIMES

I X I Y I Y I X I X Y

WHEREAS A THERMIONIC FIELD I X T IS REQUIRED TO ANTICOMMUTE FOR EQUAL TIMES

I X I Y I Y I X I X Y

THE OBJECT ON THE RIGHT IS A DELTA FUNCTION IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS JUST KNOW THAT IT IS AN OBJECT THAT IS ZERO WHENEVER ITS ARGUMENT IS NONZERO THAT IS WHENEVER X AND Y ARE DIFFERENT

YOU SHOULD NOTICE THAT BOSONIC FIELDS BEHAVE SOMEWHAT LIKE ORDINARY NUMBERS THAT SATISFY AB BA WHILE THERMIONIC FIELDS ARE STRANGER AND LOOK LIKE THEY SATISFY AB BA THAT STRANGE CONDITION IT TURNS OUT IS ENOUGH TO GIVE EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE

BUT IN TRUTH THE NOTION OF FIELD VALUES SHOULD BE INTERPRETED WITH CARE EVEN A BOSONIC FIELD IS NOT A NUMBER IT IS AN OPERATOR VALUED DISTRIBUTION NOTICE THAT WHEN X Y THE FIELD DOES NOT SATISFY THE NUMBEDNESS CONDITION AB BA

IN CERTAIN CONTEXTS IT MAY BE APPROPRIATE TO PRETEND THAT THE FIELD IS ALMOST CLASSICAL AND THEREFORE A NUMBER BUT FERMION FIELDS ARE NEVER REALLY ALMOST CLASSICAL JUST LIKE SOMEONE CAN'T BE JUST A LITTLE PREGNANT THE CONDITION AB BA IS ALWAYS VERY NOTICEABLE

THE GIST OF ALL THIS IS THAT YOUR QUESTION AS STATED IS NOT VERY WELL POSED BECAUSE IT RELIES ON CLASSICAL INTUITIONS THAT FAIL IN THE REGIME YOU'RE INTERESTED IN

IF YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT GRAVITATIONAL SINGULARITIES THEN THERE'S A SIMPLER ANSWER THERE ARE NO PARTICLES IN AN IDEALIZED BLACK HOLE WHETHER BOSONIC OR THERMIONIC NONE IT IS WHAT IS CALLED A VACUUM SOLUTION OF GENERAL RELATIVITY THERE IS NO MASS AND NO ENERGY ANYWHERE THE SINGULARITY IS NOT PART OF THE SPACETIME REALLY IT'S A POINT THAT'S MISSING JUST LIKE THE ORIGIN IS MISSING FROM THE DOMAIN OF THE FUNCTION X

PHYSICALLY THIS IS PROBABLY NOT TRUE BUT UNDERSTANDING IT WOULD REQUIRE A THEORY OF QUANTUM GRAVITY WHICH AT PRESENT WE DON'T HAVE

FIRST LEPTON FLAVOR IS ALREADY KNOWN TO BE VIOLATED SEE RECENT NOBEL PRIZE AS FOR LEPTON NUMBER THERE ARE MANY EXPERIMENTS LOOKING FOR THIS UNDER THE AWKWARD TITLE NEUTRINOLESS DOUBLE BETA DECAY AND IT IS GENERALLY THOUGHT TO BE A RATHER PLAUSIBLE POSSIBILITY I THINK THAT MOST NEUTRINO THEORISTS THINK HOPE YEARN ETC THAT NEUTRINOS ARE MEJORANA ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE FOR THIS YET NOR WOULD THERE BE AT CURRENT SENSITIVITIES

UNDER THE ASSUMPTION PRESENTED THEN ESSENTIALLY YES

THAT SAID YOUR QUESTION IS AT THE HEART OF THE RECENT DISCUSSION OF THE INFORMATION PARADOX WE DON'T WANT TO ADMIT BUT GETTING AROUND IT REQUIRES A BIG EFFORT
YES BLACK HOLES VIOLATE THE CONSERVATION LAWS ASSOCIATED TO THE GLOBAL SYMMETRIES OF THE STANDARD MODEL LIKE BARYON NUMBER LEPTON NUMBER ETC

YOU CAN DROP BARYONS OR LEPTONS INTO A BLACK HOLE AND IT WILL FORGET ABOUT THEM AND AFTER ITS EVAPORATION YOU'D BE LEFT WITH A DIFFERENT LEPTON BARYON WHATEVER NUMBER THAN BEFORE

BLACK HOLES INSTEAD PRESERVE QUANTUM NUMBERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SYMMETRIES OF THE BACKGROUND SPACETIME SO ENERGY LINEAR MOMENTUM AND ANGULAR MOMENTUM AND GAUGE SYMMETRIES LIKE ELECTRIC CHARGE MAGNETIC CHARGE WEAK ISOSPIN DEPENDING ON WHICH THEORY YOU'RE CONSIDERING A BLACK HOLE CAN HAVE MULTIPLE CHARGES UNDER THE VARIOUS GAUGE INTERACTIONS
THE THEOREM STATING THAT BLACK HOLES ARE FULLY SPECIFIED BY THOSE PROPERTIES DOES HAVE LIMITATIONS FOR EXAMPLE IT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT YOU'D SEE IF YOU JUMPED IN ALL OBVIOUSLY SPECULATIVE BUT REASONABLE PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT A GUY FALLING THROUGH THE EVENT HORIZON FEET INSIDE ALREADY HEAD SOON TO GO IN WILL SOON HAPPILY FIND THAT HIS FEET WILL HAVE HAVE BEEN ON THE INSIDE

CIRC IT'S ALSO A THING AND PERHAPS OF ONLY LIMITED APPLICABILITY TO BLACK HOLES HAPPY TO BE CORRECTED HERE THOUGH
I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW BUT I HAVE 2 PROBABLE ANSWERS
BLACK HOLES ARE MYSTERIOUS AND THERE ARE MASSIVE PARADOXES AROUND THEM THAT NEED TO BE SOLVED
2 IT TAKES AN INFINITE AMOUNT OF TIME FOR ANY MATTER TO FALL INTO A BLACK HOLE THINGS MOVE FROM AN OUTSIDE PERSPECTIVE EXPONENTIALLY SLOWER AS THEY APPROACH THE EVENT HORIZON DUE TO THE EFFECT GRAVITY HAS ON TIME THEREFORE EVERYTHING THAT COULD HAVE FALLEN IN STAYS STUCK ON THE EDGE OF A BLACK HOLE THIS WOULD I WOULD THINK MEAN THAT A BLACK HOLE NEVER TRULY FORMS FROM AN EXTERNAL REFERENCE FRAME AND SO THIS PROBLEM WILL NEVER OCCUR

HOWEVER THESE ARE JUST MY ANSWERS BASED OFF A SUSSKIND LECTURE AND A PAPER ON DARK STARS I HOPE AN ACTUAL PHYSICIST WILL HELP
ANSWERING YOUR FIRST QUESTION WHAT DO YOU KNOW SO FAR GR RESTS ON PRETTY MUCH THE WHOLE OF CLASSICAL PHYSICS YOU SHOULD KNOW CLASSICAL MECHANICS INCLUDING THE LAGRANGIAN AND HAMILTONIAN FORMULATIONS AND ELECTROMAGNETISM THE FULL VERSION WITH THE WHOLE OF EQUATIONS QUANTUM MECHANICS IS NOT REALLY NECESSARY BUT IT DOESN'T HURT

THE MATH IS FIRST WHAT COMES WITH ALL THE PHYSICS PREPREGS SINGLE AND MULTI VARIABLE CALCULUS LINEAR ALGEBRA DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS YOU'LL ALSO NEED DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY WHICH IS TYPICALLY EXPLAINED IN MOST GR BOOKS

JUST TO GIVE A SHORT ANSWER TO THE GENERAL PHYSICS QUESTION

STARS ARE GIANT MASSES OF HOT HYDROGEN AND HELIUM THE TEMPERATURE IS HIGH ENOUGH THAT MUCH OF THE MATERIAL IS IONIZED THE PROTONS AND ELECTRONS ARE DISASSOCIATED FROM EACH OTHER IN THE INTERIOR OF THE SUN THIS IONIZED MATERIAL CAN SWIRL AROUND AND SINCE IT'S MADE UP OF CHARGED PARTICLES THE MOTION OF THOSE CHARGED PARTICLES PRODUCES A MAGNETIC FIELD THE LARGE-SCALE MOTIONS OF THIS IONIZED MATERIAL PARTICULARLY IN THE TRANSITIONAL LAYER BETWEEN THE OUTER SURFACE THAT ROTATES LIKE A NORMAL FLUID AND THE INNER CORE THAT ROTATES MORE RIGIDLY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CHANGES IN THE SUN'S MAGNETIC FIELD OVER TIME

BUT AS ALREADY POINTED OUT THESE CHANGES ARE BASICALLY PERIODIC WE DON'T OBSERVE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN AVERAGE MAGNITUDE OVER TIME

EDIT AND JUST TO CLARIFY THE STRENGTH OF A MAGNETIC FIELD HAS NO GENERAL CORRELATION WITH ENTROPY DEPENDING UPON THE SYSTEM THE LOWEST ENTROPY STATE COULD HAVE MAGNETIC FIELD OR A LARGE MAGNETIC FIELD IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE SYSTEM
THERE IS A STATEMENT SAYING THAT THE SUN'S MAGNETIC FIELD HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED IN STRENGTH IN THE CENTURY DEFLECTING MORE COSMIC RAYS DECREASING CLOUD COVER AND LEADING TO A TEMPERATURE INCREASE ON EARTH

THE SUN'S MEAN MAGNETIC FIELD STRENGTH HASN'T CHANGED APPRECIABLY OVER THAT TIME PERIOD THE SUN'S MAGNETIC FIELD SWITCHES POLARITY ABOUT EVERY YEARS BUT ITS MEAN VALUE IS ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED

COSMIC RAYS THAT APPROACH EARTH ARE TO SOME EXTENT DEFLECTED BY MAGNETIC FIELD BUT NOT TO AN APPRECIABLE DEGREE BY THE SUN'S MAGNETIC FIELD AS IT APPEARS IN THE VICINITY OF THE EARTH

HOW COULD THIS FIELD INCREASE OCCUR

NOT REALLY NECESSARY TO SAY HOW SINCE IT'S NOT TRUE THE SOLAR MAGNETIC MEAN VALUE IS UNCHANGED AND AGAIN IT SWITCHES POLARITY ABOUT EVERY YEARS AND EVEN IF THE SUN'S MAGNETIC FIELD DID CHANGE THE PRIMARY MAGNETIC DEFLECTION OF COSMIC RAYS NEAR EARTH IS THE MAGNETIC FIELD NOT THE SUN'S ALSO THAT DEFLECTION DOESN'T PREVENT COSMIC RAYS FROM ENTERING ATMOSPHERE IT ONLY CHANGES WHERE THEY ENTER NOT WHETHER THEY ENTER

MY POINT I THINK THIS IS A CRACKPOT THEORY MORE HERE HENRIK SVENSMARK
NOBODY HERE KNOWS WHAT PHY IS
NOT TOO RELEVANT BUT JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THAT WAS OUR UNDERGRADUATE TEXTBOOK AND I FOUND IT TO BE REALLY GREAT BOTH AS A TEXTBOOK ALONE AND AS A REFERENCE TO COME BACK TO DEFINITELY MY FAVOURITE COMPREHENSIVE PHYSICS TEXTBOOK I DIDN'T FIND IT TOO THEORETICAL AT ALL REALLY IT HAD A LOT OF EXERCISES IN IF I RECALL CORRECTLY
BUT IT TALKS MORE ABOUT THEORY RATHER THAN GIVING ME FACTS THAT I CAN ACTIVELY USE TO SOLVE PROBLEMS

FRANKLY THIS IS THE CASE WITH ALMOST ALL PHYSICS YOU LEARN THE THEORY ON THE SIMPLEST IDEALISED SYSTEMS WHICH ARE OFTEN VERY FAR REMOVED FROM REAL WORLD PROBLEMS IF THAT'S WHAT YOUR MODULE IS ABOUT FOCUS ON JUST LEARNING THE THEORY IMO VERY FREQUENTLY YOU HAVE TO SUSPEND YOUR INTUITION AND JUST RUN WITH THE IDEAS TO SEE WHERE YOU GET AS THEIR RELEVANCE OR IMPORTANCE WILL NOT BE IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUS I HAD THE SAME BOOK FOR UNDERGRAD AND THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT LOTS OF PRACTICE PROBLEMS AND VERY CLEAR EXPLANATIONS

WITH THE FIRST HOUR TYPICALLY SPENT ON TRYING TO SOLVE REVIEW PROBLEMS IN THE TEXTBOOK

THIS IS GENERALLY NOT AT ALL A WASTE OF TIME CAN YOU SOLVE THE PROBLEMS EASILY WITHOUT HELP
IF THE BOOK ISN'T WORKING FOR YOU SEEK OUT ANOTHER AT THE LIBRARY OR ONLINE WE USED GIANCOLI FOR FRESHMEN PHYSICS AND I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY GOOD HALLIDAY AND RESNICK IS ANOTHER POPULAR BOOK THERE IS NO BETTER WAY TO LEARN INTRO PHYSICS THAN GRAPPLING WITH THE BOOK AND DOING PROBLEMS WHEN I TOOK IT I FOUND THE BOOK TOOK ME OF THE WAY THE LECTURES ABOUT AND THE LABS 2

SCIENCE PHYSICS

KHAN ACADEMY IS AMAZING FOR MINI VIDEO LECTURES I HAVEN'T BEEN ON THE SITE IN A WHILE BUT REMEMBER IT BEING VERY HELPFUL FOR PHYSICS CHEMISTRY AND MATHEMATICS

GOOD LUCK AND NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF UNDERSTANDING THEORY IF YOU KNOW THE THEORY AND THE UNITS THEN YOU WON'T EVEN NEED TO MEMORIZE EQUATIONS BECAUSE THEY WILL BECOME INTUITIVE
WIKIPEDIA HERE

THE WAY YOU POSED YOUR QUESTION SUGGESTS A MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANISM OF BREMSSTRAHLUNG THOUGH THE IONS PARTICIPATE IT IS THE ELECTRONS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE BREMSSTRAHLUNG RADIATION THE REASON DIFFERENT FUELS ARE QUOTED AS HAVING DIFFERENT BREMSSTRAHLUNG LOSSES IS BECAUSE THE FUELS REQUIRE DIFFERENT CONDITIONS ON THE PLASMA TO OPTIMALLY PRODUCE FUSION ENERGY THE DIFFERENCES IN THESE CONDITIONS IMPLY DIFFERENT PARAMETERS FOR THE ELECTRON COMPONENT OF THE PLASMA SO THE REACTION DOES NOT DETERMINE THE BREMSSTRAHLUNG PER SE
I WOULD ALSO BE QUITE INTERESTED IN ANY SUCH RESOURCES AS I'M CURRENTLY RESEARCHING NUCLEAR FUSION ANY HELP WOULD BE APPRECIATED
FUSION YIELDS A HELIUM A PHOTON AND A NEUTRON SEEING AS THERE IS NO ENERGETIC ELECTRON BYPRODUCT OF FUSION THERE SHOULD BE NO BREMSSTRAHLUNG RADIATION THIS IS OF COURSE NOT CONSIDERING THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE REACTION OCCURS WHICH SURELY CONTAINS A LARGE NUMBER OF FREE ELECTRONS

I GUESS I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT YOU'RE ASKING IN REGARDS TO BREMSSTRAHLUNG AND FUSION IF YOU COULD CLARIFY YOUR QUESTION A BIT I MIGHT BE OF MORE HELP
GIVING A TALK AT A CONFERENCE TOMORROW SO I'M SITTING IN MY HOTEL ROOM PRACTICING TIMINGS THEY HAVE ME ON AFTER TWO KEYNOTE SPEAKERS AND A TUTORIAL SESSION SO I'M A SMALL BIT NERVOUS
WORKING ON THEORY SHOWING DARK MATTER IS ACTUALLY JUST TIGHTLY BOUND COLLECTIONS OF SUPER DENSE GARDEN GNOMES ITS SUPER OBVIOUS WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT AND THE CONCLUSIONS IT GIVES FOR QUANTUM PHYSIC
CLASSES ABOUT TO START IN A FEW DAYS HAD A LONG BREAK FROM DOING ANY PHYSICS OR MATH 2 MONTHS SUMMER SO IT'S GOING TO BE WARMING UP THE FIRST TWO WEEKS
FINISHING UP A SCRIPT FOR MY RESEARCH PROJECT IT STILL NEEDS SOME TWEAKING BEFORE I CAN ACTUALLY USE IT BUT I'M PROUD OF THE PROGRESS I'VE MADE SO FAR HOPEFULLY MY MENTOR S SEE IT THAT WAY TOO ASIDE FROM THAT STUDYING AND PANICKING ABOUT THE PHYSICS GRE AND DOING HOMEWORK
WORKING ON SOME HARDWARE R D NEEDLESS TO SAY I'M CONFUSED
I'M WORKING ON SOME RESEARCH REGARDING THE SCATTERING OF ENTANGLED PHOTONS CREATED BY POSITRONIUM ANTIMATTER MATTER ANNIHILATION

I'M ALSO WORKING WITH A GROUP ON OUR PRESENTATION ABOUT SEA ICE THICKNESS IN BARROW ALASKA FOR THE AGU MEETING IN DECEMBER
PROCRASTINATING ABOUT MY MASTERS THESIS DOPPLER IMAGING OF STELLAR SURFACE FEATURES ON ULTRA RAPID ROTATOR HIP
ANALYSING DATA FOR MY EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS CLASSICAL DOING AN EXPERIMENT ON ULTRASONICS IN DIFFERENT MATERIALS FUN TIMES
WORKING ON A THEORY ON HOW DARK MATTER IS HIGHER DIMENSIONAL MATTER WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN WHY WE CAN SEE EFFECT ON IT BUT CANNOT OTHERWISE SEE IT
WORKING ON A THEORY SHOWING DARK MATTER DOES NOT EXIST IS NOT MATTER
EVERYONE HERE IS POSTING LINKS TO WIKIPEDIA ARTICLES ABOUT THE PLANCK TIME AND CAN'T EVEN BE BOTHERED TO LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT IT FROM THE WIKI ARTICLE

BECAUSE THE PLANCK TIME COMES FROM DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS WHICH IGNORES CONSTANT FACTORS THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT EXACTLY ONE UNIT OF PLANCK TIME HAS ANY SPECIAL PHYSICAL SIGNIFICANCE RATHER THE PLANCK TIME REPRESENTS A ROUGH TIME SCALE AT WHICH QUANTUM GRAVITATIONAL EFFECTS ARE LIKELY TO BECOME IMPORTANT

PUT SIMPLY WE DON'T HAVE A THEORY THAT DISCRETIZES TIME BOTH QUANTUM THEORY AND GENERAL RELATIVITY USE TIME AS A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE

AND MAYBE THE UNIVERSE WORKS THAT WAY MAYBE NOT
IF YOU HAVE A MINIMUM TIME STEP IN ONE REFERENCE FRAME IN ANOTHER EVERYTHING LOOKS FUCKED UP AND THE DISCRETE STEPS HAPPEN AT DIFFERENT TIMES IN DIFFERENT PLACES ALSO THE DURATION OF THE TIMESTAMP IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF RELATIVITY OF SIMULTANEITY AND TIME DILATION

SO YOU REALLY NEED A GOOD EXPLANATION FOR WHY WE OBSERVE LORENTZ INVARIANCE AT LARGE SCALES

THIS TURNS OUT TO BE A REALLY NASTY PROBLEM SO ONE SHOULD FIRST FIGURE OUT HOW TO EVEN FORMULATE THIS HYPOTHESIS COHERENTLY AND THEN MAYBE THINK ABOUT PREDICTIONS
IT KIND OF SUCKS THAT YOU ASKED AN INTERESTING QUESTION BUT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT THE PLANCK TIME WHICH HAS NO RELATION TO THIS THAT SAID I HAVE NO IDEA YOU CERTAINLY CAN'T MEASURE ANYTHING MORE THAN EVER ONCE PER TICK SO THE SIMPLEST IDEAS ARE OUT THE WINDOW DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY IDEAS
THE PLANCK TIME IS NOT A IT'S JUST A CONSTANT CONSTRUCTED FROM PHYSICAL PARAMETERS
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO APPLY WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SUGGEST TO THE PHYSICAL WORLD BUT THE MATH BEHIND IT IS RELEVANT TO YOUR QUESTION PERHAPS BRIGHTER MINDS THAN MINE COULD ADAPT IT TO AN EXPERIMENT

THERE ARE TWO EQUATIONS WORTH MENTIONING CALLED THE LOGISTIC FUNCTION AND THE LOGISTIC MAP THE FIRST IS A CONTINUOUS FUNCTION WHILE THE LATTER IS DISCRETE THE CONTINUOUS FUNCTION PERHAPS ANALOGOUS TO AN INFINITELY DIVISIBLE SHOWS A SMOOTH TRANSITION BETWEEN STATES AND GENERALLY COMES TO A STEADY STATE THE DISCRETE MAP DOES NOT IT DISPLAYS CHAOTIC BEHAVIOR INFINITELY PRODUCING A STRING OF OUTPUTS

THESE FUNCTIONS ARE DIRECTLY ANALOGOUS IN CONSTRUCTION BUT DISPLAY QUALITATIVELY DIFFERENT BEHAVIORS BASED ON THE CRITERIA YOUR QUESTION GETS AT
I BELIEVE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY REQUIRES CONTINUOUS TIME SYMMETRY SO IF WE WOULD FIND SMALL ENERGY VIOLATIONS THIS COULD INDICATE TIME DISCRETIZATION VERY HYPOTHETICAL THOUGH I'M JUST RAMBLING
I CAN'T IMAGINE ANY WAY TO DESIGN AN EXPERIMENT THAT COULD MEASURE THIS BECAUSE ANY METHOD OF MEASUREMENT IS GOING TO RELY UPON A MECHANISM OF TRANSFERRING INFORMATION AND THAT IS GOING TO INTRODUCE ISSUES OF SIMULTANEITY MENTIONED HERE THIS IS AN INTERESTING THOUGHT EXPERIMENT THOUGH IT KEEPS BRINGING ME BACK TO APR HAMM
IS SPACETIME QUANTIZED IN LAG OR CAN IT BE
FOR THE THEORISTS IS THERE ARE THEORY OUT THERE THAT QUANTIES TIME
THERE IS SO CALLED DOUBLY SPECIAL RELATIVITY BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT PREDICTIONS MADE BY THOSE THEORIES
I'M NO EXPERT SO FORGIVE ME IF I HAVE SOME HORRIBLE MISCONCEPTION BUT DON'T WE KNOW THE PLANCK LENGTH COULDN'T IT JUST BE THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES FOR LIGHT IN A VACUUM TO TRAVEL THE PLANCK LENGTH
SUCH AS THE SMALLEST DISTANCE THAT LIGHT CAN MOVE THAT IS MEASURABLE

WIKI
WELL THE THEORETICAL SMALLEST UNIT OF TIME IS THE PLANCK SECOND WHICH IS DEFINED AS THE TIME IT TAKES LIGHT TO TRAVEL PLANCK LENGTH THE SMALLEST THEORETICAL DISTANCE MEASURING THIS HOWEVER IS A DIFFERENT STORY THE WORLD RECORD FOR SMALLEST UNIT OF TIME MEASURED IS ABOUT ATTOSECONDS LINK TO ARTICLE BELOW THIS IS ABOUT 2 PLANCK SECONDS SO IN REALITY WE ARE STILL VERY FAR AWAY FROM BEING ABLE TO MEASURE THIS

ER APR
ORDINARY QUANTUM TELEPORTATION HAS ALL OF THE NECESSARY PROPERTIES THE EP APR STUFF IS ONLY INTERPRETATIONAL IN THIS CONTEXT

ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU'VE PREVIOUSLY SCANNED BOTH THEN ITS FEASIBLE TO REPAIR MOST OF THE DAMAGE SO THIS COULD BE HANDY FOR REPLICATING IRREPLACEABLE OBJECTS

THAT'S UNLIKELY THE THEOREM TELLS US THAT QUANTUM TELEPORTATION IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE DESTRUCTIVE
REALLY IMPRESSIVE CANT HELP BUT THINK ABOUT THE FIRST BOOK IN THE CHINESE SCI-FI TRILOGY THREE BODY
HOW DOES A GIANT TELESCOPE LIKE THIS COMPARE WITH SAY THE PROPOSED SQUARE KILOMETRE ARRAY

ARE THEY DETECTING DIFFERENT EMISSIONS OR ARE THEY JUST TWO DIFFERENT APPROACHES
HOLY SHIT THIS IS BIG GLAD SOMEONE ELSE THAN THE WEST IS TAKING SCIENCE SERIOUSLY
LEGITIMATE QUESTION FROM AN UNDERGRAD IN THE US SINCE MUCH OF THE SCIENCE COMMUNITY HERE IS AFFECTED BY THE CUTS BEING DONE BY GOVERNMENT IS IT WISE TO LOOK INTO LEARNING CHINESE FOR POTENTIAL RESEARCH JOBS SINCE THEY ARE FAST BECOMING A SCIENTIFIC LEADER IN THE WORLD
ROGUE TRANSMISSION
AND NOW PUERTO RICO HAS NOTHING
I WANT TO SKATEBOARD IN THAT
I'M GLAD CHINA IS PICKING UP THE SLACK LEFT BY THE FUNDING GLUT IN THE US AND EUROPE
BANANA FOR SCALE
NOT AT ALL I WAS MAKING A POOR JOKE BASED OFF OF SOME OF PREVIOUS MISADVENTURES WITH SPACE TECHNOLOGY LIKE THE JADE RABBIT DYING AND THEIR SPACE STATION THAT'S SLOWLY TUMBLING INTO ATMOSPHERE AS WELL AS PENCHANT FOR SAYING EVERYTHING IS GOING GREAT WITH X WHEN IN FACT IT MAY BE GOING TERRIBLY OR AT LEAST NOT PROGRESSING AS WELL AS THEY SAY IT IS
THERE'S EXACTLY NO WAY YOU COULD HAVE GOTTEN THAT FROM MY COMMENT THUS A POOR JOKE
I'M WAITING FOR THE PART WHERE IT FRIES SATELLITES BECAUSE IT WAS CALIBRATED WRONG
OR IT JUST GIVES EVERYONE CANCER IN A FIFTEEN MILE RADIUS AND THEY MAKE SOMETHING UP
AND
NOBODY AGREES ON THIS ALL YOU CAN DO IS COLLECT OPINIONS

PERSONALLY I WOULD SAY YOU ARE A PHYSICIST IF YOUR JOB OR THE MAIN THING YOU DO WITH YOUR LIFE PRINCIPALLY CONSISTS OF DOING PHYSICS RESEARCH GIVEN THAT DEFINITION AND THE NORMAL PROGRESSION OF ACADEMIA THAT MEANS THE EARLIEST YOU COULD CALL YOURSELF A PHYSICIST WOULD BE AS A PHD STUDENT WHO IS DONE TAKING CLASSES AND IS JUST WORKING ON RESEARCH
YEAH THIS IS A HARD QUESTION THE USUAL VERY STRONG MEANING I KNOW OF IS SOMEONE WHO ACQUIRED A PHD IN PHYSICS AND ACTIVELY DOES RESEARCH IN PHYSICS THIS IS QUITE A GOOD DEFINITION WHEN IT COMES TO TERMS OF THIS GUY SURELY KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT WITH THIS DEFINITION ANGELA MERKEL FOR EXAMPLE IS NOT A PHYSICIST EVEN THOUGH SHE HOLDS A PHD IN PHYSICS SHE DOESN'T DO ANY RESEARCH AND SHE HERSELF STATED THAT THIS WAS ANOTHER LIFE IT IS ALSO A DEFINITION THAT WOULD HOLD MOST LIKELY IN COURT

BUT THEN AGAIN I'D SAY TO FIRST ORDER A PHYSICIST IS SOMEONE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE FUNDAMENTAL WORKINGS OF THE UNIVERSE ON A SERIOUS SCIENTIFIC BASIS THIS DEFINITION INCLUDES FAMOUS HISTORIC PHYSICISTS LIKE NEWTON EVEN THOUGH HE DIDN'T ACQUIRE A PHD IN PHYSICS IT ALSO INCLUDES PHYSICS STUDENTS WHO AS PHYSICISTS IN TRAINING DO NOT DO ANY SERIOUS SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH BUT LEARN THE APPROPRIATE MEASURES FOR IT
THERE ISN'T AN OFFICIAL LICENSING ORGANIZATION FOR PHYSICISTS COUNTY FOLIO LAWYERS WITH STATE BARS MEDICAL DOCTORS WITH STATE MEDICAL BOARDS ETC AND IT'S NOT ILLEGAL TO REPRESENT YOURSELF AS A PHYSICIST WITHOUT APPROPRIATE CERTIFICATION SO GO HOG WILD WITH IT DUDE
I THINK AN UNDERGRADUATE COULD CALL THEMSELVES A PHYSICIST IF THEY HAVE A KEEN INTEREST IN THE FIELD I'D SAY THAT IF YOU'RE COMING TO THE END OF YOUR UNDERGRAD AT LEAST IN THE UK THEN IT IS FAIR TO SAY YOU WILL BE IN YOUR PRIME AND KNOW THE MOST PHYSICS YOU'LL EVER KNOW

PHS AND POSTDOCS ACTUALLY TEND TO HAVE LESS PHYSICS KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE ALL OF THEIR KNOWLEDGE IS CONCENTRATED IN ONE VERY SPECIALISED AREA OF PHYSICS

FOR EXPERIMENTALISTS THIS WILL MEAN THAT THEY HAVE A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE AND TRICKS INVOLVED IN BUILDING AND OPERATING AN EXPERIMENT WHICH MAY NEED A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE THAT ISN'T EVEN FOUND IN BOOKS

FOR THEORISTS THOUGH I'D SAY THAT THEY MAY NEVER REACH THEIR PRIME IN THAT THEY ATTAIN MORE AND MORE CONCEPTUAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE UNIVERSE BUT ARE STILL EXPECTED TO BE EXTREMELY FLUENT IN THE FUNDAMENTALS AND MATHEMATICS IT'S ACCEPTABLE FOR SOMEONE WORKING IN COLD ATOMS TO HAVE FORGOTTEN THEIR VECTOR IDENTITIES BUT FOR A THEORIST THAT WON'T BE TRUE THEORISTS ALSO HAVE MORE REQUIRED MODULES

SO I'D SAY IT DEPENDS WHAT YOU MEAN BUT THERE ARE REALLY TWO DEFINITIONS OF PHYSICIST EITHER

CONCEPTUAL EXCELLENCE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU UNDERSTAND A WIDE RANGE OF PHYSICS ON AN INTUITIVE LEVEL AND FEEL FLUENT IN SOLVING PROBLEMS AND HAVE SOME DEGREE OF KNOWLEDGE AT APPLYING THESE CONCEPTS TO PROBLEMS YOU COULD PROBABLY COME UP WITH EXPERIMENTS TO TEST MANY OF THE RESULTS YOU HAVE LEARNT

2 PRACTICAL EXCELLENCE YOU WORK AS A PART OF AN EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH GROUP AND HAVE A LARGE AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE WITH YOUR EXPERIMENTAL SETUP YOU HAVE A LARGE BODY OF INFORMATION THAT IS SPECIFIC TO YOUR EXPERIMENT BUT NOT REQUIRED FOR A THEORETICAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE SUBJECT YOU ARE USED TO WRITING REPORTS AND NOTEBOOKS AND IMPROVISING WHEN THINGS GO WRONG

ALL UNDERGRADUATES IN THE UK APPROACH NUMBER AND DEPENDING ON YOUR DEDICATION AND MODULE CHOICES I'D SAY YOU COULD COME CLOSE TO ATTAINING IT IN AN UNDERGRAD

NORMAL PHYSICISTS NOT THEORETICAL WILL ALSO GET A BIT OF 2 UNDER THEIR BELT

THEORETICAL PHYSICISTS WILL PROBABLY NEVER LEARN ANY OF 2 AND WILL CONTINUE WITH

ALSO I DON'T KNOW IF ITS JUST MY UNI BUT PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE EVEN FROM FIRST YEAR REFERS TO EACH OTHER THEMSELVES AS PHYSICISTS IF YOU SEE A GROUP OF PHYSICS STUDENTS YOU WILL CALL THEM PHYSICISTS GENERALLY THE THEORY STUDENTS ARE REFERRED TO AS THEORISTS THEN AGAIN OUR DEPARTMENT IS EXTREMELY INCLUSIVE IN THAT RESPECT
LAST WEEK R MATH HAD A SIMILAR DISCUSSION ABOUT WHEN IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO CALL YOURSELF A MATHEMATICIAN THE ANSWER I FOUND MOST TRUE IS THAT YOU'RE A MATHEMATICIAN WHEN YOU HAVE A PHD AND ARE PAID TO DO RESEARCH IN THE FIELD

R MATH COMMENTS
PERSONALLY I WOULD SAY IF YOU ARE STUDYING PHYSICS FULL TIME AND OR CONDUCTING PHYSICS RESEARCH
I CALL MYSELF A PHYSICIST BECAUSE I HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN PHYSICS I ENJOY READING AND TALKING ABOUT THE LATEST ADVANCES IN ASTRONOMY AND IN PARTICLE PHYSICS BUT I HAVE NEVER ACTUALLY PARTICIPATED IN SAID RESEARCH

MY JOB IS TO TEACH MATHEMATICS I HAVE A MASTER'S DEGREE IN MATHEMATICS I HAVE A HARD TIME CALLING MYSELF A MATHEMATICIAN BECAUSE I NEVER REALLY GOT MATHEMATICS RESEARCH
PHYSICIST ISN'T STRICTLY DEFINED ESSENTIALLY ANYONE CAN CALL THEMSELVES A PHYSICIST IF THEY ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE STUDY OF PHYSICS IF YOU LOVE THE SUBJECT THEN I WOULD AVOID ASSIGNING MEANINGLESS LABELS TO PEOPLE BASED ON THEIR LEVEL OF EXPERIENCE
CLEARLY WHEN YOU ACTUALLY DO PHYSICS LEARNING PHYSICS IS NOT DOING PHYSICS IM AN 3RD YEAR UNDERGRAD I AM NOT A PHYSICIST IT WOULD NOT BE FAIR TO CLAIM TO BE

HAS TO BE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY DO A PHD
THE ONLY WAY PHYCISISTS CAN TEST IF TWO PARTICLES WERE ENTANGLED AT THE POINT OF MEASUREMENT IS TO MEET UP AFTERWARD AND COMPARE NOTES LOCALLY YOU CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE THAT MAKES YOUR EXPERIMENT LESS THAN PRACTICAL

WHILE I DON'T KNOW OF ANY POLLS I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THE MAJORITY OF PHYCISISTS WHO THINK ABOUT THIS ISSUE DON'T ACTUALLY THINK INFORMATION IS LOST I RECOMMEND SUSSKIND S BOOK BLACK HOLE WAR MY BATTLE WITH STEPHEN HAWKING TO MAKE THE WORLD SAFE FOR QUANTUM MECHANICS OR FIND SOME YOUTUBE VIDEOS WHERE HE TALKS ABOUT THE BLACK HOLE WARS
I THINK THE LEAST PROBLEMATIC ASPECT OF YOUR PROPOSED EXPERIMENT IS THAT IT NEEDS A BLACK HOLE
EDIT A WARNING TO OTHERS WHO MIGHT THINK ABOUT REPLYING TO A QUESTION LIKE THIS ONE ALL TOO OFTEN A POSTER POSTS WHAT APPEARS TO BE A QUESTION ABOUT A CRACKPOT THEORY BUT THE REAL PURPOSE IS TO PUBLICIZE THE ORIGINAL CRACKPOT IDEA MASQUERADING AS A QUESTION THEN SOMEONE FOOLISHLY REPLIES TO THE FAUX QUESTION BY CORRECTLY IDENTIFYING THE ORIGINAL CONTENT AS UNPHYSICAL NONSENSE AS CRACKPOTTERY THEN THE OP DOWNVOTES THE TECHNICALLY CORRECT REPLY

SUCH THINGS HAPPEN EVERY DAY IN TECHNICAL FORUMS THE POINT THE OP WANTS THE ORIGINAL POST TO STAND AS PROOF BY POPULAR ACCLAIM ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM OF THE ORIGINAL CRACKPOT IDEA HE DOESN'T ACTUALLY WANT ANYONE REPLYING TO IT EXCEPT POSSIBLY IN INNOCENT ADULATION

SO IT GOES



DEFINE FOR REAL CAN THESE IDEAS BE TESTED FOR FEASIBILITY NO THEY CAN'T ARE THEY SCIENCE ALREADY ANSWERED BY SAYING THEY CAN'T BE TESTED

AS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF NONSENSE IN THIS PATENT THE SUBMITTER JUXTAPOSES MAGNETIC FIELDS AND SPACETIME CURVATURE AS THOUGH THEY HAVE SOME RELATION TO EACH OTHER THEY DON'T THE PATENT IS NONSENSE AND WAS ISSUED ONLY BECAUSE PATENT EXAMINERS DON'T ACTUALLY REVIEW THE CONTENT OF SUBMISSIONS ANY MORE

I MEAN IT'S NOT AS THOUGH PATENT EXAMINERS ARE EINSTEIN
THE REASON THE DELTA FUNCTION EXISTS IS BECAUSE IT IS VERY USEFUL PROBABLY THE FIRST PLACE THAT YOU'LL SEE IT IS IN ELECTROSTATICS WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT POINT CHARGES IT IS CONVENIENT TO WORK WITH THE DENSITY OF A CHARGE BECAUSE LAW IS ONLY VALID FOR INFINITESIMALLY SMALL CHARGES SO YOU SET UP LAW WITH A DENSITY AND THEN INTEGRATE THAT RELATION OVER A VOLUME TO END UP WITH A FORCE IN THE END SO WHAT IS THE DENSITY OF A POINT CHARGE ITS VOLUME IS INFINITELY SMALL BUT IT HAS A FINITE CHARGE SO ITS DENSITY IS INFINITE AT THE ONE EXACT POSITION IT EXISTS AND ZERO EVERY WHERE ELSE THIS MEANS YOU NEED A FUNCTION THAT YOU CAN INTEGRATE OVER EXACTLY ONE POINT AND GET A FINITE VALUE THIS IS THE DEFINITION OF A DELTA FUNCTION
I THINK IT ALL BOILS DOWN TO THE DIRAC DELTA BEING A THE FOURIER TRANSFORM OF AND B THE IDENTITY FOR CONVOLUTIONS BOTH FUNDAMENTAL TOOLS FOR PHYSICS OR MORE SIMPLY IT'S LITERALLY THE SIMPLEST NONTRIVIAL FUNCTIONAL YOU CAN THINK OF
I DON'T HAVE A PHYSICS BACKGROUND SO I WON'T TALK ABOUT THE NECESSITY OF THE DELTA FUNCTION IN PHYSICS I CAN TALK A LITTLE ABOUT YOUR SIDE NOTE THOUGH IT'S A LITTLE DECEPTIVE TO SAY THAT THE DELTA FUNCTION EXISTS THERE IS NO FUNCTION THAT IS ZERO EVERYWHERE OFF OF THE ORIGIN AND HAS TOTAL MASS ONE I EAST INTEGRATES TO ONE SO THE DELTA FUNCTION ISN'T A FUNCTION IN THE ORDINARY SENSE OF THE WORD BUT IT BEHAVES A LOT LIKE ONE FOR EXAMPLE WE CAN MULTIPLY IT BY A SCALAR INTEGRATE IT ETC SO WE BEND THE RULES A LITTLE AND LET IT INTO THE CLUB SINCE IT MIGHT BE USEFUL TO HAVE AROUND FORMALLY THE DIRAC DELTA FUNCTION IS A MEASURE OR MORE GENERALLY A DISTRIBUTION WE JUST CALL IT A FUNCTION SINCE IT'S CONVENIENT TO THINK OF IT THAT WAY IT HAS ITS OWN WIKIPEDIA PAGE HERE
MANY CALCULATIONS ALSO WOULD GIVE YOU THE SAME IF YOU DID THEM WITH A GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION BUT IT'S JUST SIMPLER TO USE THE DIRAC DELTA
THOUGH I HAVE TO SAY I RAN INTO TROUBLES WITH THAT ONCE
I BELIEVE DELTA FUNCTION SOLELY CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD IN A PHYSICAL WAY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT JUST A DELTA FUNCTION WITHOUT ANYTHING ELSE IT IS A MATHEMATICAL TOOL

SAY YOU NEED TO DESCRIBE CHARGE DENSITY ON A SPACE BUT THE CATCH IS THERE ARE NO CHARGES ANYWHERE ELSE AND ALL THE CHARGES ARE CONCENTRATED AT THE ORIGIN USING DELTA FUNCTION ONE CAN BUILD A FUNCTION WHICH DESCRIBES THIS SITUATION PERFECTLY
FUNCTIONS
I DON'T AGREE WITH SOME OF THE POINTS MADE IN THE ARTICLE FIRST I'LL MAKE IT KNOWN THAT I'M A GRADUATE STUDENT STUDYING CHEMICAL PHYSICS AND I'VE TAKEN 2 QUANTUM MECHANICS CLASSES THEREFORE I'M BY NO MEANS AN EXPERT JUST YET HOWEVER I AM CERTAIN OF THE FOLLOWING THINGS CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG

FIRST THIS SEGMENT BOTHERS ME
THAT MOMENT WHEN PARTICLE PHYSICS MERGE WITH CLASSICAL MECHANICS IS CALLED DECOHERENCE IN TERMS OF PHYSICS IT IS WHEN TIME S DIRECTION BECOMES MATHEMATICALLY IMPORTANT

IT BOTHERS ME BECAUSE EVEN IN QUANTUM MECHANICS YOU HAVE IN THE WAVEFUNCTION FOR SOLUTIONS OF THE SCHRODINGER EQUATION IF YOU KNOW THE STATE OF A PARTICLE AT TIME AND YOU KNOW THE FORM OF THE PROPAGATOR TO ADVANCE ITS STATE TO TIME T THEN YOU HAVE THE SOLUTION TO THE WAVEFUNCTION AT ANY TIME TENSE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE CLASSICAL AT ALL FOR THIS TO HAPPEN

SECOND WHY ARE THEY CLAIMING GRAVITY IS THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND TIME GRAVITY TO ME IS JUST THE EFFECT CAUSED BY THE WARPING OF SPACETIME I GET IT THAT RELATIVITY BRINGS SPACE AND TIME TOGETHER AS ONE ENTITY AMONG OTHER THINGS BUT HOW CAN A PARTICLE BEING TOO SMALL TO FEEL THE EFFECTS OF GRAVITY MEAN THAT IT EXPERIENCES NO TIME BASED ON THE ABOVE POINT THIS IS CLEARLY FALSE BECAUSE WE ALREADY KNOW THERE ARE QUANTUM MECHANICAL SOLUTIONS EVERYWHERE

I GUESS MY MAIN PROBLEM IS THIS SURE WE DON'T KNOW HOW OR WHY TIME GOES IN THE DIRECTION IT DOES BUT THE POINTS THE AUTHOR BRINGS UP TO TRY TO EXPLAIN THE DIRECTION MAKE NO SENSE TO ME I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR OTHER PEOPLE'S THOUGHTS ON THIS
AGREED
I AGREE THAT HUMANS GAVE OLDEN A SCALE
ONE THING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE GREATLY BENEFIT FROM IS FINDING A GOOD A PSYCHOLOGIST THEY CAN TALK TO IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS A QUESTION YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT FOR YOURSELF AND HAVING SOMEONE THERE TO JUST LISTEN TO YOU CAN BE VERY HELPFUL

PERSONALLY I WORK IN AN APPLIED PHYSICS FIELD AND LOVE IT THE ACADEMIC ROUTE CAN BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND OFTEN FAR LESS FULFILLING JUST KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF OPTIONS OUT THERE
TAKING A BREAK FROM PHYSICS WAS WHAT I NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND HOW TRULY PASSIONATE I AM ABOUT IT I WAS UNDER THE ASSUMPTION I DIDN'T WANT TO PUSH MYSELF IN AN ACADEMIC WAY UNTIL I REALIZED HOW MUCH LESS I WANTED TO DO ANYTHING ELSE
ALL YOU HAVE IS A PRB AND ANOTHER PAPER IN THE WORKS AND YOU'VE NOT EVEN STARTED A PHD YET THAT'S PRETTY GOOD ACTUALLY IF YOU'RE THE FIRST AUTHOR

OF COURSE IF YOU DON'T LIKE DOING IT YOU SHOULD NOT CONTINUE
THE GOOD NEWS IS PLENTY OF PHYSICS GUYS END UP IN THE SOFTWARE BUSINESS COME ON OVER THE FINE
SOMETIMES ALL IT TAKES IS A DIFFERENT PROJECT TO RENEW YOUR INTEREST I PERSONALLY HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE IN GRADUATE SCHOOL AND LEFT AT THE MASTERS LEVEL I GOT A GREAT JOB AS A SPACECRAFT CONTROLLER AND I WOULD HAVE STAYED HAD I NOT CHOSEN TO MOVE OVERSEAS NOW I'M IN MY AND I'VE DECIDED TO GO BACK AND GET THAT PHD IN A DIFFERENT AREA OF PHYSICS I'M ENJOYING EVERY MINUTE OF IT A GOOD PROJECT WITH LOTS OF POTENTIAL CAN MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE I'VE COMPLETELY LOST ALL INTEREST IN MY PREVIOUS AREA OF RESEARCH BUT I LOVE WHAT I'M DOING NOW
THE WORD HATE IS THE CLUE THAT YOUR PROBLEM IS NOT PHYSICS
I GET THIS FEELING TO MOSTLY OF SELF DOUBT I ALSO FEEL A BIT ANNOYED AT MYSELF WHEN I'M READING THE TEXTBOOKS FOR EXAMPLE AND THEN I DON'T HAVE THE FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS AS YOU PROGRESS BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO THINK A LOT OF TIMES AND FEEL LIKE I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH IT'S WEIRD I GUESS BUT I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND NOT SURE IF THIS HELPS AND MAY JUST SOUND SILLY BUT I HAVE THE FEELINGS AS I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN HALF THE STUFF IF I WERE ASKED SO YEAH I'M MISSING QUITE A BIT OF KNOWLEDGE TO BUT AT TIMES I'M FINE WITH THAT AS I KNOW THERE'S SO MUCH INFO AND I'LL PROBABLY NEVER GET TO IT EVEN THOUGH I WISH I COULD
ALSO IF YOU NEED A LITTLE INSPIRATION I THINK YOU SHOULD PICK UP A BOOK ABOUT FEYNMAN SURELY YOU'RE JOKING MR FEYNMAN IT'S PRETTY FUN AND QUITE AN INTERESTING TAKE ON PHYSICS BUT MORE SO LIFE AND NOT WORRYING ABOUT THINGS IF YOU HAVE THE TIME GIVE IT A READ KIND OF A WEIRD WAY TO PLUG IT BUT I THINK IT CAN BE SOMEWHAT HELPFUL
THAT'S PERFECTLY FINE JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE AT THE END OF YOUR MASTER'S IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU CAN'T SWITCH DIRECTIONS AFTER WITH A PHYSICS DEGREE YOU'RE ACTUALLY WANTED IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS I WOULD ADVISE JUST FINISHING THE DEGREE AND NOT DROPPING IT AFTERWARDS YOU LOOK WHAT YOU CAN GET FOR EXAMPLE IN BANKS AND OTHER BUSINESSES THEY ARE LOOKING FOR PHYSICISTS ALL THE TIME ALSO IN JOBS THAT DEAL WITH SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT I ACTUALLY SAW OFFERS WHICH EXPLICITLY STATED THEY WERE LOOKING FOR MATHEMATICIANS AND PHYSICISTS THAT NEEDED NO KNOWLEDGE IN PROGRAMMING AT ALL
I'M DOING PHYSICS AS WELL BUT WHEN I WAS DEPRESSED I SURE AS HELL WASN'T GETTING A GRADES I COULDN'T EVEN MANAGE TO DO THE COURSEWORK NOW THAT I BEAT THAT DEPRESSION I HAVE THAT CREATIVITY AND THE DRIVE TO DO MORE THAN WHAT IS SET OUT IN FRONT OF ME I CURRENTLY USE ANY FREE TIME I GET LEARNING NEAT THINGS LIKE HOW TO CODE ELECTRONICS ETC I AIM TO START USING SNIPY TO MODEL THINGS I WANT TO WORK ON AI PROGRAMS AND ROBOTICS AS WELL THESE GOALS WILL TAKE ME QUITE A LOT OF EFFORT AND PATIENCE BUT THEY ARE THINGS MY COURSE WOULD NEVER SHOW ME I ACTUALLY SPEND A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT WAYS I CAN MAKE THINGS BETTER I HAVE ALL OF THESE AMBITIONS THAT WERE VACANT BEFORE AND NOW I'M RETAKING PHYSICS IT IS VERY DIFFERENT

I GUESS MY POINT IS DON'T BE DEPRESSED HAVE YOU TRIED THAT S

WHEN YOU DO BEAT IT THINGS WILL BE BETTER AND LIKE OTHER PEOPLE SUGGESTED ASK FOR HELP I GOT THROUGH IT WITHOUT HELP AND IT TOOK YEARS YOUR TIME IS WORTH IT
I'M CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH A SIMILAR SITUATION I INITIALLY WORKED IN THE FIELD CD FOR MY BACHELOR'S THESIS BUT I DISLIKED THE PEOPLE IN THE GROUP I HAVE BEEN WORKING FURTHER LISTENING TO LECTURES OF ADVANCED QUANTUM FIELD THEORY I COMPLETELY LOST THE INTEREST INTO THE TOPIC SO I SWITCHED THE FIELD FOR MY MASTER'S THESIS THE PEOPLE IN MY NEW GROUP WERE ALL REALLY NICE AND I REALLY ENJOYED THEIR COMPANY MY PROJECT PARTICULARLY DEALT WITH THE STUDY OF NEUTRINO REACTIONS BUT WAS PART OF A HIGHLY INTERDISCIPLINARY SUBFIELD OF PHYSICS SO MY COWORKERS ONLY HAD A BARE CLUE ABOUT WHAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON AND SO DID I ABOUT THEIR WORK I SEARCHED GUIDANCE FROM MY PROFESSOR BUT HE WAS RATHER ACTING AS A MANAGER BETWEEN THE TOPICS THE STUDENTS HAVE BEEN WORKING ON HAVING A BRILLIANT CLUE ABOUT HOW THE DIFFERENT FIELDS HIS STUDENTS ARE WORKING ON ARE CONNECTED AND WHAT MIGHT BE FUTURE TOPICS TO INVESTIGATE BUT LACKING TO VARYING DEGREE OF MORE DETAILED KNOWLEDGE SO I ENDED UP WORKING ON A PROJECT WITH BARE MENTORSHIP ALTHOUGH I DID A GREAT JOB AT IT I COMPLETELY LOST MY MIND DOING SO I ENDED UP DECLINING THE OFFER FOR A PHD POSITION AND I'M NOW DOING A SABBATICAL I STILL FEEL A GREAT PASSION FOR SCIENCE IN MYSELF BUT HAVE PROBLEMS FIGURING OUT WHETHER OR NOT I CAN ABANDON THIS PASSION OR INTEGRATE IT DIFFERENTLY INTO MY FUTURE LIFE SO I'M SORRY THAT I REALLY CAN'T GIVE YOU ANY ADVICE ON HOW TO HANDLE YOUR CURRENT SITUATION BUT AT LEAST I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT YOU ARE NOT ALONE
YOU HAVE TO ASK YOU WHY YOU START IN THE FIRST PLACE WITH PHYSICS ALSO WHY YOU CHOOSE SOLID STATE PHYSICS I HATED IT TO FROM MY FIRST COURSE IN IT THEN I BEGUN RESEARCHING ON MY OWN WILL SOME THINGS NOW I WILL GO AND TAKE A COURSE IN IT SIMPLY BECAUSE I FELT I NEED TO KNOW SOMETHING IN THAT DIRECTION

WELL IS THERE NOBODY YOU CAN TALK TO LIKE OTHER STUDY BUDDIES PEOPLE IN THE DEPARTMENT WHOEVER COULD GIVE A NEW PERSPECTIVE

IN THE END YOU HAVE TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS ON YOUR OWN AND IF YOU SHOULD CONTINUE
I KNEW I HATED PHYSICS BY THE END OF MY SECOND YEAR BUT BY THEN I DIDN'T WANT TO SETBACK MYSELF BY 2 YEARS TO START A NEW DEGREE I WORKED SUPER HARD IN MY MASTERS YEAR TO PULL MY OVERALL GRADES UP I LOOKED FOR WHAT IT WAS THAT I DID ENJOY IN THE DEGREE PROGRAMMING PROBLEM SOLVING I ENDED UP TAKING AN ENGINEERING POSITION WORKING IN SOFTWARE SUPPORT NOT EVEN A JOB I WANTED JUST THE FIRST INTERVIEW HAPPENED TO SAY YES TO ME EVENTUALLY THROUGH FOLLOWING WHAT I ENJOY I MOVED INTO ENGINEERING SALES AND NOW SALES MANAGEMENT


THE COOL THING WITH A PHYSICS DEGREE IS IT TEACHES YOU A LARGE AMOUNT OF TRANSFERABLE SKILLS TO GO FOR PRETTY MUCH ANY JOB MATHEMATICS PROBLEM SOLVING CRITICAL THINKING TECHNICAL WRITING PROGRAMMING DATA ANALYSIS MODELING PRESENTING ON RESULTS AND COMMUNICATING TECHNICAL CONCEPTS THINK ABOUT THINGS YOU ENJOY AND LOOK FOR A JOB WHERE YOU CAN DO IT AND LEVERAGE YOUR SKILLS YOU EARNED AT UNI
TRUTH IS I PLOWED THROUGH A PHD WITHOUT BEING AS TRULY PASSIONATE ABOUT IT AS MANY PEOPLE ARE IT WORKED OUT FINE BUT IN HINDSIGHT WOULD I HAVE SACRIFICED MY WORKING REALLY HARD FOR NO MONEY PROBABLY NOT

ANYWAY MY ADVICE IS DON'T BE ONE OF THOSE STRANGE PEOPLE WHO ARE ONE CLASS SHORT OF FINISHING PUT YOUR HEAD DOWN FINISH THE MASTER'S AND THEN REEVALUATE THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO GET ON PAPER WHAT YOU'VE DONE WHILE GIVING YOURSELF A CHANCE TO PIVOT

ALSO ANOTHER THING THAT HELPED ME IS MAKING FRIENDS OUTSIDE OF PHYSICS YOU NEED TO GET AWAY FROM IT IN YOUR FREE TIME
I STARTED DEVELOPING SIGNIFICANT ISSUES WITH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION IN THE FINAL YEAR OF UNDERGRADUATE NOT REALLY RECOGNIZING THAT'S WHAT WAS HAPPENING I HAD SIGNIFICANT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WHEN I FIRST ENTERED GRADUATE SCHOOL FOR PHYSICS I HAD EPISODES OF PANIC ATTACKS SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND EVEN SUSPECTED MANIA THOUGH I'M STILL SKEPTICAL OF THIS ONE A PSYCHOLOGIST I SAW IS CONVINCED I LEFT THE FIRST PHD PROGRAM WITH A MASTERS AND TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER TO TRY AND ALLEVIATE THE ISSUES VIA ENVIRONMENT AND WORK PLACE RELATIONS BUT ALL THEY DID WAS COME BACK THAT WAS IMPORTANT DATA AFTER I REALIZED THIS I REALIZED THE PROBLEM WAS MYSELF NOT THE RESEARCH FIELD OR MY PROCESS OF ELIMINATION WITH THE SELF HURTS

I DECIDED TO MAKE MYSELF AND MY HEALTH MY RESEARCH PROJECT FOR AWHILE I BECAME OBSESSED WITH IT TO A POINT THAT MY DOCTORS ALMOST CONSIDERED IT AS PART OF MY PATHOLOGY I READ ABOUT PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY TO TRY AN ALLAY MY INITIAL SKEPTICISM OF THEM AS SCIENCE THEY ARE SCIENCE TOO BY THE WAY THEY JUST HAVE LESS EXPERIMENTAL POWER BY DESIGN VERY FRUSTRATING BUT SO IT GOES I LOOKED INTO DOCTORS AND LEARNED ABOUT HEALTH INSURANCE I STARTED TRYING TO BE MORE SELF AWARE OF MYSELF AND MY HEALTH AND BELIEVE ME YOU IT WAS NOT EASY AND IT WAS A VERY VERY SLOW PROCESS IT WAS MADE SLOWER BY THE FACT THAT I WAS TAKING CLASSES AND TEACHING AND DOING RESEARCH AND DOING QUALIFIERS ALL AT THE SAME TIME BUT IN HINDSIGHT I STILL MANAGED TO LEARN A LOT OF PHYSICS WHILE LEARNING ABOUT MYSELF YOU OFTEN DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW UNTIL YOU USE WHAT YOU KNOW FAR AFTER THE POINT WHERE YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE TOPIC ENOUGH FOR THE FINAL PROBLEM SETS YIELDING A SYMPATHY B FROM YOUR GRADUATE COURSE PROFESSORS DEFLATING YES BUT I STUBBORNLY HELD ON

AFTER TWO THERAPISTS TWO PSYCHIATRISTS A COACH WHO WAS FAMILIAR WITH WORKING WHILE COPING WITH ANALOGOUS ISSUES THREE SEASONS OF BOOTJACK HORSEMAN TWO YEARS IN ONE PROGRAM FLOUNDERING TWO YEARS FLOUNDERING IN ANOTHER TWO YEARS OF STUBBORNLY PURSUING A MENTAL STATE THAT IS BOTH PRODUCTIVE AND HEALTHY AND WAY WAY TOO MANY COPALS AND MEDICAL BILLS I FINALLY FIGURED OUT WHAT I NEEDED TO TICK PROPERLY I SOLVED THE PROBLEM THAT WAS MYSELF AND MY HEAD OVER THE PAST TWO MOST RECENT YEARS MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE IS SLOWLY BEING PUT BACK TOGETHER AND PHYSICS HAS ACTUALLY BECOME GRATIFYING AGAIN I NOW AM CERTAIN I CAN FINISH MY PHD IN GOOD GRACES AND MAYBE EVEN DO A SOLID POST DOC BEFORE ENTERING THE PROFESSIONAL WORLD I CAN SAY FOR CERTAIN THAT TWO YEARS AGO I WOULD NEVER HAVE GUESSED EVER FEELING THAT WAY

NO ONE HERE IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO TELL YOU IF PHYSICS IS FOR YOU OR NOT IN ANY CAPACITY BUT WHAT I CAN TELL YOU FROM MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IS THIS MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES CAN ATTACK EVERYTHING IN YOUR LIFE EVEN THE THINGS YOU'RE MOST PASSIONATE ABOUT AND THEY ARE VERY CAPABLE OF MAKING YOU FEEL NOT LIKE YOU LEFT UNCHECKED THEY WILL CHANGE YOU TO THE CORE AND LEAVE YOU AS SOMEONE YOU FIND IMPOSSIBLE TO RECOGNIZE IN THE MIRROR BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO PHYSICS WHICH YOU CLEARLY LOVE OR WOULD NOT BE BOTHERING POSTING HERE YOU SHOULD TRY VERY VERY HARD TO SOLVE THE MOST IMPORTANT PHYSICS PROBLEM YOU HAVE IN YOUR LIFE NOW YOURSELF AND YOUR HEAD AND HOW TO COPE WITH THE EMOTIONAL ROLLERCOASTER THAT IS ACADEMIA THAT CAN REDUCE EVEN THE HEALTHIEST OF US TO ANXIOUS DEPRESSED WRECKS AT TIMES

GOOD LUCK OUT THERE
I'M STARTING MY MASTER'S IN PHYSICS IN THE AREA OF COMPUTATIONAL ELECTROMAGNETICS SOMETIMES I GET FRUSTRATED WITH THE THEORETICAL SIDE AS IT SEEMS MOST OF MY WORK WHICH LEADS ANYWHERE IS JUST REPLICATION SOMEONE ELSE BEAT ME TO IT AND DID A BETTER JOB BUT THEN I DIG INTO THE PROGRAMMING SIDE BUILDING TOOLS AND SIMULATIONS GETTING IMMEDIATE RESULTS AND ENJOYING THE DESIGN ASPECT AND BEFORE TOO LONG I'M BORED OUT OF MY MIND AND COME BACK TO THE PHYSICS WITH ENTHUSIASM MAYBE A BIT OF A BREAK WILL REAWAKEN YOUR PASSION DO SOMETHING RADICALLY DIFFERENT WHICH INTERESTS YOU BUT DON'T CLOSE ANY DOORS IF YOU LOVE PHYSICS AFTER ALL YOU'LL COME BACK IF YOU DON'T YOU SHOULDN'T
WISH I COULD GET STRAIGHT AS WITHOUT TRYING
I RECOGNIZE THAT THIS MAY NOT MEAN MUCH COMING FROM AN UNDERGRAD BUT IT MAY HELP IF YOU TAKE THE TIME TO DELVE INTO SOME INTERESTING LINKS TO PHYSICS RATHER THAN JUST PHYSICS ITSELF MAYBE TAKE A LOOK AT MATERIALS SCIENCE SINCE YOU ARE ALREADY DOING SOLID STATE OR MAYBE LOOK AT SOME CHEMISTRY OR BIOLOGY IT HELPS MAKE THINGS REALLY COOL AGAIN WHEN YOU SEE HOW THE LITTLE NITPICKY PHYSICS TURNS OUT ON THE LARGE SCALE IT WORKED FOR ME AT LEAST
DID YOU GO TO FSU FOR MECHATRONICS
I DECIDED TO BECOME A TECHNICIAN AFTER GETTING MY ASCI NEARLY EVERYONE ELSE WENT OFF TO DO A PHD
ABSOLUTELY DO NOT REGRET IT ONE BIT I JUST DID NOT HAVE THE PASSION TO DO RESEARCH IN ONE SMALL FIELD SO IT'D HAVE BEEN A WASTE OF MY TIME MY SUPERVISOR'S TIME THE DEPARTMENT'S FUNDING AND A PLACE THAT SOMEONE ELSE COULD HAVE TAKEN

YOU ABSOLUTELY DON'T NEED TO STAY IN ACADEMIA OR EVEN IN THE PHYSICS FIELD
FELT THE SAME WAY MY ENTIRE TIME AT UCSB SOME OF THE WORST YEARS OF MY LIFE WERE SPENT THERE
AS A PERSON OF DEDUCTION WHAT DO YOU WANT
HEY SO I HAD SIMILAR PROBLEM WITH DEPRESSION AND IN THE SECOND YEAR I ALMOST DROPPED PHYSICS HOWEVER IN THE THIRD YEAR I ASKED ONE OF MY PROF IF I CAN WORK IN HIS DEPARTMENT HE SAID YES AND IT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF MY BEST DECISIONS BECAUSE I ACTUALLY USED THE THINGS I'VE BEEN STUDYING LIKE CRAZY LONG STORY SHORT DUE TO THE VALUABLE EXPERIENCE IN MY FIELD THAT I HAD AT THE TIME OF THE GRADUATION I GOT A REALLY COOL JOB IN ONE OF THE LARGEST INTERNATIONAL PROJECTS NOW I WOULDN'T CHANGE A THING AND I AM GLAD THAT I STAYED IN PHYSICS
I'M SERIOUSLY THINKING ABOUT QUITTING PHYSICS FOR GOOD I'M DOING DATA ANALYSIS IN PARTICLE PHYSICS ON CMS DATA AND SEEING HOW MY SUPERVISOR AND HIS PULL HOURS A WEEK JUST TO GET AN ANNUAL PAPER OUT DOESN'T LOOK VERY REWARDING EVEN IF THEY'D GIVE A GOLD POT IT'S NOW ESPECIALLY EXHAUSTING B C I HAVE TO COMPLETE SOME OF THE UNI COURSES AND STILL WANT TO MAINTAIN MY GA AND THE TASKS IN PARTICLE PHYSICS DON'T GIVE A FUCK WHAT TIME IT IS THEY MUST BE COMPLETED ASAP

I PROBABLY START LOOKING FOR A JOB NEXT SEMESTER POSSIBLY A SOFTWARE DEV GIG SINCE I HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE IN THAT FIELD ALREADY AT LEAST IN PRIVATE SECTOR I DON'T HAVE TO BRING WORK TO HOME AS I DO RIGHT NOW AND THE PAY IS HIGHER AND STABLE

WHELP BACK TO WORK I GUESS

NINJA EDIT I'M COMPLETING MY MASTERS AS WELL
THIS RESONATES SO STRONGLY WITH ME A FEW YEARS AGO I WENT THROUGH SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR DURING MY MASTERS DEGREE I FOUND IT PERSONALLY DIFFICULT TO STUDY WHEN I DISLIKED PHYSICS BEST THING TO DO AS OTHERS IS SAID IS TO TALK TO SOMEONE IT BECOMES SO MUCH EASIER WHEN YOU TALK TO SOMEONE YOU MIGHT FIND THIS HELPS BRING BACK THE LOVE OF STUDYING A SUBJECT THANKFULLY IT DID FOR ME
I WAS STUDYING PHYSICS IN ONE OF THE BEST IF NOT THE BEST UNIVERSITY HERE I LOVED THE SUBJECT AND WHEN I WAS AT HIGHSCHOOL I KNEW I WANTED TO BECAME A PHYSICIST IN MY 5TH SEMESTER I WAS SO TIRED SO BORED OF PHYSICS SHORT STORY I QUIT I STARTED STUDYING COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ONE YEAR LATER I REALIZED HOW MUCH I LOVE PHYSICS I CAME BACK TO MY OLD SCHOOL AND WAS REALLY COOL
I THINK YOU JUST NEED A BREAK
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH I'M FINISHING MY MASTERS THIS YEAR AND CANNOT WAIT TO START PHD I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH PHYSICS AND REALLY DON'T WANT TO STOP DOING IT ANY TIME SOON SO IF YOU'RE FEELING THIS WAY PERHAPS YOUR MIND IS ALREADY MADE UP
HEY MAN I'M IN THE SAME BOAT EXCEPT I'M A BIT YOUNGER AND I HAPPEN TO LIKE PHYSICS

SUFFERING TOGETHER IS ALWAYS BETTER THAN SUFFERING ALONE PM ME
WELL I'M NOT AS FAR AS YOU ARE BUT AS SOMEONE WHO HAS HAD EPILEPSY DEPRESSION AND SOCIAL ANXIETY HIS WHOLE LIFE I CAN AT LEAST SYMPATHIZE SOME I WAS PUSHED AWAY FROM ENGINEERING TOO AND IT WAS ALSO BECAUSE OF SOME THOUGHTS

THE ONLY THINGS IN YOUR POST THAT DIFFER FROM MY EXPERIENCE ARE THAT YOU'RE FURTHER ALONG THAN ME AND THAT YOU HAVEN'T DISCOVERED ANY COOL INTERESTING THINGS TO FASCINATE YOURSELF WITH I'VE BEEN OBSESSED WITH PHYSICS SINCE I WAS LIKE DDK FIVE OR SOMETHING RIGHT NOW MY OBSESSION IS QUANTUM GRAVITY AND THE DREAM IS TO FIGURE IT OUT SO WE CAN START MANIPULATING GRAVITY JUST FOR SAKE AND BECAUSE SPACE TRAVEL

HONESTLY THOUGH I THINK EPILEPSY HELPED ME MORE WITH MY FASCINATION WITH PHYSICS THAN ANYTHING ELSE DDK WHY BUT EVERY TIME I HAVE A SEIZURE I CAN'T HELP BUT SHOVE MY FACE INTO SOME PHYSICS READING IT'S LIKE A COMPULSION THAT TAKES OVER ME LOL NOW THAT THEY'RE MORE UNDER CONTROL TWO YEARS SEIZURE FREE AS OF EXACTLY ONE WEEK AGO IT'S LESS OF A COMPULSION TO DO THE STUFF AND IT IS NOT HELPING WITH MOTIVATION BUT I AM DEFINITELY MORE CLEAR HEADED AND ACTUALLY ABLE TO HANDLE THE CONTENTION IT'S LIKE THE SEIZURES MAKE THE ABSTRACT THINKING EASIER FOR GRASPING THE STUFF

WHICH LEADS ME TO SOME MAYBE SUGGESTIONS READ SOME NONFICTION STUFF ABOUT THE HISTORY OF PHYSICS GO OUT IN NATURE FOR LONG HIKES THERE'S NO BETTER WAY TO GROW AN APPRECIATION FOR PHYSICS THAN TO SEE IT IN ACTION OUTSIDE THE LABORATORY TAKE THE FIRST WILD IDEA ABOUT THE UNIVERSE YOU HAVE AND FILL A WHITEBEARD WITH IT MATH DRAWINGS OR WHATEVER DO SOME EXPLORATIONS OF PHYSICS AND EVENTUALLY MAYBE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO PUT YOUR SIGHTS ON SOMETHING LONG-TERM THAT WILL LET YOU DRAG YOURSELF THROUGH THE BS OF ACADEMIA TILL YOU CAN DO THAT ONE THING OR JUST QUIT AND BECOME AN ARTIST APPARENTLY WE EPILEPTICS HAVE A KNACK FOR ABSTRACT CREATIVITY
THIS COMMENT HAS BEEN OVERWRITTEN
MAN I HATE SOLID STATE PHYSICS TOO PARTICLE PHYSICS ON THE CONTRARY IS A VERY COOL AND SATISFYING SUBJECT

EDIT WTF SO MUCH SOLID STATE PHYSICIANS HERE
DELETED
YOU MIGHT WANT TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE WEEKLY CAREERS EDUCATION THREAD

A PHYSICIST CAN DO A VARIETY OF JOBS IN THE INDUSTRY AND WHEN PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY WENT CORPORATE FOR BETTER PAY AND HOURS THEY USUALLY MEAN THAT THEY'RE NO LONGER DOING PHYSICS PER SE BUT INDEED WORKING AS SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS OR THE LIKE

A LOT OF THE JOBS OUT THERE CAN BE QUITE TECHNICAL WHERE HAVING A RELATIVELY MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND SUCH AS A PHD IN PHYSICS CAN BE HELPFUL ON THE JOB AND SOMETIMES EVEN A REQUIREMENT TO PASS CV SCREENING A DEGREE IN PHYSICS IS AND IS SEEN AS ONE GIVING A GOOD OVERVIEW OF A LOT OF THINGS AND AS PROOF ONE CAN SOLVE TECHNICAL PROBLEMS THAT'S WHY IF YOU'RE NOT SURE WHO TO HIRE YOU MIGHT GO FOR A PHYSICIST AS THE FIELD BECOMES MORE STANDARDIZED SPECIFIC DEGREES WILL OFTEN BE CRAFTED LIKE WHAT HAPPENED IN MACHINE LEARNING DATA SCIENCE AND FINANCIAL ENGINEERING

SOME OF THE MORE TECHNICAL JOBS REMAIN CLOSE TO ACADEMIA IN THAT YOU WILL BE READING ARTICLES AND MAYBE EVEN PUBLISHING TYPICALLY THOUGH WHAT'S DIFFERENT BETWEEN ACADEMIA AND RHE INDUSTRY IS THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE METHODOLOGY YOU OFTEN WANT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE TRUSTED TO BE AUTOMATED RATHER THAN THE FANCIEST WAY OF DOING THINGS WHERE YOU SOMETIMES NEED TO GUIDE THINGS BY HAND TO GET BEST POSSIBLE FIT TO SOME EXPERIMENTAL DATA THIS MEANS THAT ONE TENDS TO BUILD ON WHAT EXISTS EVEN MORE IN THE INDUSTRY INSTEAD OF DOING SOMETHING COMPLETELY NEW FROM SCRATCH

OBVIOUSLY MANY PHYSICISTS OPT FOR THE LESS TECHNICAL JOBS OR ONES THAT DON'T REALLY UTILIZE ANY OF THEIR TRAINING EXCEPT GENERAL PROBLEM SOLVING

GENERALIZATIONS ARE DIFFICULT TO MAKE HERE AND YOU SHOULD IDEALLY BE ASKING YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT SOME MORE SPECIFIC JOB
I AM A PHD PHYSICIST WHO WENT STRAIGHT FROM GRAD SCHOOL TO AN INDUSTRY JOB I DID IT FOR ACCESS TO BETTER PROBLEMS THE ACADEMIC RESEARCH I DID IN SCHOOL WAS VERY CHALLENGING AND REWARDING BUT ALSO VERY ESOTERIC THROUGH CONFERENCES AND WORKSHOPS I KNEW PERSONALLY ALL PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THAT CARED ABOUT THE WORK I WAS DOING I KNEW THERE HAD TO BE BETTER WAY OF PICKING PROBLEMS TO WORK ON

I THINK THERE IS FAR TOO MUCH FOCUS ON THE FREEDOM TO CHOOSE YOUR RESEARCH SUBJECT MOST ACADEMIC RESEARCH IS SO SPECIFIC AND NARROW THAT YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY HAVE HAD A BURNING DESIRE TO MAKE THAT PARTICULAR MEASUREMENT BEFORE YOU STARTED MOSTLY THE FREEDOM TO CHOOSE IS A MYTH ANYWAY AS IT IS HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY BUDGET ABILITY TO PUBLISH AND MANY OTHER FACTORS OUT OF YOUR CONTROL

THE GREATER JOY IS IN THE FREEDOM TO CHOOSE HOW TO SOLVE PROBLEMS OF VALUE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SCIENCE THE SHIT OUT OF A PROBLEM THAT S OR MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WILL BENEFIT FROM IS A LOT OF FUN KNOWING THAT THE PROBLEM HAS VALUE IS IMPORTANT AND PEOPLE WILL LET YOU KNOW THIS BY GIVING YOU MONEY FOR THE SOLUTION PRODUCT

TO YOUR ACTUAL QUESTION THOUGH I MAKE PRODUCTS JUST LIKE AN ENGINEER BUT WITH A LOT MORE PHYSICS I HAVE MADE INSTRUMENTATION SENSORS AND NOW DOMESTIC APPLIANCES PHYSICS IS IN ALL OF THESE THINGS AND LEARNING HOW IT APPLIES TO THEM IS THE REAL JOY

THE FACT THAT I MAKE TWICE AS MUCH MONEY AS A UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR IS NICE TOO
THERE ARE SOME PRIVATE CORPORATIONS ESPECIALLY DOD CONTRACTORS THAT DO BASIC RESEARCH IF YOU MANAGE TO SNAG A JOB AT ONE OF THESE PLACES THEY WILL HIRE YOU TO SIMPLY PERFORM EXPERIMENTS AND PUBLISH IN YOUR FIELD JUST LIKE AN ACADEMIC ULTIMATELY THE GOAL IS TO PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH FUTURE ASSETS AND KEEP THEM COMPETITIVE FOR THE MOST PART HOWEVER YOU ARE FREE TO EXPLORE IDEAS WHICH YOU FIND EXCITING AND NOVEL
THERE ARE GREAT ANSWERS ABOVE I WILL ADD THAT EVEN AT NATIONAL LABS AND UNIVERSITIES THERE ARE JOBS FOR PHYSICISTS THE ADVANCED PHOTON SOURCE APS AT ARGONNE NATIONAL LAB EMPLOYS MANY PHYSICISTS TO WORK ON THE BEAM LINE OTHER EXAMPLES WOULD BE AT AIF AT LLNL OR THEY HAVE LASER SCIENTISTS AS WELL NOT ALL REQUIRE PH D'S SO I THOUGHT I'D MENTION IT IN CASE AN UNDERGRAD OR GRAD STUDENT IS UNAWARE OF THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE AFTER GRADUATION
INDUSTRY IS SUCH A CATCH-ALL GENERAL TERM FOR NON-GOVERNMENT WORK IT'S NOT REALLY USEFUL BECAUSE AS YOU SAID IT CAN RANGE FROM SOFTWARE ENGINEERING TO ACTUAL RESEARCH

THERE ARE SOME PRIVATE COMPANIES THAT JUST DO RESEARCH WORK FOR EXAMPLE IN MY FIELD YOU HAVE GENERAL FUSION AND TRI ALPHA ENERGY WHO HAVE INDUSTRY SCIENTISTS DOING RESEARCH AND AS A IN MY FIELD YOU CAN ALSO HAVE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING LIKE THE PLASMA PACKAGES FOR CONSOL
THE WAY I SEE IT IF YOU'RE A PHYSICIST THEN YOUR JOB IS TO BE SMART THEY'RE GOING TO PUT YOU TO WORK ON SOME PROBLEM WHERE THERE ISN'T A TRADITIONAL JOB THAT HANDLES IT BECAUSE IT'S AN UNUSUAL PROBLEM AND YOU JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION FROM BIOGRAPHY HE WORKED AS HEAD CHEMIST FOR A PLASTIC PLATING COMPANY WITH NO PRIOR EXPERIENCE IN THAT FIELD OF WORK EITHER HIS APPROACH WAS JUST TO TRY A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT STUFF TO SEE WHAT WORKS AND THEN GO FROM THERE HE WORKED ON THE MANHATTAN PROJECT ON THE INVESTIGATION FOR THE CHALLENGER EXPLOSION AT HIS SON'S COMPANY IN I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT YOU GET MY POINT
FOR MY PART I USED MY EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN MODELING DATA ALONG WITH SOME RIGOROUS ADDITIONAL TO MAKE A TRANSITION INTO THE INDUSTRY OF DATA SCIENCE

IT'S A VERY WELL-PAID INTELLECTUALLY REWARDING CAREER AND MANY OF THE SKILLETS YOU USE IN PHYSICS ANALYSIS ARE USEFUL STATISTICS PROBABILITY THEORY STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND SO ON MANY THEORETICAL DISCOVERIES IN PHYSICS ARE NOW APPLIED TOWARDS THE REALM OF MACHINE LEARNING AND STATISTICAL INFERENCE FOR BUSINESSES AND DID I MENTION IT WAS WELL-PAID YOUR STARTING SALARY WILL ALREADY BE COMPETITIVE WITH MOST PHYSICS PROFESSORS AND IT ONLY GOES UP FROM THERE
THERE IS ALSO THE FIELD OF GEOPHYSICS I'VE KNOWN MANY OF THEM OVER THE YEARS WHO WORKED IN THE OIL GAS INDUSTRY DOING D SEISMIC WORK OTHERS CAREER POSSIBILITIES SUCH AS EARTHQUAKE SCIENCE ETC ARE INDICATED IN THE WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE I BELIEVE THAT DEGREE PROGRAM IS COMMONLY THROUGH A SEPARATE GEOPHYSICS DEPARTMENT OR PERHAPS A COMBINED GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS OR EARTH SCIENCES DEPARTMENT THOUGH I HAVE HEARD OF THOSE HAVING A TRADITIONAL PHYSICS DEGREE WITH A MINOR IN GEOLOGY WORKING AS GEOPHYSICISTS

I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CURRENT JOB MARKET IS FOR THEM

IF OF INTEREST HERE ARE A COUPLE REDDIN LINKS

THOUGHTS ON A CAREER IN GEOPHYSICS

WHAT IS GEOPHYSICS AND HOW DO I GET INTO IT

GEOPHYSICS SUBREDDIT

I'D LIKE TO MENTION ONE OTHER WORK POSSIBILITY FOR PHYSICISTS ANYONE IN STEM ACTUALLY ADMITTEDLY IT MIGHT APPEAL ONLY TO A SMALL SUBSET OF PHYSICS MAJORS BUT MY EXPERIENCE IN INDUSTRY IS THAT IT'S A MUCH SOUGHT-AFTER COMBINATION THAT IS TO COMBINE A BS IN PHYSICS OR STEM WITH AN MBA MANY COMPANIES LOVE THE COMBINATION OF A TECHNICAL DEGREE WITH AN MBA ONCE YOU'RE IN THE COMPANY THEY'LL ASSUME YOU'RE SMART ENOUGH TO DO ANYTHING AND THEY'LL LIKELY WANT TO GROOM YOU FOR HIGHER LEVEL JOBS INCLUDING MANAGEMENT JOBS THEY'LL LOOK FOR INTERPERSONAL AND LEADERSHIP TYPE SKILLS THIS IS A NICHE AREA REALLY BUT I'VE KNOWN SO MANY STEM GRADS GOING IN THIS DIRECTION AND THEIR FEEDBACK HAS BEEN GENERALLY POSITIVE MOST I'VE KNOWN GET A JOB FIRST THEN GO FOR THE MBA AT NIGHT OFTEN WITH TUITION SUPPORT FROM THE COMPANY OR TAKE AN EDUCATIONAL LEAVE OF ABSENCE FREQUENTLY GRANTED IF THIS AT ALL APPEALS TO YOU AS AN UNDERGRAD GOING FOR JUST A BS I'D SUGGEST DISCUSSING THAT ROUTE WHEN INTERVIEWING FOR A JOB MY EXPERIENCE WITH THIS IS LIMITED TO THE USA I ASSUME THIS IS COMMON WORLDWIDE BUT I HAVE LIMITED EXPERIENCE WITH THAT MAYBE SOMEONE COULD COMMENT
MY EXPERIENCE IS WORKING WITH COMPUTATIONAL ENGINEERS TO HELP THEM BETTER UNDERSTAND THE PHYSICS THEY SIMULATE TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE MOST PHYSICISTS ARE USED FOR THEIR PROBLEM SOLVING ABILITY
I ENDED UP DOING BIOANALYTICS AND DOING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF ASSAYS AND WHAT NOT FOR THAT IT'S NOT PURE PHYSICS BUT IT'S STILL THE PART ABOUT SCIENCE I LOVE DOING IMMOV I
THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF FINANCE JOBS FOR PHYSICISTS WHICH MAKES SENSE BECAUSE ALMOST EVERY MODEL IN FINANCE IS A PHYSICS EQUATION ORIGINALLY HEAT EQUATION FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE SOME NEW FIELDS LIKE ECONOPHYSICS WHICH ARE HEAVILY SIMULATION BASED TOO
IN MY COUNTRY A LOT OF PHYSICISTS END UP IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING BECAUSE IT PAYS GOOD THERE IS NOT A LOT OF SCIENCE SW HERE BUT APPS BUSINESS SOFTWARE OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO KNOW SOME C CPP OR JAVA BEFOREHAND
TRACKING AS SIMPLE AS THAT IT IS NOT HARD TO GET LOW GAIN FOR RF BUT FOR OPTICAL YOU NEED PRECISION TRACKING AND ALIGNMENT

WITH HIGH POWER LOW EARTH ORBIT AN RF LINK IS TRIVIAL TO ACHIEVE BUT TRY ALIGNING A LASER AND PHOTODIODE WITH AN OBJECT IN FAST ORBIT IS BASICALLY IMPOSSIBLE
IS THERE ANY REASON OPTICAL LINKS CAN'T BE USED BETWEEN SATELLITES AND GROUND STATIONS

YES THERE IS CLOUDS THERMAL DISTURBANCES IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND SMOG

IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THE ATMOSPHERIC ABSORPTION AT OPTICAL AND RF FREQUENCIES IS THAT DIFFERENT

THERE IS A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MICROWAVE AND OPTICAL TRANSMISSION THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE
I THINK REFRACTION IS QUITE A BIGGER CONCERN FOR OPTICAL IN ATMOSPHERE THAN ABSORPTION STARS TWINKLE AND ALL THAT
ARBITRARY THE POINT IS THAT THE TRUE GROUND STATE ENERGY IS THE LOWEST POSSIBLE ANSWER BUT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT TO CALCULATE YOU SUBSTITUTE A TRIAL FAMILY OF FUNCTIONS WHICH ARE EASY TO CALCULATE FIND THE LOWEST ENERGY THAT FAMILY CAN GENERATE AND HOPE IT'S A GOOD APPROXIMATION MORE FLEXIBILITY I EAST MORE PARAMETERS MAKES IT MORE LIKELY THAT YOU CAN BETTER APPROXIMATE THE TRUE WAVEFUNCTION BUT ALSO MEANS MORE WORK SO THERE'S A TRADEOFF WHEN TRYING TO CALCULATE EFFICIENTLY
YOU CAN USE AS MANY AS YOU WANT
HI I USED BOTH OF THESE BOOKS THE WALKER VERSION IS MUCH NEWER IT'S TWICE AS HEAVY BECAUSE IT'S FULL OF COLORFUL PICTURES OF LIKE ROLLER COASTERS AND SURFERS BUT IT HAS THE EXACT SAME MATERIAL I THOUGHT THE KRANE BOOK WAS MUCH MORE
ONE OF THE TEXTBOOKS IS THE FIFTH EDITION THE OTHER IS THE TENTH EDITION TO ME THAT WOULD SEEM MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE THREE AUTHORS HAS CHANGED

IS ANY ONE VERSION BETTER THAN THE OTHER

IF ONE ACCEPTS THE PREMISE THAT NEWER EDITIONS HAVE MORE ERRORS FIXED OR ARE MORE UP-TO-DATE WITH EVENTS IN PHYSICS THEN THE NEWER BOOK WOULD BE A BETTER CHOICE
YOU ARE NOT WRONG I THINK THAT FOCUSING ON METRICS EAST G NUMBER OF PAPERS BOOKS PLENARY TALKS ETC WILL ALWAYS PROMOTE GAMING THE SYSTEM THOSE BEST AT THE GAME WIN STEADY CAREER PATHS THOUGH THEY MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST GOOD RESEARCHERS GET THROUGH THE SYSTEM TOO THOUGH GRANT WRITING IS MORE OF A BLACK ARTICLE SUCCESS IS QUITE GOOD KNOWING SOMEONE AT THE FUNDING AGENCY CAN MAKE THIS MUCH HIGHER METRICS RUIN THE FUNDING PROCESS IN SOME WAYS BECAUSE THERE IS MORE FOCUS ON DELIVERABLES THAN BREAKTHROUGHS HOW MANY GAME CHANGING IDEAS HAVE BEEN SHELVED DUE TO IMPENDING DEADLINES IT'S A TOUGH GAME AND CAN SEE WHY IT'S NOT APPEALING TO YOU THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS HONESTLY STILL AND HAVE GREAT IDEAS GOOD LUCK
I HAVE RECENTLY BEEN TROUBLED BY THIS I AM CURRENTLY AN WORKING ON MY UNDERGRAD AND I HAD HOPES OF GETTING A PHD AND DOING RESEARCH AS A CAREER HOWEVER I HAVE RECENTLY MET A PROFESSOR WHO DESCRIBED WHAT YOU JUST SAID THAT THE FIELD OF RESEARCH IS HIGHLY POLITICAL UNPRODUCTIVE AND UNSCIENTIFIC IT HAS SOMEWHAT TURNED ME OFF TO BECOMING A RESEARCHER AS I HAD THOUGHT BEFORE THAT FUNDING WAS PROVIDED FOR THE BEST QUALITY OF RESEARCH NOT TO THE MOST PUBLISHED OR THE MOST EFFECTIVE RESEARCH

ALL I WANT IS TO DO GOOD HIGH QUALITY RESEARCH I WANT TO DOCUMENT POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO UNKNOWNS WHILE BEING HONEST WITH THE CONCLUSIVENESS OF MY RESULTS

IS THIS JUST A PIPE DREAM WOULD I BE BETTER OFF BECOMING AN ENGINEER AND TRYING TO FIND A JOB DOING CORPORATE RESEARCH I HAVE A DEEP PASSION FOR THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES AND AM WILLING TO WORK AS HARD AS IT TAKES I JUST DON'T WANT TO GET TO THE END OF THE ROAD ONLY TO FIND I HAVE TAKEN THE WRONG DIRECTIONS
THE PRESENT FUNDING SYSTEM REWARDS EFFECTIVENESS AND RESULTS

YUP THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE FUNDING LEVELS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENTLY DECREASING RELATIVE TO THE NUMBER OF PHS THE OLDER SCIENTISTS TELL ME OF A TIME WHEN PROPOSALS WERE FUNDED AT A RATE OF AROUND IN 2 TO PROPOSALS NOW IT'S LESS THAN IN PROPOSALS

SOLUTION TALK TO YOUR CONGRESSMEN OR CONVINCE GOOGLE TO FUND BASIC SCIENCE OTHERWISE IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE

GRAD STUDENTS GET OUT WHILE YOU CAN
FINAL YEAR GRAD STUDENT HERE COULDN'T AGREE MORE I AM NOT EVEN APPLYING FOR ANY POSITIONS THIS IS NOT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK I COULD SECURE ONE BUT BECAUSE THE ACADEMIC SYSTEM IS SO FLAWED AS YOU SAY IT PROMOTES GOOD BUSINESSMEN ABOVE GOOD SCIENTISTS AND IF I WANTED TO GO INTO BUSINESS I COULD JUST DO THAT AND EARN MUCH MORE IN ANOTHER SECTOR

ALSO YES THE FUNDING SYSTEM IS APPALLING OF PUBLISHED SCIENCE IS MUNDANE BULLSHIT THAT WOULDN'T BE FUNDED IF THE PUBLIC KNEW WHAT THEY WERE PAYING FOR READ ANY GRANT PROPOSAL AND COMPARE IT WITH THE ACTUAL RESEARCH THAT CAME OUT OF THAT FUNDING AND IT'S CLEAR WHAT A BUNCH OF LIES GRANT PROPOSALS ARE

SO WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS FOR THOSE INTEREST IN PHYSICS RESEARCH IN THE US MOVE TO ANOTHER COUNTRY GO TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR
POSTS LIKE THESE ARE REALLY DISCOURAGING
SCIENTIST HERE A FEW COMMENTS

YES THE SYSTEM HAS ITS PROBLEMS BUT ALL SYSTEMS DO THERE WILL ALWAYS BE MORE IDEAS AND MORE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE SCIENTISTS THAN WE CAN EVER FUNDAMENTAL THE QUESTION IS HOW NOT IF WE PRIORITIZE GRANTS AT LEAST PROBABLY YEARS IS MY PERSONAL PARTIAL SOLUTION WOULD SCIENCE BE BETTER IF WE HAD A CENTRAL BUREAU THAT DECIDED ON PROJECTS BECAUSE THAT'S HOW MOST CORPORATIONS WORK
ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS IN SCIENCE IS THAT THERE ARE TOO MANY POSTDOCS AND OTHERS ON TEMPORARY CONTRACTS IT'S TOO EASY TO BECOME A POSTHOC TOO DIFFICULT TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP TO A PERMANENT JOB
IT'S A LOT LOT TOUGHER TO BE AVERAGE IN SCIENCE THAN IN INDUSTRY
CORPORATIONS ARE NOT RATIONAL OR DEVOID OF POLITICS EITHER FAR FROM BULLSHIT IDEAS FROM TOP MANAGEMENT GET PUSHED THROUGH ALL THE TIME IT'S JUST THAT IN COMPANIES IT'S ALL HAPPENING BEHIND CLOSED DOORS
BUT BECAUSE NUMBER OF PUBLICATIONS IS PROBABLY THE CRITERION BY WHICH THEY ARE JUDGED ON FOR JOBS IN ACADEMIA

NOT ALWAYS EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS IS AN INTERESTING CASE THE COLLABORATIONS ARE SO LARGE AND COMPLEX THAT IT IS HARD TO TELL WHO CONTRIBUTED HOW MUCH TO WHICH PUBLICATION AS RESULT EVERY MEMBER OF THE COLLABORATION GETS LISTED AS AUTHOR AT NEARLY EVERY PUBLICATION ALPHABETICALLY YOU CAN FINISH YOUR PHD WITH SOME NUMBER OF PUBLICATIONS WHERE YOU ARE LISTED AS AUTHOR ONE OUT OF POTENTIALLY ALWAYS AS FIRST AUTHOR IF YOU NAME STARTS WITH AB OR AID MANY OF THEM IN JOURNALS FROM OUTSIDE YOU CANNOT TELL WHO DID WHAT UNLESS YOU ASK FOR REFERENCES IN CBS YOU'LL OFTEN SEE THE PUBLICATION LIST REDUCED TO PAPERS WITH SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION AND THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS DESCRIBED FOR EACH PAPER

THE ORGANIZATION IS ALSO DIFFERENT YOU HAVE THE ORGANIZATION VIA THE INSTITUTES AND GRANTS WHERE THE MONEY GETS DISTRIBUTED AND THE ORGANIZATION VIA THE COLLABORATIONS WHERE THE SCIENCE AND ALSO THE LESS INTERESTING BUT NECESSARY WORK GET DISTRIBUTED WORKING ON RISKY TOPICS IS NOT EASY BUT YOU ALWAYS HAVE OTHER PROJECTS ONGOING SO YOU DON'T END UP WITH NOTHING SOME PROJECTS ARE MAINLY DONE BY SENIORS IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT THEY DON'T LOSE AS MUCH AS PHD STUDENTS OR POSTDOCS
CONDENSED MATTER PHD HERE TRANSPORT CORRELATED MATERIALS


THIS IS INTERESTING TO HEAR FROM A PLASMA PHYSICIST SINCE MOST OF THIS PHENOMENON AS FAR AS I CAN REMEMBER HAS BEEN REPORTED IN THE CONTEXT OF LIFE SOCIAL SCIENCES


FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE IT SEEMS TO BE MUCH TOUGHER TO PRODUCE FLUFF PAPERS AND HAVE THEM END UP IN APS OR NATURE WHEN MY PURPOSE IS TO READ EXCITING NEW PAPERS I MOSTLY PULL FROM APS EDITORS SUGGESTIONS OR PRB RAPID COMAS AND I THINK MOST PEOPLE DO AS WELL OR FIELD SPECIFIC JOURNALS I ONLY REALLY EVER DIVE INTO THE B CATALOGUE AS IT WERE WHEN I AM LOOKING FOR SOMETHING SPECIFIC LIKE SOME PARTICULAR SPECTROSCOPIC RESULT ETC


YOUR EXAMPLE THERE CHANGE A PARAMETER IN OUR CODE AND GET THIS NEW RESULT IS NOT NECESSARILY AN INVALID OR LOW QUALITY INSIGHT IF THE RESULT IS IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO ENABLE SOME PARTICULAR SYSTEM TO FUNCTION CORRECTLY FOR EXAMPLE DISCOVERIES HAVE BEEN MADE BY EXPLORING WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU EVALUATE A PERTURBATIVE CALCULATION TO ORDER ETC I WON'T COMMENT ON YOUR SPECIFIC CASE AS I HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT YOUR FIELD BUT I COULD MAP THIS TO GROWTH CONDITIONS FOR FILMS WHERE SOMEONE JUST HAPPENS TO DISCOVER A GOOD RECIPE AND REPORTS IT I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO SHARE AND WHEN IT'S SUPPLEMENTED WITH SOME NICE STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS FOR EXAMPLE CAN MAKE FOR A NICE REFERENCE WORK


THERE WERE SOME NICE ARTICLES ABOUT INCOME INEQUALITY IN NATURE RECENTLY I DON'T THINK THIS IS AN ISSUE WHEN IT BECOMES UNFEASIBLE TO CONTINUE IN ACADEMIA YOU'LL SEE A MOVEMENT TO INDUSTRIAL SCIENCE POSITIONS I PERSONALLY AM NOT AIMING TO END UP IN ACADEMIA AT ALL AND A LOT OF MY FELLOW COLLEAGUES SHARE THIS SENTIMENT SO THAT EFFECT IS ALREADY IN PLAY I THINK
HI THERE I'M A POSTHOC WORKING ON QUANTUM COMPUTING IN AUSTRALIA I'D LIKE TO RESPOND TO YOUR RANT SINCE I THINK YOUNG SCIENTISTS LIKE YOU AND I GENERALLY DON'T TAKE NEARLY THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE SHOULD FOR THE ROLE WE PLAY IN THE SYSTEM THAT EXISTS TODAY I OF COURSE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE WRITING IN PART AT LEAST OUT OF EMOTION BUT I THINK THAT ANY CURRENT OR ASPIRING SCIENTISTS OUT THERE SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO READ AT LEAST ONE REBUTTAL TO WHAT YOU HAVE SAID

I HAVE SEEN AND EXPERIENCED SOME OF THE PROCESSES BY WHICH SCIENCE IS DONE IN THIS COUNTRY THE PRODUCTION PROCESS OF SCIENCE SO TO SPEAK AND I THINK IT S PRETTY BAD

I THINK THERE ARE CERTAINLY PROBLEMS BUT I DON'T AGREE THAT THEY'RE AS CATEGORICALLY BAD AS YOU MAKE OUT OR AT LEAST I THINK THAT YOU HAVE MORE AGENCY IN THIS PROCESS THAN YOU MIGHT REALIZE

THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS HEAVILY BASED ON PEOPLE IN THE SO CALLED POSITIONS THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO DON T HAVE TENURE OR ARE NOT IN STABLE POSITIONS IN THEIR INSTITUTIONS AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS IS A VERY STRESSFUL SITUATION TO BE IN TENURED AND STABLE POSITIONS ARE GETTING MORE AND MORE RARE AND COMPETITION IS FIERCE

BUT A POSTHOC DEVELOPS A GREAT MANY HIGHLY TRANSFERRABLE SKILLS PEOPLE IN INDUSTRY WOULD KILL TO HAVE JOBS LIKE OURS OUR JOBS GIVE US A GREAT DEAL OF INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM AND BOUNDLESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONTINUED LEARNING WE OFTEN GET TO LEAD OTHER SCIENTISTS I EAST GRAD STUDENTS IN THEIR WORK AND COMMUNICATE OUR WORK TO HIRING MANAGERS SALIVATE WHEN THEY SEE A WELL-PREPARED RÉSUMÉ FROM A SEASONED POSTHOC

WHAT YOU ARE DESCRIBING IS QUITE NATURAL WHEN YOU VIEW ACADEMIA AS AN EMPLOYER'S MARKET THERE ARE MANY MORE QUALIFIED APPLICANTS THAN THERE ARE POSITIONS BUT AGAIN MOST PEOPLE IN INDUSTRY WOULD KILL TO HAVE RÉSUMÉS THAT LOOK LIKE OURS

AS A RESULT OF THIS SYSTEM CREATIVITY IS BEING PUSHED ASIDE BY EFFECTIVENESS

IS IT ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT A SCIENTIST WITH AN EXCELLENT IDEA THAT GAINS A LOT OF ATTENTION WOULDN'T HAVE IVY LEAGUE UNIVERSITIES FILLING HIS OR HER EMAIL BOX WITH JOB OFFERS CREATIVITY AND EFFECTIVENESS ARE NOT ORTHOGONAL

AND SCIENTISTS ARE VERY EFFECTIVE IN DELIVERING GUESS WHAT AND SOMETIMES INACCURATE ARTICLES

NO ARGUMENT THERE BUT I THINK THE FAULT LIES WITH US THE BEST WAY TO EVALUATE SCIENCE OR A SCIENTIST IS TO HAVE OTHER SCIENTISTS EVALUATE IT OR HIM OR HERALDRY WE SIMPLY HAVEN'T COME UP WITH A BETTER WAY TO DO THAT I'M WORKING ON THIS ARE YOU

THE NOTORIOUS PUBLISH OR PERISH CULTURE IS DETRIMENTAL TO SCIENCE

I AGREE THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'RE ASSIGNING THE BLAME CORRECTLY AND I DON'T THINK YOU'RE PROPOSING REASONABLE SOLUTIONS

IN THIS SYSTEM A SCIENTIST TO BE SUCCESSFUL HE SHE NEEDS TO BE GOOD AT NOT ONLY DOING SCIENTIFIC WORK BUT ALSO AT SELLING THEIR IDEA WHICH I THINK NOT OFTEN COME HAND-IN-HAND QUITE THE OPPOSITE IN FACT GREAT SCIENTISTS ARE USUALLY TERRIBLE AT MARKETING THEIR IDEA

I COMPLETELY DISAGREE WITH THIS THE BEST THINKERS GENERALLY NEVER MIND SCIENTISTS ARE CAPABLE OF PROVIDING EFFECTIVE SUMMARIES OF THEIR THOUGHT ON DEMAND TO ANY AUDIENCE

ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT SCIENTISTS ARE PUBLICLY FUNDED AND ARE THEREFORE PUBLIC SERVANTS YOU OWE IT TO THE PUBLIC TO EXPLAIN WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND WHY YOU ARE DOING IT IN A WAY THAT THEY CAN UNDERSTAND IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT I'M AFRAID I QUESTION WHETHER THE PUBLIC PURSE SHOULD BE USED TO PAY YOUR SALARY WHEN YOU ARE EMINENTLY EMPLOYABLE IN OTHER FIELDS OF HUMAN ENDEAVOUR

SCIENCE HAS BECOME TOO CORPORATE AND HIERARCHICAL AND BECOMING CORPORATE IS A GREAT INNOVATION KILLER

YEAH WHEN HAS A PRIVATE CORPORATION EVER INVENTED ANYTHING S

AT THE CENTER OF THIS SYSTEM IS THE WAY BY WHICH SCIENCE IS FUNDED

YOU HAVE A VERY APPROACH TO THIS MANY POSTDOCS LIKE MYSELF ARE WILLING TO TRAVEL TO OTHER COUNTRIES TO PLY OUR TRADE IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE AMERICAN APPROACH WHY NOT MOVE TO A NEW COUNTRY ALMOST EVERY PHYSICS DEPARTMENT I'VE VISITED LET ALONE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH WAS COMPOSED PRIMARILY OF IMMIGRANTS INCLUDING AMERICAN IMMIGRANTS

THE WAY THESE GRANTS ARE SELECTED IS ALSO ANOTHER PROBLEM IN MY OPINION SUCCESSFUL GRANT PROPOSAL WRITERS KNOW HOW TO CRAFT THEIR PROPOSALS JUST THE RIGHT WAY

PRESUMABLY YOU THINK THAT THE RIGHT WAY WITHIN THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS DIFFERENT FROM THE ACTUAL RIGHT WAY I CHALLENGE YOU TO EXPLAIN WHAT YOU THINK A GOOD STANDARD OF EVALUATING GRANT PROPOSALS WOULD LOOK LIKE

SOME RESEARCHERS THAT I'VE WORKED WITH HAVE TOLD ME THAT THEY SPEND ALMOST HALF OF THEIR TIME WORKING ON PROPOSAL WRITING EITHER DOING PRELIMINARY WORK OR WRITING THE PROPOSAL ITSELF OR JUST PLANNING WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO WRITE ABOUT

THAT'S WHAT MANAGERS DO IF YOU DON'T WANT THE JOB DON'T ASK FOR IT FIND A NEW JOB AGAIN YOU'RE EMINENTLY QUALIFIED FOR JOBS THAT OTHERS WOULD KILL FOR

THE WAY GRANT REVIEW PANELS WORK IS THAT THEY RE TRYING TO JUDGE A PROPOSAL BASICALLY ON TWO THINGS IMPACT ON THE FIELD AND LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS

YOU SEEM TO ASSUME FALSELY THAT GRANT REVIEW PANELS ARE CATEGORICALLY INCAPABLE OF FINDING A REASONABLE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN THESE TWO IMPORTANT CRITERIA I'VE KNOWN SEVERAL SCIENTISTS WHO HAVE WORKED ON GRANT REVIEW PANELS AND WHILE THEY ARE HUMAN AND THEREFORE FALLIBLE I HAVE YET TO MEET A SCIENTIST WHO ROUTINELY PARTICIPATES IN THE GRANT REVIEW PROCESS THAT SHOULDN'T BE DOING IT

I STRONGLY SUGGEST YOU FIND SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE WORKED ON THESE GRANT REVIEW PANELS AND ASK THEM A HOW THEY FORM THEIR OPINIONS AND B WHETHER THEY THINK THE REVIEW PROCESS IS LARGELY FAIR AND REASONABLE

BUT EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS

I DON'T KNOW THAT I THINK THAT ANY SERIOUS ENDEAVOUR REQUIRES INTELLIGENT PROJECT MANAGEMENT YOU SEEM TO THINK THAT SCIENCE HAPPENS BECAUSE SMART PEOPLE SIT IN A ROOM AND LOOK OUT THE WINDOW FOR EIGHT HOURS A DAY UNTIL INSPIRATION STRIKES I THINK THAT'S A MYTHOLOGY

I'D HAZARD A GUESS AT THIS POINT THAT YOU'RE A THEORIST SO AM I BUT I HAVE ENOUGH EXPERIMENTALIST FRIENDS TO KNOW HOW BAD PROJECT MANAGEMENT CAUSES GOOD SCIENTISTS TO BECOME COMPLETELY UNPRODUCTIVE AND UNMOTIVATED

YOU CAN'T PREDICT WHAT PROBLEMS YOUR RESEARCH WILL HAVE AND HOW YOU WILL OVERCOME IT IT'S SILLY

WELL MAYBE YOU CAN'T AGAIN HAVE A CHAT WITH A SUCCESSFUL SENIOR SCIENTIST AND ASK THEM THEIR ADVICE ABOUT HOW TO DO THINGS LIKE THIS AND WHETHER THEY THINK IT'S POSSIBLE

IF YOU DON'T WORK WITH SCIENCE YOU MAY BE SURPRISED TO LEARN HOW RESEARCHERS TALK ABOUT A FRUIT AND A LP LEAST PUBLISHABLE UNIT WHEN TALKING ABOUT THE PAPERS AND GRANT PROPOSALS THEY ARE GOING TO WRITE INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT HOW EXCITED THEY ARE ABOUT A NEW IDEA THEY ARE PURSUING THAT COULD BE REALLY RELEVANT TO THE FIELD AS EXPECTED THIS WHOLE SYSTEM LEADS TO A DRAMATIC NOSE DIVE IN TERMS OF QUALITY AND RELEVANCE OF PUBLISHED WORK

ARE YOU REALLY EXPECTING EVERY PAPER WRITTEN TO BE WORTHY OF THE NOBEL PRIZE THIS ARGUMENT IS COMPLETELY FREE OF COGENCY LET ALONE EVIDENCE SURELY YOU THINK THAT SCIENTISTS SHOULD TAKE CARE TO PUBLISH EVEN INCREMENTAL RESULTS SO THAT OTHER SCIENTISTS CAN LEARN FROM THEIR WORK AND PERHAPS EXTEND UPON IT

BESIDES THAT THE PROPOSAL SELECTION PROCESS IS EXTREMELY SUBJECTIVE

IS IT MY IMPRESSION IN QUANTUM COMPUTING AT LEAST IS THAT THE WORK THAT DEFINITELY OUGHT TO BE FUNDED IS RELIABLY FUNDED IT'S COMPETITIVE SURE AND THERE'S ALL SORTS OF SLEAZE IF YOU GO DIGGING FOR IT BUT IT'S NOT A LOTTERY

I ACTUALLY HEARD THIS EXACT PHRASE FROM A MORE SENIOR COLLEAGUE OF MINE ABOUT THE PROPOSAL SELECTION PROCESS IF YOU WRITE A GOOD PROPOSAL YOU GET A LOTTERY TICKET DEPENDING ON THE OPPORTUNITY I'D SAY BETWEEN AND OF THE PROPOSALS ARE PROPOSALS SUCCESS RATES IN MY FIELD LATELY HAVE BEEN AROUND TO

WITH RESPECT THAT MIGHT SAY SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR FIELD AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PEOPLE WHO PAY FOR YOUR WORK FEEL THEY ARE GETTING VALUE FROM IT I DON'T KNOW YOUR FIELD BUT I WOULD NOT SIMPLY ASSUME THAT FUNDING AGENCIES ARE OUT TO JERK YOU AROUND I'VE MET PROGRAM MANAGERS IN PASSING ANYWAY AND I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THEM BUT THE PEOPLE WHO PAY FOR RESEARCH HAVE LIMITED FUNDS AND SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES THE JUDGEMENT IS NOT SIMPLY ABOUT WHETHER YOUR SCIENCE IS GOOD BUT ALSO WHETHER THE PROPOSAL FITS WITH THE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OF THE FUNDING AGENCIES MONEY ESPECIALLY PUBLIC MONEY DOES NOT GROW ON TREES

BUT WHAT AMAZES ME MOST ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING IS HOW FLAKY THE SCIENCE DIRECTION OF THE ENTIRE COUNTRY IS

AGAIN MOVE TO A DIFFERENT COUNTRY AUSTRALIA IS ALWAYS GLAD TO GAIN NEW SCIENTISTS SO IS CANADA MY OTHER COUNTRY

I THINK SCIENCE IS LOSING A LOT OF ITS CREATIVE MINDS AT THE MOMENT WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO WRITE SUCCESSFUL PROPOSALS WHILE WORKING ON THEIR CRAZY ORIGINAL IDEAS ON THE SIDE BECAUSE THEY KNOW HIS CRAZY IDEA COULD NEVER GET FUNDED

WHICH IS WHY SCIENTISTS WRITE PROPOSALS FOR RESEARCH THAT IS MOSTLY FINISHED THAT WAY WE CAN GET PAID FOR THE WORK WE'VE ALREADY DONE AND HAVE A LITTLE SLACK TO PURSUE SOME OF THOSE CRAZY IDEAS TO AT LEAST SOME EXTENT

AT THE MOMENT I M SETTLED ON LEAVING THE ACADEMIC RESEARCH CAREER AFTER MY CURRENT TERM ENDS

I WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK IN YOUR FUTURE ENDEAVORS YOUR CRITICISMS SHOULD BE HEARD BY ANYONE AND EVERYONE WHO IS CONSIDERING A SCIENTIFIC CAREER PATHOLOGY BUT I THINK MY RESPONSE SHOULD BE HEARD TOO

BUT I DO CARE ABOUT DOING OR AT LEAST TRYING TO PRODUCE RELEVANT SCIENCE THAT'S MOSTLY WHAT I CARE ABOUT

RELEVANT TO WHOM I THINK THAT'S A CRITICAL QUESTION THAT TOO FEW SCIENTISTS ASK THEMSELVES IF YOU WANT TO GET PAID YOU HAVE TO DELIVER VALUE TO THE PEOPLE WHO PAY YOU
ACTUALLY I BELIEVE THAT SCIENCE IS NOT CORPORATE ENOUGH IN A WAY

WE HAVE CARRIED AN EVALUATION SYSTEM DESIGNED IN THE TIMES WHEN SINGLE INDIVIDUALS WOULD OFTEN MAKE VERY VALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS INTO AN ERA WHEN THIS IS PRETTY MUCH IMPOSSIBLE BARRING THE SUPER GENIUSES WE BABBLE ABOUT COLLABORATION AND NETWORKING BUT SCIENTIFIC GROUPS OFTEN ARE A COLLECTION OF PEOPLE INDIVIDUALLY DOING THEIR LITTLE PROJECTS VAGUELY RELATED TO THE OTHERS IN THE GROUP BECAUSE THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO GET A PAPER WITH YOUR NAME IN FIRST PLACE WHICH IS ALL THAT YOU NEED TO ADVANCE IN YOUR CAREER

WE NEED A SYSTEM THAT RELIABLY CREATES LARGE GROUPS WITH CLEARLY DEFINED GOALS AND DIVISION OF LABOR LIKE IN INDUSTRY AND ONE THAT REWARDS THE WORK OF WORKERS IN A MORE MEANINGFUL WAY INSTEAD OF PUSHING YOUNG PEOPLE TO PRETEND THEY'LL BE THE NEXT RICHARD FEYNMAN REALIZE THEY CAN'T BE AFTER A FEW YEARS AND THEN DROP OUT TO FIND A REAL JOB IN THE REAL WORLD
EXCELLENT POST YOU NAILED SO MUCH I SAW MOST OF THIS AS WELL WHILE I WAS GETTING MY PHD WORKING AT A NATIONAL LAB IN THE US FOR SIX YEARS WISH I COULD ELABORATE MORE BUT I DON'T HAVE THE TIME RIGHT NOW EVERYONE CONSIDERING GOING TO GRAD SCHOOL OR INTO ACADEMIA NEEDS TO READ YOUR POST I'VE QUIT ACADEMIA BECAUSE IT REALLY ISN'T A PLACE I FELT COMFORTABLE OR EXCITED TO BE MOST OF THE TIME
HEY

I AM LIFE SCIENCES POSTHOC IN THE UK SAME PROBLEMS HERE JUST TO LET YOU KNOW

DAN
GRADUATED HS LAST YEAR AND I'M SOON GOING INTO UNIVERSITY RESEARCH HAS BEEN MY DREAM FOR A WHILE SHOULD I JUST GO FOR ENGINEERING AND GIVE UP ON IT IS IT REALLY SO BAD
I'M A FIRST YEAR PHD STUDENT AND I'M ONLY JUST STARTING TO SEE THE UGLY SIDE OF PUBLISHING MY PHD PROGRAMME IS PUSHING US TO PUBLISH A PAPER BY THE END OF OUR FIRST YEAR IE IN A MONTH MY COLLEAGUES TOLD ME TO SUBMIT AN ABSTRACT TO A CONFERENCE SO I CAN PRESENT A POSTER ON FRANKLY SHITTY RESULTS MY PROFESSOR IS LOSING PATIENCE WITH ME BECAUSE HE WANTS ME TO SHOW HIM SOME SOLID RESULTS ASAP

I GET THAT IN THE REAL WORLD MONEY DRIVES A LOT OF RESEARCH BUT THE PRESSURE TO JUST GET RESULTS IS ASTOUNDING TRUTHFULLY I CAN PULL RESULTS OUT OF THIN AIR BY ADAPTING SOMEONE METHOD TO A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT MODEL AND BY LOOKING AT SIMILAR PARAMETERS BUT THE END RESULT IS RARELY ANYTHING IMPACTFUL OR INTERESTING OTOH IF I'M GIVEN BREATHING ROOM TO EXPLORE MY OWN IDEAS AND DISCUSS THEM TO GREAT LENGTHS WITH MY PEERS IT COULD LEAD TO SOMETHING WITH MORE SCIENTIFIC VALUE

IT'S EMOTIONALLY EXHAUSTING TO FEEL CYCLICAL ABOUT ACADEMIA THOUGH AND I INTEND TO FINISH MY PHD WITHIN THE YEAR FUNDING PERIOD SO I'LL PLAY BY THE RULES IF I HAVE TO BUT READING YOUR POST IS JUST ANOTHER REMINDER THAT THE POST DOC LIFE LOOKS RUBBISH
I'M IN ENGINEERING RATHER THAN PHYSICS BUT MY EXPERIENCE WITH ACADEMIA AT RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES IN THE U SOUTH WAS PRETTY SIMILAR TO YOURS THE LARGEST DIFFERENCE I SAW IS THAT PUBLISH OR PERISH IS ACTUALLY A BIT OUTDATED WIN FEDERAL GRANTS OR PERISH WOULD BE MORE ACCURATE PUBLISHING MATTERS MOSTLY AS A WAY TO IMPROVE YOUR CHANCES OF WINNING GRANTS OTHERWISE IT IS SECONDARY EVERYTHING ELSE IS TERTIARY

THE ONE TIME I WAS ABLE TO INTERVIEW FOR A POSITION I NOTICED THAT THE FIRST TWO QUESTIONS MOST FACULTY ASKED ME WERE WHAT WILL BE YOUR SOURCE OF FUNDING AND WHAT PROBLEM WILL YOU STUDY IN EITHER ORDER THEY SEEMED TO EXPECT ME TO HAVE A GRANT PROPOSAL I DIDN'T HAVE ADEQUATE ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS AND NOT SUPRISINGLY I DIDN'T GET THE POSITION

AFTER REFLECTING ON THAT EXPERIENCE AND HOW MY FRIENDS COLLEAGUES WHO HAD OBTAINED FACULTY POSITIONS SEEMED TO CONSTANTLY BE UNDER THE GUN TO FINISH A GRANT PROPOSAL I DECIDED I DIDN'T HAVE THE ENERGY FOR IT AND LEFT ACADEMIA I MAKE JEWELRY NOW ONE OF MY MAJOR DISILLUSIONMENTS WAS THAT ACADEMIC FREEDOM DOESN'T REALLY MEAN MUCH UNLESS YOU HAVE TENURE AT LEAST MOSTLY YOU HAVE THE FREEDOM TO FIND A PROJECT THAT WILL GET FUNDED OTHERWISE YOU HAVE THE FREEDOM TO FIND A DIFFERENT JOB
DISCLAIMER NOT A RESEARCHER

HOWEVER I THINK IT'S YOUR DUTY OR AT LEAST A WOULD BE GOOD DEED TO GIVE ACTIONABLE SUGGESTIONS OR EVEN ACTIONABLE PRINCIPLES ON HOW SCIENCE FUNDING COULD BE IMPROVED JUST CRITICISM IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH ESPECIALLY COMING FROM SOMEONE AS EXPERIENCED AS YOU ARE

I MEAN MOST LIKELY JUST HANDING OUT MONEY RANDOMLY MAKING IT LITERALLY A LOTTERY SINCE WE CAN'T FUND EVERYONE WOULDN'T BE A BETTER OPTION ALSO WHEN YOU USE ASSESSMENTS PEOPLE CAN GET EVEN MORE FRUSTRATED THAN IN THIS SYSTEM I IMAGINE IT BECOMES EVEN MORE OF A GAME OF POLITICS I EAST BEING LIKABLE WITH LITTLE REGARD FOR SCIENCE BUT I ADMIT I DON'T HAVE REALLY SOLID EXPERIENCE AND WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE

BUT MY CONCLUSION IS THAT WE NEED AT LEAST A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF OBJECTIVITY THAT IS MAXIMIZING A CERTAIN METRIC WITH THE DATA WE HAVE ABOUT THE RESEARCHER THAT INDICATES HOW LIKELY HE IS TO PRODUCE GOOD SCIENCE I EAST THE EXPECTED VALUE OF HIS PROPOSAL SO THE QUESTION WOULD BE WHAT ARE THE BEST INDICATORS OF THAT ARE THE CURRENT INDICATORS TOO BIASED AMENABLE TO GAMING



I PERSONALLY BELIEVE ACADEMIA SHOULD BE BIASED TOWARDS MORE HIGH VALUE USUALLY LOW PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS PROPOSALS INDUSTRY IS USUALLY REALLY KEEN ON RESEARCH HOW WE IMPROVE THIS PROCESS BY A TINY AMOUNT WE USE THIS WIDELY KNOWN METHOD IN THIS WIDELY KNOWN FIELD WITH PREDICTABLE SUCCESS ETC OFTEN DRIVEN STRAIGHT TO MARKET THE ONLY DOWNSIDE OF THAT IS INDUSTRY ISN'T SO KEEN ON SHARING RESULTS OR PUBLISHING WHICH CAN HAMPER PROGRESS AND I BELIEVE ACADEMIA ACTUALLY DERIVES A GOOD SOURCE OF INCOME FROM SECURE RESEARCH SO MAYBE A WELL THOUGHT OUT MIX OF THE TWO PROBABLY FINE TUNED BY FIELD AND AIDED BY LOTS OF DATA AND STATISTICS WOULD BE IDEAL
THE SYSTEM IS SHIT AND FULL OF PROBLEMS BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER YOU WANT TO DO SCIENCE OR NOT AND IF SO WHERE
IT ISN'T JUST IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY I SEE THIS PHENOMENA EVERYWHERE THAT PEOPLE IN EVERY PROFESSION ARE REQUIRED TO BE SALESMEN FIRST AND FOREMOST AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE JOB WILL ALWAYS TAKE A BACK SEAT TO SALES CONSIDERATIONS THIS DOES NOT BODE WELL FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LOUSY AT SALES BUT OTHERWISE EXCELLENT AT THEIR JOBS

MUCH OF WHAT YOU OBSERVE IS A CONSEQUENCE OF CHRONIC SHORTAGES IN SCIENTIFIC FUNDING IN THE U SOUTH PARTICULARLY FOR BASIC RESEARCH THIS LEADS TO RISK AVERSION ON THE PART OF FUNDING AGENCIES AND GENERATIONS OF SCIENTISTS WHO HAVE ADAPTED TO THIS ENVIRONMENT IN THE MANNER YOU OBSERVE IN PARTICULAR YOU GET A LOT OF FACULTY EXPERTS IN A NARROW FIELD PUBLISHING LARGELY INCREMENTAL WORK AND PUTTING OUT STUDENTS SIMILARLY NARROWLY TRAINED THE LABS AREN'T ANY BETTER WITH RESPECT TO RISK AVERSION

WE COULD SOLVE THIS WERE ONE OF THE MAJOR POLITICAL PARTIES IN THE U SOUTH NOT HOSTILE TO FUNDING BASIC RESEARCH AS SUCH I DON'T EXPECT TO SEE THIS CHANGE ANYTIME SOON
TO ANYONE WHO THINKS THESE ARE NEW ISSUES LOOK INTO THE YOUNG SCIENTISTS NETWORK CIRCA SOUTH IT WAS DAYS BUT WE HAD EMAIL LISTS TO COMMUNICATE BACK THEN

BASICALLY A BUNCH OF UNEMPLOYED DISSATISFIED YOUNG PHYSICISTS ORGANIZED AND GOT A FEW OF THEIR MEMBERS ELECTED TO THE BOARD OF THE AMERICAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY POSITIONS THAT USUALLY WERE FILLED BY TENURE PHYSICS PROFESSORS

I'M NOT SURE WHAT IF ANYTHING IT CHANGED BUT IT HAPPENED BACK THEN

HERE'S AN PDF ARTICLE FROM SCIENCE IN
THERE ARE GREAT RESEARCH SCIENTISTS AND THERE ARE GREAT PROJECT SCIENTISTS

EAST J COREY IS A GREAT RESEARCH SCIENTIST THE SCRAPS OF HIS PAPERS SPAWN CAREERS BUT HE IS A FUNDAMENTALLY WORKING WELL INSIDE ACADEMIA IN A FIELD WHICH IS MATURE AND HARD TO GET FUNDING IN AND HE ONLY GETS DONE WHAT HE GETS DONE BECAUSE HE IS SO GOOD THAT HE WON A NOBEL NOT FOR ANY ONE DISCOVERY BUT JUST FOR KICKING ASS FOR YEARS HIS STUDENTS WORK HOURS THAT EAST ROYAL SURGEONS WOULD CONSIDER CRUEL AND UNUSUAL


CRAIG VENTNER IS ONE OF THE MOST BRILLIANT PROJECT SCIENTISTS OF ALL TIME IN THAT HE SAW THIS SHIT COMING FROM A MILE AWAY AND FIGURED OUT HOW TO APPLY AN ENGINEERING GOOD ENOUGH MINDSET AND PURSUE INDUSTRY MONEY TO FORM A HYBRID RESEARCH ENGINE WHICH HAS DONE A LOT OF COOL SHIT THERE ARE MORAL AMBIGUITIES TO RESEARCH BUT HE GETS SHIT DONE

THE ACADEMIC WORLD YOU SEE IS AN UNFORTUNATE CONSEQUENCE OF THE HARSH REALITIES OF MODERN DECAYING LATE STAGE CAPITALISM BACHELORS DEGREES ARE MORE AND MORE UBIQUITOUS AND FINANCING IS INCREASINGLY AVAILABLE BECAUSE ECONOMIC GROWTH IS MODERNLY DRIVEN MORE BY FINANCE THAN PRODUCTION THIS IS BECAUSE WESTERN CULTURE HAS MOSTLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO PRODUCE WHAT IT NEEDS AND THAT IS A PITTANCE COMPARED TO THE SPENDING POWER OF THE VERY RICHARD EDUCATIONAL LOANS ARE OSTENSIBLY A BULLETPROOF INVESTMENT AND SO MONEY FLOWS TOWARDS THEM AND COLLEGE PRICES INCREASE EVEN AS STATES CUTS FUNDING FOR THEIR COLLEGES

NOW COLLEGE IS MORE EXPENSIVE LESS VALUABLE AND MORE UBIQUITOUS THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN BEFORE OF PEOPLE OVER HAVE COLLEGE DEGREES THE PEOPLE BEST AT SCHOOL OFTEN GO INTO STEM AND DISCOVER THAT WITH THEIR B A ALONE IT IS HARD TO GET A DEGREE THAT WILL PAY OFF THEIR STUDENT LOANS AND LET THEM LIVE COMFORTABLY WHY BECAUSE THE U SOUTH HAS MILLION DOCTORAL STUDENTS OVER MILLION POST SECONDARY HOLDING STUDENTS THESE PEOPLE ARE THEN IN AN INCREDIBLY VULNERABLE POSITION WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO TAKE THERE B A AND MAKE SOMETHING FOR THEMSELVES WITH IT THEY ARE IN A LOT OF DEBT AND THEY FOLLOW THE HISTORICAL PATH OUT OF THAT DEBT MORE EDUCATION

THIS IS A DEAD END I ONCE APPLIED FOR A POSITION WHERE I WAS TO CONTROL A VIVARIUM TRACKING AND BREEDING MICE FOR THE PURPOSES OF USING THEIR RETINAL TISSUE FOR AN EXPERIMENTAL BIOSENSOR DEVICE I WAS ALSO SUPPOSED TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE TO CONTROL THE LASER OPTICS USED TO TEST THESE DEVICES AND OBTAIN A SECURITY CLEARANCE IN ORDER TO HANDLE THE NIGHT VISION AND OPTICS USED TO WORK IN THIS LAB SPACE THE PAY FOR THAT JOB AN HOUR I LOST OUT ON THE POSITION TO SOMEONE WITH ABOUT YEARS MORE SCHOOL THAN ME WHAT THE FUCK

THESE ARE A LOT OF TANGENTIAL EXAMPLES BUT MY CORE POINT IS THIS THE SYSTEM YOU SEE IS A SYMPTOM OF A MUCH LARGER PROBLEM PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO COMPETE FOR WEALTH AND RESOURCES FOR ABOUT YEARS OF THE LAST CENTURY SMART PEOPLE FIGURED OUT A WAY TO MONOPOLIZE PART OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC PIE WHICH WAS TO PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION AND DEVELOP RARE SKILLS WHICH ATTRACTED A FAIR BIT OF MONEY NOW THAT FIELD IS SATURATED ITS PRIMARY BENEFIT TO SOCIETY DISTORTED AND ONLY THE VERY BEST OF THE BEST MAKE ANY MONEY JUST LIKE TEXTILES SMARTPHONES HIGH FREQUENCY TRADERS SECURITY ANALYSTS ETC ETC ACADEMIA IS A MATURE FIELD WHERE THE SMARTEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD COMPETE FOR SHIT FUNDING ESPECIALLY IN SAFE PLAY IT AGAIN RESEARCH

BUT PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS FIGURING OUT NEW HUSTLES AND NEW WAYS TO EXPLOIT THAT PIE SOFTWARE WAS EASY PICKING ONCE HARDER NOW BANKING AND ADVERTISING ARE BIG NOW BUT INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE I'M SURE GIVEN ENOUGH TIME THOSE TOO WILL BE SATURATED AND HARD TO EXPLOIT

THE MORAL IS THAT TO SUCCEED YOU HAVE TO TAKE WHAT YOU HAVE NOW AND REALIZE THAT ALL THE MODELS OF SUCCESS WHICH CAME BEFORE YOU ARE PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE PICKED OVER BY THE VULTURES AND COPYCATS BY NOW EVEN FINANCE IS STAGNATING THE WORLD ECONOMY IS MOVING TO A SLOW GROWTH HIGH INSTABILITY ECONOMIC SITUATION WITH AN AGING SKILLED POPULATION INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING WILL FOCUS ON THE NEW TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE OLD AND THE SAME OLD CONSTANTS MEDICINE SHELTER CLOTHING FOOD AND WEAPONS WILL REMAIN VALUABLE FOREVER BECAUSE ALL LIVING HUMANS NEED THEM PLAY THE ACADEMIC GAME WHILE IT SERVES YOU BUT DON'T FORGET IT IS A STEPPING OFF POINT FOR YOU TO FIGURE OUT YOUR OWN CRACKS IN THE SYSTEM TO EXPLOIT SO THAT YOU CAN DO YOUR PIE IN THE SKY RESEARCH
I AGREE WITH YOU EVEN AS AN UNDERGRAD

WHO BENEFITS FROM THIS SYSTEM THIS SEEMS LIKE A VERY INEFFICIENT WAY TO DISTRIBUTE MONEY AND I'M NOT SURE IF THERE IS ANY INCENTIVE TO KEEP IT GOING

IN YOUR OPINION WHAT WOULD HELP CHANGE THIS SYSTEM
PHYSICS POSTHOC HERE MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS

THE PRECARIOUS NATURE OF EMPLOYMENT AND SYSTEMATIC ABSURDITIES ARE NOT EXCLUSIVE TO ACADEMIA

INDEED IT IS MORE OF A RULE IN PRESENT DAY CAPITALISM

I INVITE YOU TO DISCUSS THESE ISSUES IN

R SOCIALISM

A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE IS FINISHING UP HIS PHD IN PURE MATH HIS WIFE GRADUATED LAST SEMESTER IN THE SAME FIELD AFTER STRUGGLING TO FIND JOBS IN ACADEMIA BOTH DECIDED TO GO INTO THE CORPORATE WORLD THAT'S TWO VERY INTELLIGENT AND DRIVEN PEOPLE WITH PHS THAT WOULD LOVE TO DO RESEARCH BUT COULDN'T FIND A JOB IT'S EVEN HARD TO GET A POST DOC WHICH IS HARDLY A LUCRATIVE POSITION

MY ONE OF MY ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING PROFESSORS SUMMED IT UP QUITE NICELY HE SAID EINSTEIN WOULDN'T LAST LONG AT MY SCHOOL BECAUSE THESE DAYS IT'S LESS ABOUT THE QUALITY OF YOUR WORK OR HOW MANY PAPERS YOU GET PUBLISHED AND MORE ABOUT HOW MUCH GRANT MONEY YOU CAN BRING THE SCHOOL

INCIDENTALLY HE ALSO TOLD ME A STORY ABOUT ALL THE DRAMA POLITICS AND BACKSTABBING THAT HAPPENED WHEN HE GOT A HUGE RESEARCH GRANT EVERYONE WANTED A PIECE OF THE PIE EVENTUALLY SOMEONE WAS PUSHED OUT THEY WERE DISGRUNTLED SO THEY SPILLED THE BEANS ON WHAT WAS GOING ON A HIGH LEVEL ADMINISTRATOR AT THE SCHOOL WAS FIRED AND THE FUNDING WAS PULLED SO NO ONE GOT ANYTHING
I'M A MATH STATS GUY WORKING ON A PHD IN PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY IT'S INTERESTING AND SADDENING TO SEE HOW COMMON THE PROBLEMS OP DESCRIBED ARE IN MY FIELD HYPE IS EVERYTHING
THAT'S QUITE SAD I'M DOING AN UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE IN PHYSICS WITH THE GOAL OF GOING INTO REASEARCH BUT AFTER READING THIS I DON'T KNOW HOW FEASIBLE THAT IS GOING TO BE IS IT WORTH IT IN THE END
I WORK AT A NATIONAL LABORATORY THAT SYSTEM IS ALSO DEVOID OF EFFECTIVE SCIENCE THERE IS NO INCENTIVE TO TAKE RISKS RATHER THE OPPOSITE AND WITHOUT RISKS THERE ARE NO BIG REWARDS
THIS EXACTLY IS THE REASON I DECIDED NOT TO GO INTO RESEARCH I STARTED MY BS IN PHYSICS PROGRAM THINKING I COULD GET A PHD AND DO SOME REALLY COOL FULFILLING RESEARCH THROUGHOUT MY UNDERGRAD CAREER THOUGH I SLOWLY DISCOVERED JUST HOW MUCH BULLSHIT YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH TO BE A RESEARCH SCIENTIST THESE DAYS I REMEMBER HAVING PROFESSORS IN MY UPPER LEVEL CLASSES COME TO CLASS LATE LOOKING LIKE THEY HADN'T SLEPT IN DAYS AND APOLOGIZING BECAUSE THEY'D BEEN UP ALL NIGHT WORKING ON GRANT PROPOSALS ADD TO THAT THE FACT THAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO TEACH CLASSES ON TOP OF ALL THAT GOD FORBID IT'S AN INTRO LEVEL CLASS FILLED WITH THAT DON'T GIVE A SHIT AND ALL THE SHIT THAT COMES WITH THAT IT JUST BEEN TOO MUCH FOR ME

SO I DECIDED TO GO THE APPLIED TRACK AND NOW I'M WORKING ON MY MASTERS IN CS MOST OF THE PROFESSORS I KNEW AND WORKED WITH IN UNDERGRAD WERE GREAT AND REALLY SEEMED TO ENJOY WHAT THEY DID BUT I JUST DON'T THINK I DONE THAT FOR MY CAREER AFTER LEARNING ALL THIS
COULDN'T AGREE MORE IT FEELS ALMOST TABOO TO TALK ABOUT IT PEOPLE VERY QUICKLY MAKE IT ABOUT YOU INSTEAD OF SCIENCE SO I'M VERY GLAD YOU DID I'M IN LIFE SCIENCES RATHER THAN PHYSICS BUT I'VE ALWAYS THOUGH IT WASN'T AS BAD OUTSIDE THE SQUISHY SCIENCES SAD TO HEAR IT'S NOT SO I'M JUST FINISHING UP MY MSC IN THE NETHERLANDS AND AM FINDING IT CONSIDERABLY HARDER TO FIND A JOB OUTSIDE ACADEMIA THAN I THOUGH TURNS OUT ACADEMIC EXPERIENCE DOESN'T COUNT FOR MUCH I HOPE YOU FIND A NICE PLACE TO DO SOME PROPER SCIENCE

AND DON'T FEEL BAD ABOUT NOT HAVING A SOLUTION GETTING PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THE PROBLEM IS MORE IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW
I HAD A PROFESSOR IN COLLEGE WHOSE LAB I WORKED IN BRIEFLY THE FIRST THING HE TAUGHT NEW STUDENTS IN THE LAB WAS HOW TO SELL A GRANT PROPOSAL AND HE STRONGLY IMPLIED THAT THE AUDIENCE KNOWS LITTLE AND YOU WANT TO INCORPORATE THE RIGHT BUZZWORDS VERY SAD THOUGH I DON'T KNOW WHAT A BETTER SYSTEM MIGHT BE
SEEMS LIKE THIS SYSTEM LEAVES NO ROOM FOR NICHE RESEARCH AT ALL WHAT ABOUT ALL THE IMPORTANCE SCIENCE THAT COMES OUT OF NOWHERE AND COULD NOT HAVE BEEN PREDICTED BY SOME BOARD OF DUDES ARE THERE ANY OPTIONS FOR SCIENTISTS LOOKING TO DO INEXPENSIVE RESEARCH OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME LIKE IF I WANTED TO CONDUCT A LONG TERM AND EXTENSIVE STUDY YEARS EVEN BUT ONLY NEEDED A SMALL BUDGET OVER THAT TIME PERIOD COULD A PUBLIC FUNDS PROGRAM SUSTAIN THAT SCIENCE MIGHT MOVE SLOWER THAT WAY BUT AT LEAST IT WOULD GIVE MORE NOVEL SOLUTIONS A PLACE TO GROW OUTSIDE OF INDIVIDUAL WEALTH

I HONESTLY HAVE NOT A CLUE I AM AN ENGLISH UNDERGRADUATE WITH ZERO EXPERIENCE WITH ACADEMIA
MATHS HERE IT'S NOT JUST IN THE USA THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM IT'S ESSENTIALLY EVERYWHERE THOUGH WITH VARIATION

THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN SAY EXACTLY WHAT PAPERS YOU WILL WRITE AND WHEN IS BEYOND STUPID I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW ANYONE CAN HAVE THOUGHT THIS WAS A SENSIBLE IDEA BECAUSE YOU DON'T NEED TO BE ON THE FRONT LINE OF RESEARCH TO REALISE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE I'D SAY IT'S EVEN LESS POSSIBLE IN MATHEMATICS THAN IN THE SCIENCES BECAUSE YOU OFTEN REALLY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE TRUTH IS WHEN YOU START RESEARCHING A PROBLEM IN MATHEMATICS NEVER MIND WHAT PROBLEMS MIGHT CROP UP IN DISCOVERING THE TRUTH HOW THEN ARE YOU TO SAY WHAT THE OUTCOME OF THE ENTIRE PROJECT WILL BE NEVER MIND WHAT PAPERS YOU'RE GOING TO WRITE IN THE FIRST YEAR

A COMMON STRATEGY IN MATHEMATICS THAT YOU DON'T MENTION IS TO DO THE RESEARCH FOR THE NEXT GRANT WHILE BEING FUNDED BY THE CURRENT ONE THEN YOU WRITE THE NEXT GRANT APPLICATION AND SAY YOU WILL RESEARCH WHAT YOU'VE ALREADY DONE AND WRITE IT UP IN THE FIRST MONTHS OF COURSE IF YOU THEN DON'T MANAGE TO COMPLETE SOMETHING THIS STRATEGY CEASES TO WORK
BRAVO THANK YOU FOR WRITING THIS I WAS A RESEARCH SCIENTIST IN PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY FOR OVER A DECADE IN A SOFT MONEY POSITION I LEFT TWO YEARS AGO TO GO WORK IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT I'M SERIOUSLY UNDERUTILIZING MY SKILLS BUT I NEEDED THE STABILITY FIT EXACTLY THE READINGS YOU POINT OUT
HAVING BEEN THROUGH MUCH OF WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH AND EVENTUALLY ENDING UP IN INDUSTRY GOOGLE HERE IS MY PERSPECTIVE

I AGREE THAT SCIENCE HAS SOME SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS THAT SAID I DON'T BELIEVE THOSE ISSUES MOSTLY HAVE TO DO WITH DECIDING WHO GETS MONEY AND WHERE THAT MONEY GOES YES FUNDING COMMITTEES WILL SOMETIMES ENGAGE IN GROUPTHINK THAT MIGHT EXCLUDE OUTSIDE IDEAS BUT THEY ARE COMMITTEES OF INFORMED PEERS AND ARE GENERALLY TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING SCIENCE IS A SPECULATIVE ENTERPRISE AND WE HAVE TO ACCEPT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE OPTIMAL FUNDING DECISIONS YES YOU COULD POINT TO THE ODD BRILLIANT THINKER WHOSE NOVEL IDEAS GOT PASSED OVER BUT WE CAN ALSO POINT TO A HUNDRED CRACKPOTS THAT ARE INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM A FUNDING COMMITTEE'S PERSPECTIVE

I BELIEVE THE SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS IN SCIENCE TODAY HAVE MOSTLY TO DO WITH THE STANDARDS BY WHICH RESEARCH IS REVIEWED PUBLISHED AND REWARDED PROBLEMS LIKE

NULL RESULTS ARE GENERALLY CONSIDERED UNPUBLISHABLE
2 SCIENTISTS FEEL A STRONG PRESSURE TO PUBLISH SURPRISING RESULTS
THERE IS GENERALLY LITTLE INCENTIVE OR REWARD TO REPRODUCE ANOTHER'S PUBLISHED RESULTS
MOST SCIENTISTS HAVE LITTLE IF ANY FORMAL TRAINING IN STATISTICS INDEPENDENT REVIEWS SHOW THAT THE MAJORITY OF PUBLISHED ARTICLES HAVE SIGNIFICANT ERRORS IN METHODOLOGY AND MOST REVIEWERS ARE ILL-EQUIPPED TO CATCH THESE
IT IS EXCEEDINGLY RARE FOR PEOPLE TO PUBLISH ALL OF THE DATA AND ANALYSIS CODE ETC NEEDED TO REPLICATE THE KEY FINDINGS IN A PAPER IT SHOULD BE STANDARD THAT WHEN THERE IS A GRAPH OR A SIMULATION PRESENTED IN A PAPER THAT YOU PUBLISH THE R CODE OR FORTRAN CODE OR WHATEVER THAT PRODUCED THAT GRAPH FAILING TO DO SO MADE SENSE YEARS AGO BUT IN THE ERA OF THE INTERNET IT IS I BELIEVE BORDERLINE CRIMINAL IF YOU ARE USING TAXPAYER FUNDS

IN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH IT HAS GOTTEN TO A POINT WHERE A GOOD FRACTION OF PUBLISHED WORK SIMPLY CAN'T BE BELIEVED

THERE IS A COMPLETELY SEPARATE SET OF ISSUES AT THE PERSONAL LEVEL HAVING TO DO WITH SCIENCE AS A CAREER AS LONG AS SCIENCE RELIES HEAVILY ON GRAD STUDENTS AND POSTDOCS TO PROPEL RESEARCH AND AS LONG AS FACULTY TURN OUT THE NUMBER OF PHS THEY DO IT WILL ALWAYS BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE MAJORITY OF THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE TO GET GOOD ACADEMIC JOBS THIS IS JUST MATHEMATICS

THAT SAID IF YOU CAN DEPROGRAM YOURSELF A BIT FROM WHAT THE ACADEMIC CULTURE IS TELLING YOU SCIENCE IS THE ONLY INTERESTING CAREER YOU'RE A SELLOUT IF YOU LEAVE ACADEMIA ETC YOU'LL REALIZE THAT YOUR LIFE PROSPECTS ARE PHENOMENALLY GOOD TECHNICAL PHS HAVE THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OF ANY CATEGORY OF PEOPLE MANY COMPANIES LOVE TO HIRE PEOPLE WITH QUANTITATIVE CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS WHO CAN WORK INDEPENDENTLY IT'S MOSTLY JUST A MATTER OF YOU THE INDIVIDUAL HAVING AN OPEN MIND ABOUT WHO YOU ARE WHAT YOU CAN DO AND WHAT IS INTERESTING OUT IN THE WORLD

FOR MYSELF I THOUGHT OF SCIENCE AS A FUN FIRST CAREER WHERE I HAD A LOT OF FREEDOM AND HAD A GREAT TIME IF I'D BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO HIT ON A BIG DISCOVERY DURING THOSE YEARS THEN PERHAPS I'D HAVE BEEN PROPELLED INTO A FACULTY JOB BUT THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN AND I'M NOT WORRIED I HAD FUN AND IT'S A HUGE WORLD OUT THERE

WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD WHERE IT'S NOT ALL SUNSHINE AND ROSES WHERE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE PEOPLE THAT MEET YOUR DEFINITION OF THE MOST SKILLED OR PRODUCTIVE WELCOME TO A WORLD WHERE YOU HAVE TO PLAY POLITICS TO ADVANCE NOT JUST FOCUS ON YOUR JOB I GOT NEWS FOR YOU THIS IS LIFE LOOK AT ANY OTHER FIELD HOW MANY PEOPLE GO INTO POLITICS WITH A SINCERE DESIRE TO CHANGE THE WORLD FOR THE BETTER ONLY TO SEE PEOPLE LIKE DONALD TRUMP PASS THEM BY HOW MANY PEOPLE BECOME TEACHERS HOPING TO HELP KIDS ONLY TO BECOME BITTER AND JADED BY THE ENTIRE SYSTEM AND THE STUDENTS AFTER A FEW YEARS REALITY SUCKS SOMETIMES BELIEVE ME I KNOW WHAT I HAVE REALIZED THOUGH AFTER SPENDING MANY YEARS IN ACADEMIA IN A PHYSICS LAB NO LESS IS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY SKILLED ARE THE ONES WHO ARE ABLE TO NAVIGATE THAT SYSTEM AND PRODUCE GOOD SCIENCE THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE THAT I HAVE MET MANY OF THEM AND THEY ARE VERY IMPRESSIVE PEOPLE I SUSPECT IT'S THE SAME IN MANY OTHER FIELDS OBAMA WAS ABLE TO NAVIGATE A FRACTURED AND POLARIZED POLITICAL SYSTEM AND ENACT REAL CHANGE IF HE HAD TAKEN YOUR ATTITUDE HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN UP AND DROPPED OUT ENTIRELY ONCE HE SAW THE FLAWS IN THE SYSTEM

YOU ARE GIVING UP BECAUSE THE SYSTEM ISN'T WORKING THE WAY YOU THINK IT SHOULD THAT'S OK I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND WHY YOU FEEL THAT WAY AND WHY YOU ARE MAKING THAT DECISION BUT THE FACT IS IF YOU REALLY TRULY WANTED TO DO GOOD SCIENCE YOU STILL COULD YOU COULD FIND WAYS TO DO THE RESEARCH YOU WANT TO DO WITHIN THAT SYSTEM IT MIGHT REQUIRE SACRIFICE IT MIGHT REQUIRE A LOT OF HARD WORK IT MIGHT REQUIRE DOING A LOT OF STUFF YOU DON'T LIKE DOING SCHMOOZING WITH PEOPLE YOU DON'T LIKE WORKING ON PROJECTS YOU DON'T LIKE ETC MAYBE FOR MANY YEARS IF YOU REALLY WORK AT IT THOUGH YOU COULD GET TO A POINT WHERE YOU COULD WORK ON THINGS YOU WANT TO DO MAYBE YOU COULD EVEN ENACT SOME CHANGES IN THE SYSTEM ITSELF

ANYWAY THAT'S MY SPIEL NO ONE EVER SAID LIFE IS EASY IT ISN'T GIVING UP BECAUSE IT'S NOT HANDED TO YOU ON A SILVER PLATTER IS YOUR CHOICE IT MAY WELL BE THE BEST CHOICE FOR YOU MORE POWER TO YOU BUT THE FACT IS THERE ARE WAYS TO ACHIEVE YOUR GOALS WITHIN THIS SYSTEM IF YOU HAD THE DRIVE AND DETERMINATION TO DO IT
I USED TO WANT TO BECOME A SCIENTIST UNTIL I LEARNED ABOUT THIS I WAS VERY INTERESTED IN DOING WORK THAT WOULD PROVE A LOT OF OUR CURRENT THEORIES WRONG THAT IS AFTER ALL HOW SCIENCE ADVANCES THE QUICKEST BUT CLEARLY THIS SORT OF STRUCTURE DOES NOT ALLOW FOR ANYONE LIKE ME SO I'VE SETTLED ON BEING AN ENGINEER BECAUSE IN GENERAL NOBODY CARES WHETHER OR NOT WE DO SOMETHING ACCORDING TO THE NORM JUST THAT IT WORKS BETTER THAN THE PREVIOUS THING
VERY GOOD ARTICLE ON THE SAME TOPIC

THESE DAYS SCIENTISTS SPEND MUCH OF THEIR TIME TAKING PROFESSIONAL SELFIES EFFECTIVELY SPENDING MORE TIME ANNOUNCING IDEAS THAN FORMULATING THEM



ACADEMIA HAS LARGELY BECOME A FACTORY
DUH I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT PLASMA PHYSICS IS A DYING FIELD THE SITUATION ISN'T QUITE AS BAD IN OTHER FIELDS BUT THE SAME PRESSURES STILL EXIST

ONE THING I WANT TO CORRECT SLIGHTLY IS THAT THEY DON'T JUST CARE ABOUT NUMBER OF PAPERS THEY ALSO CARE ABOUT CITATIONS AND QUALITY OF JOURNALS
I DID A BS IN PHYSICS AT AN INSTITUTION WITH A HEALTHY PLASMA GROUP A GREAT DEAL OF THAT RESEARCH HAPPENS AT A FACILITY AND UNIVERSITY WITH A RESTRICTIVE PATENT POLICY INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP
SO PLASMA ALREADY IS A HARD FIELD TO GET GOOD LONG-TERM FUNDING AND THEN YOU ADD TO IT THAT CORPORATE PARTNERS RISK NOT ACTUALLY GETTING RIGHTS OUT OF VIABLE RESEARCH
YOUR THOUGHTS MIRROR MINE FORTUNATELY I DROPPED OUT OF GRAD SCHOOL IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF MY PHD NEVER LOOKING BACK
IF I WERE A VERY SMART AND DRIVEN PERSON I WOULD PROBABLY MAKE IT REGARDLESS OF THE SYSTEM IN PLACE BUT I'M NOT

THIS RESONATED WITH ME AND I DROPPED OUT OF GRAD SCHOOL BECAUSE I WORK WITH AND AM FRIENDS THESE SMART AND DRIVEN PEOPLE BUT I DON'T SHARE THEIR PASSION TO DELVE INTO THE NUANCES HOWEVER I DO HAVE A PASSION TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE HIGHEST QUALITY DATA AVAILABLE FOR THEIR RESEARCH BUT THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE ME HAVING A PHD LUCKILY THE FEW LARGE-SCALE RESEARCH PROJECTS I WORK ON ARE WELL FUNDED LONG-TERM BECAUSE THE PI IS AS GOOD OF A SALESMAN AS HE IS A SCIENTIST BUT I HEAR SO MUCH TALK ABOUT FROM THE JUNIOR SCIENTISTS AND OTHER COLLABORATORS THAT TO ME IT SOUNDS LIKE THEIR PRIMARY CONCERN MORE SO THAN THE SCIENCE
THIS IS NEARLY THE REASON I LEFT GRAD SCHOOL TO START WORKING IN ANOTHER FIELD I'D WORKED WITH MANY PROFESSORS WHILE IN GRAD AND UNDERGRAD AND THE WHOLE PROCESS FOR GETTING FUNDED SEEMED TOO PAINFUL TO SUBJECT MYSELF TO
A RELATED ARTICLE KIND OF ABOUT THE SAME PROBLEM

TOPIC
I RECOGNIZE THIS VERY WELL FROM HOW IT WORKS HERE IN SWEDEN I TERMINATED MY POST GRADUATE STUDIES AT A LATE STAGE BECAUSE I HAD DIRECTED MY RESEARCH TOWARDS NOVEL IDEAS AND LONG ODDS AND NEGATIVE RESULTS CAN'T BE PUBLISHED SO I FIGURATIVELY PERISHED NOW I AM A TECHNICIAN IN A PHARMACEUTICAL FACTORY BORING WORK BUT STEADY PAY
THIS IS EXACTLY WHY I APPLIED TO A PH D PROGRAM THEN DECIDED NOT TO GO BACK I'M GETTING PAID MORE CURRENTLY TO DEAL WITH A POLITICAL SYSTEM THAT I ALREADY UNDERSTAND THERE WAS NO REASON TO TAKE A PAY CUT SIMPLY TO STUDY THE FIELD I LOVE WHILE BEING SMASHED DOWN BY ASSHOLES WITH CORPORATE ABILITY
DAMN THAT SUCKS I KNOW A FEW OF THE FORMER STUDENTS FROM MY GROUP FINISHED THEIR POSTDOCS AND TRANSITIONED INTO FINANCE POSITIONS INSTEAD FOR SIMILAR REASONS IT'S PRETTY EASY TO GET DISILLUSIONED BY THE SYSTEM ESPECIALLY WHEN GRANT WRITING GOES FROM NO NO IT'S NOT FOR ITER TO O YES YES THIS IS IN SUPPORT OF ITER FOR PURELY POLITICAL REASONS WITHOUT THE ACTUAL SCIENCE CHANGING
IF WE REALLY WANT RESULTS THEN WE NEED BORED SCIENTISTS NOTHING I REPEAT NOTHING IS MORE PRODUCTIVE THAN A BORED SCIENTIST
ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY COLLUSION BETWEEN THESE GRANT REVIEWERS AND THE GRANTEES MAYBE A QUID PRO QUO IF THEY GIVE ME A HIGH SCORE I'LL HELP THEM ON FUTURE PROPOSALS
THE WAY GRANT REVIEW PANELS WORK IS THAT THEY RE TRYING TO JUDGE A PROPOSAL BASICALLY ON TWO THINGS IMPACT ON THE FIELD AND LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS THESE TWO THINGS ARE USUALLY INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO EACH OTHER

SO THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY WOULD BE INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL IF EVERYONE WAS STARTING FROM GROUND ZERO BUT THEY'RE NOT

TAKE TWO PROPOSALS BOTH WITH SOLID IDEAS FOR MAJOR IMPACT WHICH DO YOU PICK THE ONE MOST LIKELY TO ACTUALLY WORK THIS ENTIRELY MAKES SENSE SO AS A GRANT WRITER HOW DO YOU DO THIS HOW DO YOU MAKE YOUR WORK APPEAR MORE LIKELY TO SUCCEED OBVIOUS DO SOME OF IT FIRST SO YOU CAN PRESENT THE DATA THAT SHOWS IT WILL WORK BECAUSE YOU'VE ALREADY DONE PART OF IT

NOT THAT THIS IS PARTICULARLY GOOD BUT I DON'T REALLY SEE A BETTER SOLUTION HERE WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO DO SCIENCE THAN WE CAN ARE ALLOCATING MONEY TO PAY FOR WHICH MEANS EVERYONE HAS TO STRUGGLE TO STAY AFLOAT RATHER THAN GETTING TO DO WORK
REMINDME DAYS
QUESTION YOU TALK ABOUT IT AS BEING A PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY A LOT WHAT ARE THEY DOING IN OTHER COUNTRIES ARE SOME OF THEIR SYSTEMS BETTER AND HOW DID DO THEY ACCOMPLISH THAT
IF YOU DON'T LIKE A SYSTEM WHERE THE GUYS WHO MOVE UP THE CHAIN ARE CORPORATE GUYS RATHER THAN GUYS WITH REAL SUBSTANCE THEN I'M AFRAID YOU'RE IN FOR AN EVEN BIGGER SURPRISE WHEN YOU START WORKING IN INDUSTRY

MY WIFE IS IN A SCIENTIFIC FIELD WORKS IN A LAB AT A RESEARCH UNIVERSITY AND HAS A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN SCIENCE SHE'S EXPLAINED THIS EXACT PROBLEM TO ME SO MANY TIMES ITS A HUGE PROBLEM HER BOSS DID GET TENURE BUT EVEN AFTER THAT ITS STILL A STRUGGLE FOR GRANTS BASICALLY FOR THE REST OF HIS CAREER GOTTA KEEP WRITING TO GET THOSE SWEET SWEET GRANTS IT TURNED HER OFF GETTING HER PHD SEEING HOW MUCH STRESS WAS INVOLVED
THIS WAS WRITTEN ALMOST YEARS AGO HETP HINT IT WAS ALREADY WAY TOO CORPORATE AND HIERARCHICAL
THE CULPRIT IS TECHNOLOGY
MPH EVENTUALLY THE WORLD RUNS OUT OF FRUIT AND IF EACH PERSON IS REQUIRED TO PUBLISH 2 ARTICLES A YEAR TO KEEP A JOB OR GO TO GRADUATE SCHOOL OR WHATEVER THOSE PAPERS EVENTUALLY BECOME GARBAGE IF THEY WANT TO PRETEND THEY ADD TO THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE

PERHAPS ALL BREAKTHROUGHS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS OVER THE PAST YEARS HAVE ALL BEEN MATHEMATICAL NONSENSE

THE WORLD IS SIMPLY RUNNING OUT OF JOBS TO DO THAT'S ALL
IN OUR SYSTEM SCIENCE HAS BECOME AN ARM OF THE CAPITALIST PROFIT SYSTEM IN THE U SOUTH THERE IS A JOKE IN MY DEPARTMENT AMONG US CONDENSED MATTER PEOPLE HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY YOUR GRANT QUANTUM COMPUTERS HIGH TEMP SUPER CONDUCTIVITY OR IT COULD MAKE A DEVICE

EVERYTHING WE STUDY HAS TO HAVE SOME SORT OF JUSTIFICATION ALONG THE LINES OF POSSIBLY MAKING A DEVICE THAT SOMEONE CAN SELL TO CONSUMERS WHICH BY IN LARGE HAD LEFT THE HET DEPARTMENT MOSTLY GRAINLESS

THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT HET OR FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS DOESN'T GET GRANTS BUT THE MOST SUCCESSFUL IE MOST FUNDED PROFESSORS DO DEVICE PHYSICS

OUR GOVERNMENT EXISTS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE WHY ARE WE SURPRISED WHEN THE SAME TENDENCY EXISTS IN GOVERNMENT FUNDING

I COULD GO ON BUT I'M ON MY PHONE AT THE DMV
I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THIS POST I SORT OF HAD A GLIMMER WHEN I WAS IN GRAD SCHOOL BUT REALLY DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE DEPTH OF THE ROT UNTIL I STARTED MY OWN POSTHOC RUN FOR YOUR LIFE THIS STRUCTURE WILL EVENTUALLY COLLAPSE
DUDE GET OUT

WHY WASTE YOUR TIME IF YOU WORK IN PHYSICS WHEN ENERGY HITS AN UPSWING YOU COULD WORK ON A RESERVOIR TEAM MAKING PLUS OR MORE A MONTH

AND THEN HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST THAT CASH FLOW OR YOU COULD WASTE YOUR TIME IN ACADEMIC CIRCLE JERK OR GO PRIVATE AND MAKE MONEY

GO MAKE AND RETIRE YOUNGISH WHILE YOU STILL CAN DOES ALL THAT SHIT MATTER WHEN YOU DEAD NO MATTER WHAT YOU CONTRIBUTE NOPE NONE OF IT MAKE YOUR MONEY

DO THE THINGS YOU LOVE ONCE YOU HAVE SEIZED YOUR CASH FLOW
SUCH A SAD ERA OUR SCIENTISTS ARE MORE WORRIED ABOUT FUNDING AND SPEND SUCH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME CHASING IT THAN EXPLORING ACTUAL SCIENCE
NOT JUST SATIRE ANYMORE
YOU WILL BE HIRED BY LEX AUTHOR TO HELP HIM BUILD HIS EVIL EMPIRE
THIS ALL SOUNDS LIKE A TYPICAL SYSTEM WITHOUT A MEMORY AND FEEDBACK ENABLED BECAUSE NORMALLY WHEN PEOPLE MAKE FALSE CLAIMS AND THEY GET TESTED AND FAIL THEY WOULD GET PUNISHED IN THIS CASE FUNDING AND STATUS GET REVOKED

NOW HERE THIS FAILS BECAUSE THE PROBLEM NEVER GETS TO SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY OR WAY OUTSIDE THE LIFETIME OF THE RESEARCHER YEARS FROM DISCOVERY TO IMPLEMENTATION FUNDERS DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE PROBLEM OR THE SCIENTIST THAT FAILED HAVE MORE MONEY THAT KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH IT CAN'T SAY OH THERE IS NO GOOD PROJECTS IN FIELD X SO LETS REDIRECT MONEY TO FIELD Y GRANT GIVER ARE NOT QUALIFIED OR SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE TO JUDGE A GRANT PROPOSAL

SO INSTEAD YOU GET ADHORT SOLUTIONS LIKE NUMBER OF CITATIONS ON A PAPER IMPACT NUMBER OF PAPER PUBLISHED ALL WHICH AFFECT FUTURE FUNDING SINCE IT'S LIMITED AMOUNT OF FUNDING YOU NEED TO STAND OUT TO GET THE GRANTS

SO HOW DO WE PUNISH PEOPLE WHO OVER HYPE THEIR RESULTS AND FUTURE ARTICLES REPUTATION OF SCIENTISTS WITH RESPECT TO NOT ONLY COMPLETED RESEARCH BUT DIFFICULTY OF RESEARCH WHERE DO YOU STOP A RESEARCH TO RECUPERATE COSTS MOST LIKELY WON'T BE POSSIBLE BECAUSE YOU RENT LABS WITH A SCHEDULE

IDEAS
JUST WANTED TO SAY I FEEL INCREDIBLY LUCKY GETTING A POSITION AT A TOP UNIVERSITY WITH PUBLISHED PAPERS
THAT'S WAY TOO OPEN ENDED COULD YOU CLARIFY WHICH COUNTRY YOU WANT TO STUDY IN WHAT LEVEL YOU WANT TO STUDY AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN YOUR PARENTS TOWN OR MIT AND WHAT QUALIFICATIONS YOU ALREADY HAVE ARE WORKING TOWARDS HAVE YOU JUST FINISHED A MASTERS AND WANT TO GET A PHD OR ARE YOU APPLYING TO UNDERGRAD IF YOU GIVE US THIS INFORMATION PEOPLE WILL BE A LOT MORE WILLING AND ABLE TO HELP

EDIT SPELLING
EDISON AND TESLA YOU COULDN'T THINK OF ANYONE MORE CURRENT THAN THAT
HMM NEEDS MORE WORK

EDISON TESLA AND EINSTEIN WALK INTO A BAR

TESLA TO WAITER IT'S QUITE HOT IN HERE CAN YOU SWITCH ON THE AC PLEASE

EDISON NOT THAT TOPIC AGAIN
EDISON TESLA AND EINSTEIN WALK INTO A BAR BARTENDER SAYS WHAT IS THIS SOME KIND OF JOKE
WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE THOSE TWO

I LIKE THIS ONE FROM R JOKES

TESLA FORD AND EDISON WERE ALL STANDING ON A STAGE PRESENTING THEIR LATEST FINDINGS

TESLA STROLLED FORWARD AND ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD INVENTED A BRAND NEW WAY TO TRANSMIT ENERGY THROUGH THE AIR THE CROWD CLAPPED POLITELY

FORD WAS NEXT AND PULLED THE COVER OFF A LARGE ENGINE HE HAD DISCOVERED A WAY TO CREATE HORSELESS CARRIAGES THE CROWD GASPED AND CLAPPED LOUDER

EDISON TOOK TWO STEPS TO THE LEFT AND THREW UP HIS ARMS TO ANNOUNCE THAT HE HAD INVENTED A REVOLUTIONARY NEW WAY TO SEND ELECTRICITY THROUGH THE VERY AIR THE CROWD WENT WILD
YOU KNOW IT HELP IF WE KNEW WHY IT WAS EINSTEIN TESLA AND EDISON THAT WALK INTO A BAR YOU SAY YOUR SCRIPT REQUIRES IT SO WHY DOES IT AND ARE THEY ALREADY ARGUING WHEN THEY WALK IN ARE THEY HOSTILE EXHAUSTED LOOKING TO GET DRUNK AFTER SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENED
DO YOU THINK THAT IT'S THE RIGHT CHOICE

HONESTLY DOES IT MATTER I MEAN WHAT SORT OF THING COULD SOMEONE POTENTIALLY TELL YOU HERE THAT WOULD CHANGE YOUR MIND ABOUT THIS PROGRAM
YRS OLD FELLAS HERE STARTED MY UNDERGRAD

IT'S A GOOD CHOICE ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU DO PROGRAMMING PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES JUST NEVER GIVE UP

RE EMPLOYMENT IN NEW SECTOR IS HARDER BUT STILL POSSIBLE EVE INTO OUR ACCORDING TO STATISTICS

CONSIDER FOR INSTANCE DATA SCIENTIST PAYS HUGE
THIS IS A QUITE INVOLVED QUESTION OBVIOUSLY REQUIRING QUITE A BIT MORE THAN HIGH SCHOOL PHYSICS FOR ANY SORT OF PROPER ANSWER I'M ALSO SURE IT'S BEEN ASKED MANY TIMES BEFORE BUT I'LL TRY TO GIVE ONE ANSWER REGARDLESS

BASICALLY THE ISSUE IS THAT WHEN YOU TRY TO TREAT GENERAL RELATIVITY AS A QUANTUM THEORY YOU TRY TO QUANTIZE IT AS WE SAY YOU FIND THAT IT HAS UNCONTROLLABLE INFINITIES TECHNICAL TERM IS AS OPPOSED TO RENORMALIZABLE WHICH ARE THE THEORIES THAT ONLY HAVE CONTROLLABLE INFINITES I EAST THE OTHER FORCES EXACTLY HOW AND THE TECHNICAL REASON WHY IS A BIT TECHNICAL SO WE CAN'T GET A REASONABLE QUANTUM THEORY IN THE SAME WAY AS WE CAN FOR THE OTHER FORCES AT THIS LEVEL IT'S JUST A MATHEMATICAL FACT AND IT TELLS US THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK FOR SOME OTHER THEORY OF GRAVITY


THERE ARE VARIOUS CONCEPTUAL REASONS BEHIND WHY GRAVITY SHOULD BE SOMEHOW DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER FORCES AS WELL FOR EXAMPLE GRAVITY CHANGES THE SHAPE OF SPACETIME MEANING THAT IN A QUANTUM THEORY OF GRAVITY SPACETIME ITSELF CAN AND WILL BE IN SOME QUANTUM STATE WHAT DOES LOCALITY REALLY MEAN IN THIS CASE YOU CAN'T REALLY DEFINE IT ACTUALLY AND A THEORY OF QUANTUM GRAVITY SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY LOCAL OBSERVABLES SOMETHING THAT WE IN THE OTHER THEORIES CONSIDER FUNDAMENTAL THIS GIVES A BIG HINT THAT WE NEED SOMETHING A BIT DIFFERENT

THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON IS THAT ALL THE OTHER FORCES ARE QUANTIZED ON TOP OF A SPACETIME FRAMEWORK GRAVITY IS THE SPACETIME FRAMEWORK
I WANTED TO CHIME INTO THIS THREAD SINCE YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN THAT MANY RESPONSES AND THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS TO LOOK AT THIS I ALSO WANTED TO PROVIDE A MORE ANSWER BUT ONE WHICH GIVES YOU A SENSE OF THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM


THE ENERGY SCALE VIEWPOINT

ONE IMPORTANT ATTRIBUTE OF SUCCESSFUL MODELS IS THAT THEIR DESCRIPTION OF PARTICLE INTERACTIONS VARIES WITH ENERGY SCALE THIS PROPERTY IS KNOWN AS A RUNNING COUPLING CONSTANT YOU CAN THINK OF THIS AS A FUNDAMENTAL INPUT TO CALCULATIONS OF PARTICLE INTERACTION ONE OF THE WAYS IS TO THINK ABOUT THESE THEORIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE FORCES FIELDS IS IN TERMS OF A MATHEMATICAL OBJECT CALLED FIXED POINTS TYPICALLY IN LITERATURE YOU WILL HEAR THE TERMS IR INFRARED FIXED POINT AND UV ULTRAVIOLET FIXED POINT THESE ARE SOMEWHAT FANCY MATHEMATICAL CONCEPTS THAT MEAN

AT LOWER AND LOWER ENERGIES RESP LARGE DISTANCES THE THEORY BEHAVES A CERTAIN WAY BUT WE SELECT A PARTICULAR ENERGY SCALE AT SOME LOW ENERGY AND CUTOFF OUR CALCULATIONS AT THE IR FIXED POINT

AT HIGHER AND HIGHER ENERGIES RESP SHORT DISTANCES THE THEORY BEHAVES SOME CERTAIN WAY BUT WE SELECT A PARTICULAR ENERGY SCALE AT SOME HIGH ENERGY AND CUTOFF OUR CALCULATIONS AT THE UV FIXED POINT

IN OTHER WORDS IN THE STANDARD MODEL YOU DON'T HAVE AN ABSOLUTE DESCRIPTION INTERACTIONS OVER ALL POSSIBLE ENERGIES INSTEAD WE DESCRIBE INTERACTIONS AS THE EVOLVE FROM HIGH TO LOW ENERGIES OR FROM LOW TO HIGH ENERGIES AND THE MODEL CORRECTLY DESCRIBES WHAT HAPPENS IN THE MIDDLE

SO WHERE DOES THIS LEAVE US WELL OUR MODELS OF QUANTUM PHYSICS DESCRIBE HOW THINGS BEHAVE DOWN TO A FEW ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE LIGHTER THAN OUR LIGHTEST PARTICLES ELECTRONS OR NEUTRINOS DEPENDING ON YOUR PREFERENCE AND THEY DESCRIBE HOW THINGS BEHAVE UP TO A FEW ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE HEAVIER THAN OUR HEAVIEST PARTICLE THE TOP QUARK THE W AND Z BOSONS OR THE HIGGS DEPENDING ON PREFERENCE BEYOND THESE REGIONS OUR MODELS ARE NOT PREDICTIVE OR YOU COULD TRY TO MAKE THEM BE PREDICTIVE AND YOU'LL ESSENTIALLY ASSERT THERE IS NO OTHER PARTICLE CONTENT OUTSIDE OF THESE ENERGY SCALES

IN OTHER WORDS OUR MODELS DESCRIBE HOW THINGS BEHAVE

DOWN TO THE LENGTH ENERGY SCALE CORRESPONDING TO EV
UP TO THE LENGTH ENERGY SCALE CORRESPONDING TO TV OR EV

THIS IS VERY GOOD AND RATHER AMAZING IT'S ALMOST ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE

HOWEVER INSIDE THESE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE GRAVITY HAS ALMOST NO EFFECT WE KNOW OF AN ENERGY SCALE WHERE GRAVITY OUGHT TO HAVE THE SAME RELATIVE STRENGTH OF THE OTHER PARTICLE INTERACTIONS THE PLANCK SCALE TO BE TECHNICALLY CORRECT THE FIRST FEW ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE SMALLER LARGER REMEMBER THAT HIGHER ENERGIES RESP SHORTER DISTANCES ARE NOT SENSIBLE THAN THE PLANCK WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US WELL OUR THEORY DESCRIBES THINGS

EV DOWN TO THIS ENERGY SCALE
EV TV UP TO THIS ENERGY SCALE
EV OR TV GRAVITY ONLY BECOMES EQUALLY RELEVANT OR EQUALLY POWERFUL IF YOU LIKE HERE NEAR THE PLANCK ENERGY

SO WHILE OUR VERY AWESOME AND IMPRESSIVE THEORY COVERS ALMOST ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE GRAVITY IS STILL ORDERS AWAY FROM THE HIGHEST ENERGY RESP SHORTEST DISTANCE WE CAN DESCRIBE


THE COUPLING CONSTANT VIEWPOINT

ANOTHER WAY TO LOOK AT THIS PROBLEM IS THROUGH COUPLING CONSTANTS THIS HAS BEEN A LONG RESPONSE SO I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY TO FULLY DESCRIBE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF COUPLING CONSTANTS AND WHAT THEY MEAN AND HOW THEY ARE USED THEY ARE USED EVERYWHERE IN QUANTUM FIELDS BUT EVEN WITHOUT MUCH DETAIL A SIMPLE GLANCE AT NUMERICAL VALUES FOR THE SEVERAL FORCES CAN BE DESCRIPTIVE

I A KING A THE FINE STRUCTURE CONSTANT IS FAMOUSLY AT LOW ENERGY APPROXIMATELY BUT NOT EXACTLY MR EDDINGTON FOR OUR PURPOSES 2 WILL DO
I THE ELECTROWEAK COUPLING CONSTANT IS ABOUT
I THE CD COUPLING CONSTANT IS ABOUT REALLY IT'S ABOUT BUT IT'S ORDER THE CLOSENESS OF THIS CONSTANT TO HAS DEEP MEANING BUT I WON'T DISCUSS IT FURTHER UNLESS ASKED

OK TO SUMMARIZE WE HAVE SORTED THIS TIME

I
I 2
I

AND WHERE IS GRAVITY HERE

NOT AGAIN GRAVITATION IS TOTALLY OFF THE SCALE LOW I MEAN WE'RE TALKING ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE WEAKER THAN ELECTROMAGNETISM AND STILL ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE WEAKER THAN OUR WEAKEST FORCE PHYSICALLY THIS MEANS IF YOU PLACED TWO TEST PARTICLES ELECTRONS APART BY A SOME DISTANCE THE ELECTROMAGNETIC REPULSIVE IN THIS CASE EFFECTS WOULD BE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE STRONGER THAN THE ATTRACTIVE IN ALL CASES FORCE OF GRAVITY

IF THIS SITUATION WEREN'T BAD ENOUGH THERE IS ONE OTHER GLARING DIFFERENCE THE FIRST THREE STRUCTURE CONSTANTS WERE DIMENSIONLESS PHYSICAL CONSTANTS THEY ARE JUST NUMBERS THESE PLAY VERY IMPORTANT ROLES IN PHYSICS AND THEY ARE SPECIAL BECAUSE THEY LACK A CERTAIN KIND OF DIMENSION UNIT BIAS THAT DIMENSIONAL CONSTANTS CAN HAVE IN OTHER WORDS WE CAN EXPECT THAT AN ALIEN WOULD DERIVE THE SAME VALUES FOR DIMENSIONLESS CONSTANTS BUT WE WOULD HAVE TO CORRECT FOR DIMENSIONAL ONES BUT THE GRAVITATIONAL CONSTANT IS NOT DIMENSIONLESS THIS IS A BIG DEAL AND IS VERY MUCH A STOPPING POINT FOR UNIFICATION OF FORCES THIS FACT HAS OTHER IMPLICATIONS BUT I CAN'T FIND A GOOD REFERENCE FOR IT NOW THIS MIGHT SUFFICE BUT I DOUBT IT

I HOPE THIS HAS BEEN HELPFUL IF ANYONE HAS ERRORS QUESTIONS PLEASE LET ME KNOW SO I CAN CORRECT AMEND MY RESPONSE


EXPANDING ON ANOTHER COMMENT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WE HAVE IS THAT THE TWO THEORIES QUANTUM MECHANICS AND GENERAL RELATIVITY ARE BUILT ON TWO DIFFERENT AND COMPLETELY INCOMPATIBLE SCHEMES QUANTUM MECHANICS IS CALLED BACKGROUND DEPENDENT GENERAL RELATIVITY IS BACKGROUND INDEPENDENT BASICALLY THIS MEANS THAT WHEN QUANTUM THEORIES ARE FORMULATED THEY START BY ARBITRARILY DEFINING A SPACE-TIME BACKGROUND WITHIN WHICH EVERYTHING IS MEASURED GENERAL RELATIVITY ON THE OTHER HAND IS BACKGROUND INDEPENDENT BECAUSE THE OBJECTS INTERACTING INFLUENCE THE SPACE-TIME METRIC ITSELF IN QUANTUM THEORY SPACE-TIME IS ABSOLUTE AND UNCHANGING WHILE IN RELATIVITY SPACE-TIME IS DYNAMIC AND HAS SOME OF IT'S BASIC PROPERTIES SET BY THE INTERACTING OBJECTS ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING IDEAS IN PHYSICS IS THAT SPACE AND TIME MAY NOT BE FUNDAMENTAL ENTITIES IN OUR UNIVERSE BUT ARE EMERGENT PROPERTIES DEFINED BY THE INTERACTIONS OF THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE UNIVERSE ON THE VERY FOREFRONT OF INVESTIGATION IN THIS AREA IS SOMETHING THAT YOU SHOULD LOOK UP THE AMPLITUHEDRON


I HAVEN'T STUDIED THIS IN ANY GREAT DETAIL BUT I THINK THE BASIC IDEA IS THAT GRAVITY IS SO MUCH WEAKER THAN THE OTHER FORCES ON SHORT SCALES
THINK ABOUT THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCES BETWEEN TWO PIECES OF METAL IT'S PRETTY WEAK AND COMPLETELY NEGLIGIBLE IN MOST IF NOT ALL PHYSICAL MODELS NOW IMAGINE IF THOSE PIECES WERE MAGNETISED THE ATTRACTIVE FORCE BETWEEN THEM WOULD BE MUCH STRONGER I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE MATHS OF IT FIRST YEAR UNDERGRAD HERE BUT I BELIEVE THAT THAT'S THE MAIN REASON THAT IT'S BEEN SO DIFFICULT BECAUSE THEY BEHAVE SO DIFFERENTLY

SUMMARY

WE OBSERVED THAT THE DRAGONFLY SPECIES SYMPETRUM FLAVEOLUM SOUTH STRIOLATUM SOUTH SANGUINEOUS SOUTH MERIDIONALE AND SOUTH DANAE WERE ATTRACTED BY POLISHED BLACK GRAVESTONES IN A HUNGARIAN CEMETERY

2 THE INSECTS SHOWED THE SAME BEHAVIOUR AS AT WATER I THEY PERCHED PERSISTENTLY IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF THE CHOSEN GRAVESTONES AND DEFENDED THEIR PERCH AGAINST OTHER DRAGONFLIES II FLYING INDIVIDUALS REPEATEDLY TOUCHED THE HORIZONTAL SURFACE OF THE SHINY BLACK TOMBSTONES WITH THE VENTRAL SIDE OF THEIR BODY III PAIRS IN TANDEM POSITION FREQUENTLY CIRCLED ABOVE BLACK GRAVESTONES

TOMBSTONES PREFERRED BY THE DRAGONFLIES WERE IN THE OPEN AND HAD AN AREA OF AT LEAST WITH AN ALMOST HORIZONTAL POLISHED BLACK SURFACE AND WITH AT LEAST ONE PERCH IN THEIR IMMEDIATE VICINITY

USING IMAGING POLARIMETRY WE FOUND THAT THE BLACK GRAVESTONES LIKE SMOOTH WATER SURFACES REFLECT HIGHLY AND HORIZONTALLY POLARIZED LIGHT

IN FIELD EXPERIMENTS WITH VARIOUS TEST SURFACES WE SHOWED THAT THE DRAGONFLIES ATTRACTED TO SHINY BLACK TOMBSTONES DISPLAY POSITIVE POLAROTAXIS AND UNDER NATURAL CONDITIONS DETECT WATER BY MEANS OF THE HORIZONTALLY POLARIZED REFLECTED LIGHT THIS AND THE CHARACTERISTICS OF BLACK GRAVESTONES EXPLAIN WHY THESE DRAGONFLIES ARE ATTRACTED TO BLACK TOMBSTONES

IF FEMALES ATTRACTED TO THE BLACK GRAVESTONES OVIPOSIT ON THEM THE LATTER CONSTITUTE ECOLOGICAL TRAPS FOR DRAGONFLIES THAT ARE NOT CLOSE TO WATER

FOR THE MATHEMATICS SIDE I'D TRY TO GET A HOLD OF MATHEMATICAL METHODS FOR PHYSICISTS AND ENGINEERS DON'T BE PUT OFF BY THE ENGINEER BIT THIS BOOK HAS NEARLY ALL OF THE MATHEMATICS YOU'LL NEED UP TO MASTERS LEVEL
HERE IS A VIDEO ABOUT IT
THIS RECENT PAPER SOOOOOORT OF TOUCHES ON WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
THEN IT COULD BE ABLE TO FORM BLACK HOLES

UNLIKELY IT WOULD NEED SOME PROCESS TO ACCUMULATE ON SMALLER SCALES AND THERE ARE UPPER LIMITS ON OF DARK MATTER

BLACK HOLES DO NOT CARE ABOUT HOW THEY FORMED NO MATTER WHAT WENT IN THEY HAVE THE SAME PROPERTIES ONLY CHARGE SPIN AND OVERALL ENERGY ARE RELEVANT NEGLECTING POSSIBLE QUANTUM EFFECTS IF DARK MATTER COULD FORM BLACK HOLES THOSE WOULD BE IDENTICAL TO BLACK HOLES WHICH FORMED FROM REGULAR MATTER

BUT THE INFALLING MATTER WOULD GATHER IN A RELATIVELY VACANT QUANTUM WELL DEFINED ONLY BY GRAVITY THE PERFECT MERGE OF QUANTUM PHYSICS AND GENERAL RELATIVITY

THAT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE AT ALL
WHAT ARE QUANTUM STATES IN GRAVITY CONFINEMENT OF COURSE BEING IN A BLACK HOLE THEY ARE UNOBSERVABLE

HOWEVER IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO FIND A DEEP BUT NOT YET BLACK WELL IN DARK MATTER WHICH CONFINES PARTICLES IN A FINITE SPACE WHEN THEY EXCITE AND DE-EXCITE WHAT IS THE RADIATION SPECTRUM CAN WE OBSERVE SUCH A RADIATION PATTERN

EDIT REMOVED A LINE

THE IDEA IS THAT THE DARK MATTER FORMS THE GRAVITY WELL BUT DOES NOT INTERACT IN ANY OTHER WAY WITH NORMAL MATTER
GRAVITY IS AN INERTIAL FORCE CAN BE MADE TO DISAPPEAR AT ANY GIVEN POINT WITH A COORDINATE CHANGE JUST LIKE THE CENTRIFUGAL CORIOLIS ETC FORCES INERTIAL FORCES ARE OFTEN CALLED FICTITIOUS BUT THAT'S A VERY DECEIVING WORD THEY ARE REAL FORCES

THE EM FORCE AND THE OTHER SM FORCES CAN BE WRITTEN IN SIMILAR BUT NOT IDENTICAL LANGUAGE IN TERMS OF THE CURVATURE OF A CERTAIN GEOMETRIC OBJECT CALLED A PRINCIPAL GAUGE BUNDLE CONTRAST WITH GRAVITY IN WHICH THE CURVATURE IS OF THE BACKGROUND SPACETIME ITSELF

IN A CERTAIN SENSE IT'S LIKE CHARGED PARTICLES MOVE OR LIE IN A CERTAIN INTERNAL SPACE ATTACHED AT ANY POINT IN SPACETIME WHICH CAN TWIST ABOUT AS YOU CHANGE POSITION IN THE LATTER THIS TWISTING BEING THE EM FIELD

IN K THEORY THIS IS LITERALLY BECAUSE THERE IS AN ACTUAL COMPACT EXTRA DIMENSION SURE SO THAT THE EM FORCE AND GRAVITY ARE ACTUALLY PART OF THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE AND THE TWISTING IS A LITERAL CURVATURE OF THE SPACETIME HOWEVER VANILLA K IS CERTAINLY WRONG IN OUR UNIVERSE IT MAKES PREDICTIONS THAT ARE NOT OBSERVED AS IT STANDS NOW IT'S NOT CORRECT TO TALK ABOUT GAUGE FORCES LIKE EM AS BEING LITERALLY THE SAME AS GRAVITY IF YOU WANT TO STAY FAITHFUL TO WHAT IS ACCEPTED PHYSICS K AND MORE SERIOUS MODERN DERIVATIVES ARE JUST TANTALIZING POSSIBILITIES FOR UNIFYING GRAVITY AND GAUGE THEORIES BUT IN MORE GENERAL THEORIES AT LOW ENERGY GRAVITY AND GAUGE THEORIES SPLIT AND ACT DIFFERENTLY
GRAVITY ISN'T FICTITIOUS SO NUMBER LEMME EXPLAIN

IN PHYSICS WE DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT FORCES WE CARE ABOUT INTERACTIONS BECAUSE IT'S MORE GENERAL AN INTERACTION IS ANY COUPLING BETWEEN TWO OBJECTS SUCH THAT THE EVOLUTION OF ONE DEPENDS ON THE OTHER IT CAN INCLUDE FORCES PUSHING THINGS AROUND BUT ALSO MUCH MORE FOR EXAMPLE THE COLOR INTERACTION STRONG NUCLEAR FORCE CAN TRANSFER COLOR BETWEEN QUARKS AND GLUONS THAT'S NOT A PUSH

GRAVITY IS AN INTERACTION BETWEEN ANY KIND OF OBJECT AND SPACETIME IT'S A COUPLING AS REAL AS ELECTROMAGNETISM

GRAVITY PUSHES THINGS AROUND BY WARPING SPACETIME AS AN INTERMEDIARY AND THIS IS DEPENDENT ON YOUR FRAME OF REFERENCE ELECTROMAGNETISM PUSHES THINGS AROUND USING THE PHOTON FIELD AS AN INTERMEDIARY AND THIS IS DEPENDENT ON YOUR CHOICE OF GAUGE HOW EXACTLY ARE THE TWO DIFFERENT

THE CONCEPT OF FICTITIOUS FORCE ONLY APPLIES AT THE MORE BASIC LEVELS OF PHYSICS LIKE LAWS AND SUCH THE TERM IS IRRELEVANT AT THE LEVEL OF FIELD THEORY
SUCH BEAUTIFUL PATTERNS

I WONDER WOULD THE CUMULATIVE FORCE OF THE IRON PARTICLES MIGRATING ALONG THE MAGNETIC FIELD BE CAPABLE OF PUSHING NEUTRAL PARTICLES THAT WERE ALSO IN SUSPENSION PRIOR TO PERTURBATION BY THE FIELD
THE PAPER IS REPORTED TO HAVE PASSED PEER REVIEW OVER AT NRL BUT IS NOT YET PUBLISHED THEIR IS ON ARXIV

ABS

THANKS TO U JMDUGAN FOR FIRST POSTING
HUH

THEY USE ROTATION VELOCITIES FOR THEIR ACCELERATION ESTIMATES LIKE EVERYONE ELSE IF OTHER RESEARCHERS USE THIS METHOD AND FIND LARGE DIFFERENCES IN THE DARK MATTER FRACTION OF DIFFERENT OBJECTS HOW CAN THEY FIND THE SAME RELATION IN ALL THEIR OBJECTS
THE KEY IS THAT LIGHT EMITTED BY STARS IS FAR MORE RELIABLE THAN FOR CONVERTING LIGHT TO MASS BELLI SAID

SO BEFORE REVIEWING THE ACTUAL PAPER IT APPEARS THAT WHAT SET THIS RELATION APART FROM THE RELATION INVOLVING INTRINSIC LUMINOSITY IS THAT THIS RELATION IS RESTRICTED TO LIGHT OF A PARTICULAR WAVELENGTH I'LL BE WATCHING TO SEE HOW WELL THIS HOLDS UP FOR OTHER GALAXIES AND CLUSTER PROFILES
I WONDER WHAT HAPPENS IF ONE APPLIES THIS MODEL TO THE BULLET CLUSTER
HAVING READ THE PAPER I AM NOT VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THEIR STATISTICAL PRACTICES IT ISN'T AT ALL BAYESIAN OR THE WAY THEY PRESENT THEIR CONCLUSIONS

ON THE STATISTICS SIDE THEY SAY
OF THE MANY RESOLVED POINTS ALONG THE ROTATION CURVES OF THESE GALAXIES WE REQUIRE A MINIMUM PRECISION OF IN VELOCITY THIS RETAINS DATA POINTS OUT OF DROPPING THIS LAST REQUIREMENT HAS NO AFFECT ON THE RESULT IT MERELY INCREASES THE SCATTER AS EXPECTED FOR LESS ACCURATE DATA

THAT REALLY ISN'T WHAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO DO YOU CAN'T JUST THROW AWAY DATA BECAUSE THE ERROR BARS AREN'T SMALL ENOUGH FOR YOUR LIKING ON TOP OF THAT PLENTY HAS BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT OUTLIERS OR HOW TO DEAL WITH MESSY DATA SEE HOGG BEVY PAPER THAT SHOULD REALLY BE A REQUIREMENT FOR ANYBODY IN THIS FIELD

IN THE DISCUSSION THEY STATE THAT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THESE RESULTS BEING THE END PRODUCT OF GALAXY FORMATION AREN'T SATISFACTORY BECAUSE COSMOLOGICAL SIMULATIONS CAN'T REPRODUCE REALISTIC GALAXIES IS A BIT OVERBLOWN AND REALLY COMES DOWN TO A MATTER OF PREFERENCE THE SIMS PEOPLE HAVE CAN'T REPRODUCE ACCURATE GALAXIES BUT ONE REASON FOR THAT IS A LIMITATION OF THE HARDWARE IF YOU WANT TO SIMULATE LARGE SCALES AND CAPTURE THINGS LIKE LENSING AND CLUSTERS THEN YOUR PARTICLE SIZE ISN'T SMALL ENOUGH TO RESOLVE GALAXY KINEMATICS IF YOU WANT TO SIMULATE GALAXY KINEMATICS THEN YOU CAN'T CORRECTLY ACCOUNT FOR THE INFLUENCES OF LARGE SCALE STRUCTURE JUST LAST WEEK THERE WAS A PAPER DISCUSSING HOW LARGE SCALE STRUCTURE AFFECTS HOW GALAXIES BEHAVE INTERNALLY AND ON TOP OF THAT THERE ARE STILL PLENTY OF ASTROPHYSICAL PHENOMENA THAT AREN'T WELL UNDERSTOOD AT ALL THAT REALLY PROBABLY DO CONTRIBUTE TO GALAXY BEHAVIOR SO DISMISSING THIS AS A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION IS JUST WAY TOO HASTY

IF NRL DECIDES TO PUBLISH THEN FINE THEY PUBLISH PLENTY OF PAPERS AND AT LEAST IT SERVES TO SPUR DISCUSSION BUT I WOULDN'T DRINK THE MOND JUST YET
HEADLINE ON EVERY MAJOR NEWS OUTLET TOMORROW SCIENTISTS PROVE DARK MATTER DOESN'T EXIST
I HAVE A HARD TIME TRUSTING THE IMPARTIALITY OF AUTHORS WITH AN ADDRESS OF EUCLID AVE ON MATTERS OF GENERAL RELATIVITY

JUST KIDDING BUT SERIOUSLY THANKS TO EVERYONE WHO HAS CONTRIBUTED IN THESE COMMENTS IT'S A HELPFUL DISCUSSION
AFTER SKIMMING THE PAPER IT APPEARS THAT THEY REDISCOVERED THAT MOND WORKS ON GALACTIC SCALES THEY FIND A NICE RELATION BETWEEN DARK MATTER AND REGULAR MATTER WHICH SEEMS TO REQUIRE A EXPLANATION HOWEVER THIS EXPLANATION MAY WELL BE THAT DARK MATTER INTERACTS WITH REGULAR MATTER VIA GRAVITATION
I'M CONFUSED IS THIS PAPER SAYING ROTATION CURVES OF DISK GALAXIES ARE PREDICTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY FLAT AS THEY ARE JUST BY DOING A MORE CAREFUL MEASUREMENT OF THE ORDINARY MATTER IN THEM THAN HAD BEEN DONE IN THE S I MEAN IF THE RESEARCHERS IN THE S HAD BEEN ABLE TO FIND ALL THE SAME MATTER THESE RESEARCHERS DO WOULD DARK MATTER HAVE EVER BEEN PROPOSED IF THE OBSERVED DYNAMICS OF GALAXIES IS FULLY EXPLAINED BY THE OBSERVABLE MATTER THEN WHY DOESN'T THE PAPER CONCLUDE DARK MATTER IS NOT REAL WHY WOULD THERE NEED TO BE ANY MODIFICATION OF GRAVITY OR OTHER EXPLANATION WHAT'S LEFT TO EXPLAIN
DELETED
IT'S TIME DEPENDANT YOUR BODY HAS THE ABILITY TO REPAIR AND MITIGATE EFFECTS OF SOME RADIATION WE'RE EXPOSED TO IT EVERY DAY AND EVEN MORE SO IF YOU FLY OR ARE AT HIGHER ELEVATIONS THERE IS A LIFETIME LIMIT ON IT IF YOU'RE WORKING WITH RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS THOUGH FOR LIABILITY REASONS
I'M LOOKING FOR BOOKS THAT ARE READABLE AND HAVE MORE OR LESS A CASUAL TONE BUT THAT WILL TEACH ME SOMETHING GOOD EXAMPLES WOULD THE FEYNMAN LECTURES OR AFT AND GR BOOKS OR NONLINEAR DYNAMICS AND CHAOS WHAT ARE SOME OTHER RESOURCES IN THE SAME VEIN
I'M LOOKING FOR A BOOK ABOUT FOURIER ANALYSIS WITH APPLICATIONS TO PHYSICS DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS
DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS ON PHYSICS TEXTS THAT ARE FORMULATED FROM A MATHEMATICALLY RIGOROUS POINT OF VIEW IDEALLY I'M LOOKING FOR THINGS SIMILAR TO DR FREDRICH SCHILLERS LECTURES AND METHOD OF EXPOSITING
HAVING A LOT OF TROUBLE IN MY UPPER LEVEL MECHANICS CLASSICAL THE TEXT USED IN THE CLASS IS JOHN BOOK BUT I WAS WONDERING IF ANYONE HAD ANY BETTER DIFFERENT RECOMMENDATIONS YOUTUBERS AND INTERNET SOURCES ARE ALSO WELCOME
ANY GOOD OPTICS BOOK THAT TALKS ABOUT CONCENTRATOR PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS

SO IF YOU DISREGARD THE LEADING CONTRIBUTION TO ENTROPY INCREASE YOU FIND THAT ENTROPY DOESN'T INCREASE ANYMORE I'M NOT SURE THIS IS A DEEP INSIGHT IT'S ALSO A COMPLETE NON SEQUITUR THAT THE LARGEST STORES OF ENTROPY WOULD HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THE LOCAL ARROW OF TIME OF COURSE THE LOCAL ARROW OF TIME WOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH A LOCAL INCREASE IN ENTROPY WHEN THE LOCAL ENTROPY FLOW IS ALSO ACCOUNTED FOR
THE IMPRESSION THAT I GOT OF MULLER FROM READING HIS MANY CONTRIBUTIONS ON QUORA IS THAT HE DOESN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND GENERAL RELATIVITY I WOULDN'T TRUST WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT THE NATURE OF TIME IF HE THINKS THAT IT REALLY DOES FREEZE AT THE EVENT HORIZON OF A BLACK HOLE A FALLACY UNDERSTOOD BY ANYONE WHO HAS TAKEN A CLASS IN GRAMMAR

SOURCE I STUDY GENERAL RELATIVITY AND HOW TO TEST CORRECTIONS TO GRAMMAR
ISN'T ENTROPY MORE A COMPASS OF TIME INSTEAD OF ARROW OF TIME DEFINER ANYWAY I MEAN YOU CAN USE THE MILKY WAY TO DEFINE AN ABSOLUTE REFERENCE FRAME UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT ETC OF THE UNIVERSE SETTING PREFERRED DIRECTIONS BUT CLAIMING DIRECTIONS EMERGE FROM THE MILKY WAY WOULD SEEM ABSURD ISN'T TIME JUST FLOWING WHILE WE USE LOCAL ENTROPY TO JUDGE IT'S DIRECTION SO TO SPEAK
TO BE HONEST THIS ARGUMENT IS REALLY STUPID IT'S NOT THAT AMOUNTS OF ENTROPY RADIATE MAGICAL ARROW OF TIME WAVES THAT MAKE THE WORLD GO IN THE RIGHT WAY THE MICROSTATE OF THE UNIVERSE ITSELF HAS AN ASYMMETRY THAT IS SUCH THAT THE THERMODYNAMIC LIMIT MOSTLY EXISTS THE ARROW OF TIME MANIFESTS AND THIS DESCENDS FROM THE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS ON THIS STATE ENTROPY IS A TOOL TO QUANTIFY THIS NOT THE ACTUAL REASON

IF A CERTAIN PIECE OF THE UNIVERSE BECOMES ISOLATED THIS DOES NOT STOP THE SUBSTATE STILL HAS THE SAME PROPERTY

THE SECOND PART ABOUT SPACETIME AND THE THE METRIC TENSOR OF THE VACUUM SORRY WHAT IS REALLY REALLY WEIRD
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT RICHARD MULLER IS ACTIVE ON QUORA IN FACT HE IS TAKING QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW FOR A LIVE ANSWER SESSION TODAY AT AM PDT

ASK QUESTIONS HERE

ANSWERED QUESTIONS HERE

I LIKE THE IDEA THAT THE FUTURE IS BEING CREATED INSTEAD OF IT EXISTING AND WE ARE JUST MOVING INTO IT
OK SO I THOUGHT I'D LIST SOME OF THE ANSWERS MULLER GIVES AT QUORA Q A SESSION THAT ESPECIALLY PERTAIN TO HIS NEW IDEAS ON TIME I'LL TRY TO KEEP THIS LIST UPDATED IF ANY PERTINENT NEW ANSWERS OCCUR FOR THE RECORD I HAVE NO ASSOCIATION WITH MULLER I'M SIMPLY INTERESTED IN WHAT THEORIES VARIOUS PHYSICISTS HAVE ON TIME

WHAT IS A SUMMARY OF YOUR NEW THEORY
WHAT ARE THE THEORIES YOU PRESENT IN YOUR NEW BOOK

THIS COMPLETELY EXPLAINS WHY MY WALLET IS NEVER IN MY BACKPACK THE FIRST AND SECOND TIMES I LOOK THERE BUT ON THE THIRD TIME IT IS THERE THANKS I HAVE ALWAYS SUSPECTED IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THIS
NOT A BIG DEAL

IF YOU CAN GIVE AN ESTIMATE FOR THE ACTIVITY OF THE SOURCE AND YOUR DISTANCE FROM THE SOURCE WHILE YOU WERE OUTSIDE THE SHIELDING IT'S STRAIGHTFORWARD TO CALCULATE THE DOSE YOU RECEIVED
IF THEY USE IT IN AN UNDERGRAD LAB IT'S PROBABLY SAFE AS LONG AS YOU DON'T EAT IT OR CARRY IT IN YOUR POCKET ALL DAY
NUMBER

THEY'RE NOT GOING TO LET UNDERGRADS HANDLE SOURCES THAT POSE A SERIOUS RISK FOR SHORT EXPOSURES

THE ADDED DOSE IS QUITE LIKELY LESS THAN THE EXTRA BACKGROUND DOSE YOU'D GET IF YOU LIVED AT A HIGHER ELEVATION
YOU'RE FINE THEY DON'T LET THE UNDERGRADS PLAY WITH IMPORTANT STUFF BUT THERE ARE RADIATION SAFETY RULES THAT UNIVERSITIES HAVE TO BE CAUTIOUS OF BECAUSE MINIMIZING EXPOSURE TO RADIATION IS A GOOD THING

YOU PROBABLY GET MORE EXPOSURE TO RADIATION DURING A CROSS-COUNTRY FLIGHT THAN YOU DID IN SECONDS
ALSO AS FAR AS LONG TERM SAFETY WORKING IN RAD LABS GOES THIS DUDE POSTED ABOVE MADE IT TO AND THEY HAD MINIMAL SECURITY AND UNDERSTANDING THEN SO IT'S POSSIBLE TO ESCAPE HEALTHY

TO WHAT EXTENT CAN A MATH PROFESSOR WORK WITH THE PHYSICS DEPARTMENT OF A UNIVERSITY I'M THINKING ABOUT GOING FOR A MATH PH D BUT I WOULDN'T MIND GETTING INVOLVED WITH COSMOLOGY AS WELL
I JUST STARTED A PH D IN A FAIRLY REPUTABLE PROGRAM TOP TOTAL TOP IN HEP THEORY I AM REALLY REALLY INTERESTED IN QUANTUM GRAVITY BUT IT'S BECOME APPARENT IN MY FIRST MONTH OR SO THAT THE COUPLE PROFS HERE THAT WORK IN IT ARE WELL BIG JERKS AND DON'T SEEM TO HAVE HAD ANY SUCCESS STORIES WITH THEIR GRAD STUDENTS ENTERING ACADEMIA OR EVEN INDUSTRY FOR THAT MATTER I KNOW THIS IS COMMON FOR THEORY BUT APPARENTLY ONE ADVISEE MOVED TO A TENT IN SOUTH AFRICA TAKING POSTDOCS AND SLOWLY LOSING THEIR MIND THIS WAS ONE OF HIS MORE PROMISING STUDENTS TO TRY ACADEMIA THERE ARE SOME PHENOMENOLOGIST HERE THAT SEEM DECENT AND AT LEAST GOOD TO HAVE AS ADVISERS BUT QUANTUM GRAVITY QUITE LITERALLY KEEPS ME UP AT NIGHT

HEY I AM AN UNDERGRAD WHO HAS TAKEN 2 COURSES IN QUANTUM MECHANICS OVER THE PAST YEAR BUT MY FUNDAMENTALS IN THE SUBJECT ARE WEAK I WOULD LIKE TO STUDY THEM AGAIN BUT RETAKING THE COURSE IS NOT AN OPTION SINCE THE TIMINGS OF THE COURSES CLASH WITH MY CURRENT COMPULSORY COURSES IS IT VIABLE TO STUDY SOME TEXTBOOK AND STICK WITH IT TO THE SAME EFFECT WHAT BOOK WOULD YOU RECOMMEND IF NOT WHAT OTHER WAYS CAN I GET BETTER
PLEASE PEOPLE HELP ME

SO I'M TORN BETWEEN DOING MATHS AND PHYSICS THERE'S A PROGRAM CALLED PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS WHICH FROM WHAT I SAW INCLUDES BOTH IMPORTANT CLASSES FROM BOTH DOMAINS THE MAIN ROOTS OF BOTH I WOULD BE DOING REAL ANALYSIS CLASSICAL MECHANICS ET ALL THE PROGRAM IS YEARS

DID ANYONE DO SOMETHING OF THIS SORT IN WHAT DID YOU SPECIALIZE AFTERWARDS WHAT JOB PROSPECTS CAN YOU SERIOUSLY EXPECT FROM THIS
I WILL SOON FINALLY GRADUATE WITH MY BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN APPLIED PHYSICS I'M CURRENTLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT DIRECTION TO GIVE TO MY MASTER'S I'M TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH QUANTUM COMPUTING RIGHT NOW BUT THE FIELD IS IN SUCH AN EARLY STAGE THAT IT SEEMS I WILL LIKELY HAVE TO DO A PHD IN ORDER TO MAKE A CAREER OUT OF IT AND I REALLY DON'T THINK I'M CUT OUT FOR A PHD SO I WAS THINKING I COULD ALSO GO INTO THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY BUT I'M NOT SURE HOW DOABLE THAT IS WITH MY DEGREE I COULD SWITCH TO EE MSC BUT THAT WILL DELAY ME FOR ANOTHER YEAR GRADUATING THIS SEMESTER BRIDGING TRACK IS ONLY GIVEN IN FALL SEMESTER ANY THOUGHTS

HAVE YOU STUDIED QUANTUM FIELD THEORY AT THE GRADUATE LEVEL IF NOT THAT SHOULD BE YOUR FIRST STEP
THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO LORENTZ VIOLATION MIGHT GIVE YOU SOMETHING ELSE TO GOOGLE A BUNCH OF NEUTRINO EXPERIMENTS HAVE LIMITS I BELIEVE
CPT VIOLATION IS GENERALLY STUDIED IN COLLIDER OR NEUTRINO EXPERIMENTS YOU PROBABLY NEED ACCESS TO ONE OF THOSE TO DO A CPT EXPERIMENT

IF YOU WANT TO STUDY IT YOU NEED TO LEARN SOME AFT AND LOTS OF EXPERIMENTAL PARTICLE PHYSICS
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY ITALIAN ACTUAL ITALIAN CITIZENS PEOPLE AT ITALIAN UNIVERSITIES OR ITALIAN PEOPLE AT FOREIGN UNIVERSITIES ITALY SURE HAD ITS SHARE OF FAMOUS PHYSICISTS BUT THAT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE CURRENT QUALITY OF THEIR INSTITUTIONS IN FACT PEOPLE AT MY UNIVERSITY ARE STILL MAKING FUN OF ITALY FOR THEIR FASTER THAN LIGHT NEUTRINOS ALSO IF YOU THROW ENOUGH MONEY AT IT ANYTHING CAN SOMEHOW COMPETE WITH MIT BUT IF YOU CAN'T CONVINCE POLITICS TO FUND IT YOU'RE NEVER GONNA MAKE IT INTO THE HIGHER RANKINGS
I MEAN THERE ARE REALLY NO WORLD CLASS ITALIAN UNIVERSITIES BUT THERE IS CERTAINLY A VERY LONG LIST OF ITALIAN PHYSICISTS WHO HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL SO ITALIAN PHYSICS IN ITALY IS NOT EXACTLY THRIVING
GREAT EDUCATION BUT HORRIBLY UNDERFUNDED LABORATORIES ITALIAN EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICISTS ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL OUTSIDE ITALY
I THINK THAT WITH MORE MONEY IT COULD COMPETE WITH MIT

ISN'T THAT OBVIOUS UNLESS YOU HAVE SOME UNDERLYING RACIAL IDEAS THAT MAKE YOU THINK THIS ISN'T OBVIOUS AND THAT SOMEHOW ISN'T A GIVEN BECAUSE IT'S ITALY AND NOT SAY AMERICA OR ANOTHER COUNTRY

VERY QUESTIONABLE POST
IF YOU KNOW AT WHAT HEIGHT THE CENTRE OF MASS OF THE JEEP IS FOUND AND THE WIDTH OF THE CAR MEASURED BETWEEN THE OUTER SIDES OF THE WHEELS IT CAN BE CALCULATED HOW MUCH ENERGY IS REQUIRED TO TOPPLE THE CAR ESSENTIALLY YOU NEED TO FIND THE ANGLE AT WHICH THE CAR NEEDS TO BE HELD TO HAVE IT FALL ON ITS SIDE HAVE TO DRAW THE SITUATION TO DERIVE THIS EXACTLY
THE KINETIC ENERGY IN SIDEWAYS DIRECTION NEEDS TO BE AT LEAST THIS AMOUNT KINETIC ENERGY EQUATES TO SPEED WITH E MV 2 AND THIS SPEED IS THE COMPONENT IN SIDEWAYS DIRECTION TO KNOW THE INCIDENT SPEED YOU NEED TO DIVIDE THE SIDEWAYS SPEED COMPONENT BY THE SINE OF THE INCOMING ANGLE

YOU ALSO MENTIONED YOUR CAR PINNED DEGREES ON ITS SIDE BUT THIS IS LESS USEFUL AS THE FRICTION OF THE CAR ON THE ROAD SURFACE WOULD HAVE TO BE KNOWN THERE ARE PROBABLY NOT THAT MANY STUDIES ON THE FRICTION COEFFICIENT OF THE SIDE OF A JEEP AGAINST ASPHALT ALSO GIVEN THE POINT OF IMPACT IS QUITE CLOSE TO THE CENTRE OF THE CAR THE TORQUE CANNOT BE DETERMINED VERY PRECISELY
THE PROBLEM WITH DOING THIS IS THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU GAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION WE ARE MISSING SOME VERY CRITICAL DETAILS FIRST THE HYUNDAI COULD HAVE ACTED AS A WEDGE ALLOWING YOUR JEEP TO PUT SOME OF ITS OWN KINETIC ENERGY INTO FLIPPING ITSELF ALSO MOST OF THE ENERGY IN A CAR CRASH ACTUALLY GOES INTO DEFORMING THE CAR THE ENTIRE POINT OF CRUMPLE ZONES SO WE WOULD HAVE TO KNOW HOW MUCH WENT INTO CRUSHING THE FRONT OF THE HYUNDAI AND THE SIDE OF YOUR CAR PLUS ALL THE ENERGY LOST FROM THE USUAL PROCESSES LIKE SOUND HEAT ETC WE CAN DO SOME VERY ROUGH APPROXIMATIONS BUT THEY WILL BE ROUGH AND YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED HOW COMPARATIVELY LITTLE ENERGY IT TAKES TO FLIP A CAR

THE CENTER OF MASS OF YOUR CAR WOULD NEED TO BE LIFTED OVER THE TIRES IN ORDER TO FLIP LOOKING UP SOME ROUGH VALUES OF M WIDTH AND M HEIGHT AND ASSUMING THAT MASS WAS EVENLY DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE CAR BAD ASSUMPTION BUT IT'S BACK OF THE ENVELOPE MATH WE FIND THAT THE CENTER OF MASS IS ROUGHLY AT METERS HIGH THEN WE FIND THE HEIGHT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE AT OVER THE TIRES IF THE CAR WAS BALANCING ON TWO WHEELS USING SOME BASIC TRIG THIS GIVES US A HEIGHT OF METERS OFF THE GROUND TAKING THE MASS OF THE JEEP AND JUST CALCULATING THE DIFFERENCE IN POTENTIAL ENERGY MEAN THAT KJ OF ENERGY WERE PUT INTO YOUR CAR TO LIFT IT TO JUST BARELY AT THE TIPPING POINT THIS CORRESPONDS TO THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY CARRIED BY A HYUNDAI GOING MILES AN HOUR THIS WOULD BE THE ABSOLUTE MINIMUM FOR A CRASH THAT WAS EFFICIENT AT TRANSFERRING ENERGY AND AT A RIGHT ANGLE TO YOUR CAR ACCOUNTING FOR A DEGREE ANGLE ONLY BUMPS IT UP TO ABOUT MILES AN HOUR

UNLESS WE HAD A LOT MORE DETAIL THIS SOUNDS LIKE WE WOULD NEED SOMEONE WHO SPECIALIZED IN ACCIDENT RECONSTRUCTION AND CRASH ANALYSIS WHO MIGHT KNOW HOW MUCH ENERGY VARIOUS THINGS WOULD EAT UP IN A COLLISION
THAT SOUNDS LIKE STRAIGHT OUT OF A SCIENCE FICTION MANUAL
THE MODELING THEORY BASICALLY RIPS OFF THIS PRIOR WORK WHICH WASN'T CITED IN THEIR ARTICLE THIS IS COMPLETELY UNSURPRISING FROM THIS GROUP WHO LIKE TO PRETEND NOBODY ELSE IN THE FIELD EXISTS
THEY ARE AMAZING HE WILL PUT A LITTLE MORE EMPHASIS ON THE MATH AND GIVE YOU A MORE THEORETICAL INTUITION WHEREAS LEWIN WILL DO DEMONSTRATIONS AND GIVE A GOOD PHYSICAL INTUITION FOLLOW BOTH IF YOU CAN I FOUND SHANKAR TO BE EXCEPTIONALLY CLEAR AND HE IS FUNNY AS HELL
I'VE NEVER GONE THROUGH HIS ONLINE LECTURES AS YOU'RE INTENDING TO BUT QUANTUM MECHANICS TEXTBOOK IS GREAT AS OTHERS HAVE NOTED IT'S MORE THEORETICAL IN BASE BUT IT'S GOOD

THEY'RE OLDER AND A TOUCH OUTDATED BUT LECTURES TEXTBOOKS AVAILABLE ONLINE TOO ARE EXCELLENT THERE'S A CLARITY IN HIS EXPLANATIONS THAT IS UNMATCHED
SHANKAR ALSO HAS A NICE MATH BOOK TO GO ALONG WITH HIS COURSE IT CAN BE FOUND ONLINE
I'M TAKING PHYSICS RIGHT NOW AND MY PROFESSOR REALLY LIKES DR SHANKAR HE TEACHES EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE LEARNING BUT AT A FASTER PACE AND THE WAY HE DESCRIBES CONCEPTS IS VERY CLEAR I HAVE TO GO BACK AND FORTH A LOT TO FULLY COMPREHEND EVERYTHING THOUGH ALSO HAVEN'T ATTEMPTED HIS PRACTICE PROBLEMS
I WATCHED THEM DURING MY FIRST AND SECOND YEAR AND THOUGHT THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT PRETTY EASY GOING YOU JUST SOAK UP A LOT OF USEFUL INSIGHT

THE THEORY IS WRITTEN AS A TENSOR EQUATION
IF YOU WANT MORE CONCEPT AND LESS MATH THE SUSSKIND LECTURES ARE GOOD

WATCH V HBM LIST LPPSIJDE NQORTP

IF YOU WANT MORE MATH HERE ARE SOME LECTURES BY ALEXANDER MALONEY

WATCH V GDFQXYKJYCM LIST LRBYZNU

WITH RECORDED LECTURES YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR OWN PACE SO YOU CAN SWITCH BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN MATH AND PHYSICS AS NEEDED
LINEAR ALGEBRA DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS A LITTLE VECTOR CALC WON'T HURT AND SOME DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY
DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY

EDIT I LIKE

BARRETT O'NEILL GEOMETRY WITH APPLICATIONS TO
RELATIVITY

BUT IT'S A PURE MATH BOOK IT'S PROBABLY A BIT OVERKILL IF YOU WANT TO
DO PHYSICAL EXAMPLES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BUT STILL A VERY GOOD BOOK IF
YOU WANT TO GET A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING AFTERWARDS

AND THE CHAPTER ABOUT MULTILINEAR ALGEBRA IS VERY GOOD TO AVOID THE
TYPICAL CONFUSIONS ABOUT TENSORS SEEING TENSORS AS MULTILINEAR MAPS
INSTEAD OF SOME THING WITH LOTS OF INDICES MAKES EVERYTHING MUCH
CLEARER

DON'T FORGET THE PHYSICS PREREQUISITE IS A GOOD FOUNDATION OF ANALYTICAL MECHANICS
IT'S AMAZING HOW ONE WORD DIFFERENCE CAN CHANGE HOW DIFFICULT SOMETHING IS FROM SR TO GRAMMAR

SR IS EASILY TAUGHT IN FIRST YEAR MAIN PHYSICS COURSE AT UNIVERSITY GR REQUIRES EITHER AN AMAZING 4TH YEAR MASTERS OR JUST A SET OF COURSES FOR PHD STUDENTS THIS IS FROM AN AUSTRALIAN PERSPECTIVE IMMOV

WOULD LOVE TO KNOW OTHER PEOPLE'S TRAJECTORY
A BRIEF ON TENSOR ANALYSIS BY J SIMMONDS IS WHAT I USED TO LEARN HOW TO USE EXPRESS TENSORS IT'S SUCCINCT AND EASILY UNDERSTANDABLE THE WHOLE BOOK IS ONLY ABOUT PAGES
I KNOW IT'S NOT THE SAME AS MASTERING THE THEORY OF GRAVITATION BUT I GOT A B IN GENERAL RELATIVITY AT MY UNIVERSITY LAST YEAR AND MY ONLY MATH REQUIREMENTS WERE DIFF EQ AND LINEAR ALGEBRA

THE LATER STUFF USED A BIT OF TOPOLOGY BUT NOT ENOUGH TO NEED TO KNOW AND OUR PROFESSOR DID A GREAT JOB WITH FILLING US IN WITH WHAT WE NEEDED TO KNOW
THERE IS A FREE COURSE ON GR AT COURSER WHICH STARTED JUST LAST WEEK CHECK OUT THE FIRST FEW VIDEOS TO SEE IF IT IS SOMETHING YOU CAN HANDLE
IT'S ALSO A STEPPING STONE TO LEARNING ABOUT STRING THEORY
IT WAS SO COOL
DUDE GREAT FUCKING VIDEO LOVED IT
DID YOU LAUNCH THE REEL AND HOLD THE LOOSE END OR TIE THE LOOSE END TO THE PROJECTILE AND HAVE THE REEL ON A SPINDLE
THIS IS THE KIND OF DEMONSTRATION THAT GETS BORED HIGHSCHOOL STUDENTS INTERESTED IN PHYSICS FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES

ALSO KUDOS FOR SAYING THAT PER SECOND SQUARED IS A TERRIBLE WAY TO PUT THE CONCEPT IT'S INTIMIDATING TO PUT IT THAT WAY AND YOU EXPLAINED THE CORE PRINCIPLE QUITE WELL
COMPRESSED AIR IN PVC PIPE IS NO BUENO THAT WHITE SCD PIPE IS ONLY GOOD FOR PSI WHEN NEW AND AT NORMAL TEMPS IF IT GETS COLD AND OLD IT GOES BOOM AND SENDS PLASTIC SHARDS AT HIGH SPEED INTO SQUISHY OBJECTS

STEEL PIPE ISN'T MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO WORK WITH THAN PLASTIC PIPE AND IT WON'T BLOW APART AT PSI

OTHER THAN THAT VERY COOL VIDEO
I LIKED STEPS AND 2 WHERE WE ATTACHED SOME VCR TAPE TO A PROJECTILE SHOT IT AND RECORDED THE MOTION BUT I WAS DISAPPOINTED WE DIDN'T GET STEPS AND WHERE WE USE THE VIDEO TO COMPUTE THE INITIAL VELOCITY OF THE PROJECTILE CALCULATE THE EXPECTED PARABOLIC TRAJECTORY AND THEN COMPARE OUR TRAJECTORY TO THE THEORETICAL MODEL
DELETED
COOL VIDEO I STARTED TO THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH THE COUPLING OF THE TAPE WILL AFFECT THE SHAPE ONE COULD SEE THAT THE PARABOLA SHAPE CHANGED OVER TIME SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT EXAM PROBLEM FOR THEORETICAL PHYSICS
A LITTLE FUN EXPERIMENT WITH A COUPLED SYSTEM
MY FIRST RECOMMENDATION WOULD PROBABLY BE THAT EXACT BOOK I THINK IT'S PRETTY GOOD AND BASIC COMPARED TO MANY MATH BOOKS ON THE SUBJECT THE FIRST HALF OF THESE LECTURE NOTES ARE ALSO A GOOD INTRODUCTION TO THIS STUFF HE GOES THROUGH THE RELEVANT CONCEPTS PRETTY QUICKLY AND THEN EXPLAINS THE CLASSIFICATION OF SIMPLE LIE ALGEBRAS THESE LECTURES ARE ALSO EXCELLENT BUT HE PERHAPS GOES A TAD TOO QUICK


IF YOU WANT TO SEE MORE THE CONNECTION TO PARTICLE PHYSICS I GUESS YOU NEED A PARTICLE PHYSICS AND OR AFT BOOK AS WELL I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATION FOR A BOOK ABOUT PARTICLE PHYSICS SOME PEOPLE LIKE GRIFFITHS BUT I HAVEN'T REALLY USED IT AND I DIDN'T LIKE THE BOOKS WE USED IN THE COURSE I TOOK FOR AFT AND PERSONALLY I DON'T THINK PARTICLE PHYSICS MAKES MUCH SENSE UNLESS YOU KNOW THE BASICS OF AFT PESKIN AND SCHROEDER IS THE STANDARD BOOK AND IT'S PRETTY GOOD SREDNICKI IS A BIT MORE MODERN AND THERE IS A FREE PDF FLOATING AROUND SOMEWHERE CIRC
PHYSICS FROM SYMMETRY BY SCHWICTENBERG WAS WRITTEN FOR YOU STARTS OFF WITH TEACHING YOU BASICS ABOUT GROUPS AND THEN BRINGS IN PHYSICS HIGHLY RECOMMEND GIVEN THAT YOU HAVE A BACHELOR IN PHYSICS AND SOME OTHER BOOKS IN THIS FIELD ARE TERRIBLE TO START WITH
THERE ARE MANY GOOD TEXTBOOKS ON THIS MY TWO FAVORITES ARE

STERNBERG GROUP THEORY AND PHYSICS CUP

TUNG GROUP THEORY IN PHYSICS WORLD SCIENTIFIC

THE ABSOLUTE CLASSIC IS GROUP THEORY AND QUANTUM MECHANICS DOVER WHICH NOW BEING ON DOVER IS REALLY CHEAP BUT THE TWO ABOVE ARE MUCH CLEARER AT LEAST FOR PEDESTRIANS LIKE ME
I DON'T LIKE H BOOK FOR MANY REASONS BUT IT SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE READABLE AND UNDERSTANDABLE AT LEAST THE FIRST FEW CHAPTERS ARE FAIRLY WELL WRITTEN
I RECOMMEND BOOK ON GROUP THEORY IT'S NOT FOCUSED ON PARTICLE PHYSICS IN PARTICULAR BUT I FOUND IT VERY COMPREHENSIBLE AND WELL-WRITTEN
HE IS TRYING TO GET THE CLASS TO REMEMBER THE INFORMATION WITH THE MIND PALACE TECHNIQUE
MIND PALACE
THESE ARE SO PERFECT I DON'T HATE DOGS BUT MY UNDERGRAD EXPERIENCE FEELS LACKING NOW
I STARTED PHYSICS THE YEAR THAT THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT DIRECTED THAT PHYSICS BE MADE MORE RELEVANT FOR GIRLS THAT YEAR I DID CALCULATIONS ON SHOPPING TROLLIES CRASHING INTO CARS IN CAR PARKS THE BEHAVIOUR OF BALLS ON A NETBALL COURT THROWING A WEDDING RING OFF A CLIFF AND WHETHER OR NOT THE WEDDING RING WOULD HIT THE GROUND AT THE SAME TIME AS THE EX HUSBAND
LIKE MY TEACHER EXCEPT HE FIRES STUDENTS OUT OF CANNONS AND OFF CLIFFS

DON'T WORRY IT'S NEVER LIKE A THREAT HE'S JUST PERSONABLE
MY OLD PHYSICS TEACHER HATES HIS MOTHER IN LAW SO HE DID THE SAME THING WITH HIS MOTHER IN LAW THERE WAS AN IMPACT EXAMPLE WHERE HE SHOT HER WITH A GUN
I USED TO USE GARY LARSON COWS FOR MY PRESENTATION

GUESS I'M OLD
MY KIND OF GUY
GREAT SENSE OF HUMOUR COOL TEACHER
IN A SIMILAR FASHION MY PHYSICS I II TEXTBOOK HAD A STRANGE OBSESSION WITH PENGUINS
TUNED IN EXPECTING AN EXPLANATION LEFT WITH A DEFINITION OF MINIMAL PERFECT PAIRING A REFERENCE TO A PAPER ON TOPOLOGICAL QUANTUM MEMORY AND SOME ANECDOTES
CONWAY SLOAN SPHERE PACKING LATTICES AND GROUPS
BASED ON A CONVERSATION WITH PROF ANDREW LANDAHL BUT IT'S DR JAMES WOOTTON DRONING ON
ANY LINKS TO SOMETHING I CAN READ RATHER THAN WHAT I WOULD CALL A RAMBLING VIDEO
IF I WAS FALLING WITHIN OUR ATMOSPHERE STANDING ON A PLATFORM AND JUMPED WOULD I SEPARATE FROM IT UNDER THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS

WITH AIR RESISTANCE
2 IGNORING AIR RESISTANCE
AT TERMINAL VELOCITY

MY FRIENDS AND I COMMONLY DEBATE THIS TO NO END THANKS

IS SOUND JUST A TRAVELLING PRESSURE GRADIENT
WILL QUANTUM NETWORK DECREASE THE TIME IT TAKES TO TALK BETWEEN PLANETS

SAY BETWEEN EARTH AND MARS

IF NOT WHAT IS A METHOD THAT COULD THEORETICALLY DECREASE THE TIME TO ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY
I'VE NOTICED A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WITHOUT PHYSICS KNOWLEDGE WHO SEEM TO THINK THAT ONE CAN MAKE A PERPETUAL MOTION DEVICE USING MAGNETS AND NEWTONIAN PHYSICS IT SEEMS INTUITIVE THAT THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE DUE TO CONSERVATION OF ENERGY BUT IS THERE A FORMAL PROOF THAT I CAN POINT TO WHEN SOMEONE BRINGS IT UP
I HAVE A CONSTANT ACCELERATION FIELD VALUE G

I PUT A MASS M IN THAT ACCELERATION FIELD IT ACCELERATES WITH G OBVIOUSLY

REVERSE TIME I PUT A MASS M IN THAT ACCELERATION FIELD AND IT HOVERS FROM MY FIELD OF VIEW HOW MUCH ENERGY DOES IT USE

OF COURSE YOU CAN ONLY SAY SOMETHING ABOUT ENERGY IF I SPECIFY THE TIME T IT HOVERS SO LET'S REPHRASE

I PUT A MASS M IN THAT ACCELERATION FIELD AND IT HOVERS HOW MUCH POWER IS REQUIRED TO DO SO

MY IDEA IS THAT THIS POWER MUST BE CONSTANT DEPENDING ON M AND G OF COURSE BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE IT SHOULD TAKE DOUBLE THE ENERGY FOR THE MASS TO HOVER FOR SECONDS THAN IT TAKES FOR THE MASS TO HOVER FOR SECONDS

THAT FIELD IS JUST THERE NO OTHER MASS TO CAUSE IT THAT WOULD BE TOO EASY AS YOU COULD JUST BUT A BLOCK BETWEEN THE TWO MASSES OF COURSE THIS IS STRICTLY THEORETICAL BUT IT FEELS LIKE IT MUST BE SOLVABLE TO ME HOWEVER I JUST CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO SOLVE IT
IS THERE MUCH KNOWN ABOUT A LOWER LIMIT ON BLACK HOLE MASS RADIUS OR SOME OTHER PARAMETER
IS IT TRUE WE STILL DON'T HAVE A COMPUTER SIMULATION OF A SUPERNOVA THAT EXPLAINS WHY THE STAR EXPLODES I WAS WATCHING AN OLDER DOCUMENTARY AND IT SAID OUR MODELS SHOW THE STARS SHOULD JUST COLLAPSE WE KNOW FROM OBSERVATION THAT THEY DO IN FACT GO NOVA BUT WHAT DO WE CURRENTLY KNOW ABOUT THE MECHANISM OF HOW THAT HAPPENS
WHY IS THE SURFACE OF MY COFFEE BEHAVING DISCONTINUISHLY
I TOOK THE LID OFF MY COFFEE TO LET IT COOL ON THE SURFACE I SAW A SHIMMERING PATTERN OF EDDIES AND SWIRLS WHICH I TOOK TO BE MOLTEN MICROGLOBULES OF CREAM THAT HAD GATHERED ON THE SURFACE
WHAT WAS STRANGE IS THAT THE MOVEMENT OF THE PATTERNS TOOK THE FORM OF SUDDEN RAPID EVENTS AT IRREGULAR INTERVALS LIKE A LINE WOULD QUICKLY SWEEP ALONG A CENTIMETER AND THEN ABRUPTLY STOP OR A CIRCLE WOULD SUDDENLY EXPLODE OUTWARD AND THEN JUST AS SUDDENLY HALT
ARE THERE CONDITIONS WHERE A FLUID WOULD BEHAVE THIS WAY OR ARE THERE MICROSCOPIC PARTICLES LANDING IN MY COFFEE AND PRECIPITATING THESE EVENTS
HOW DO REFLECTIONS WORK

COULD SOMEONE EXPLAIN IN TERMS OF SURFACE ROUGHNESS VIEWING ANGLE ANISOTROPIC AND FRESNEL REFLECTIONS REFLECTIONS ON SURFACES
I'VE BEEN THROUGH SOME MILITARY TRAINING AND I WAS TAUGHT THAT BULLETS RISE THEN FALL I TOLD THIS TO MY PHYSICS TEACHER AND HE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS TRUE AND THERE WAS NO BASIS FOR THIS LOOKED UP THE TRAJECTORY AND IT WAS INDEED A PARABOLA MY QUESTION IS WHY THE BARREL IT'S SELF IS STRAIGHT IS THERE A GOOD PHYSIC ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION SO I CAN SOUND SMART NEXT CLASS
HOW VIABLE IS AN BS ENGINEERING PHYSICS DEGREE STRAIGHT OUT OF COLLEGE I LOVE PHYSICS BUT DONT WANT TO DO RESEARCH OR ANY I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING INVOLVING PHYSICS BUT HAVE SOME PRACTICALITY ANYONE OUT THERE WITH THIS DEGREE WORKING WITHIN THE FIELD
DELETED
IF I WAS DROPPING A PENNY FROM THE STRATOSPHERE WHAT SIZE DOES A CUP NEED TO BE FOR THE PROBABILITY OF THE PENNY LANDING IN THE CUP TO BE EQUAL TO THE PROBABILITY OF A GAMMA RAY BURST HITTING EARTH ASSUME EVERYWHERE IS AT SEA LEVEL AND THE PENNY IS DROPPED FROM A RANDOM LOCATION ALSO NO WIND AND NO EARTH ROTATION YOU COULD CONSIDER THE PENNY HITTING THE RIM AND FALLING OUT IF YOU WANT
QUANTUM MECHANICS ASSUMES THAT ELECTRONS BEHAVE LIKE QUANTUM OBJECTS END OF STORY IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS AND ONLY IN THOSE LUCKY SITUATIONS CAN YOU SAY THAT THOSE QUANTUM OBJECTS LOOK KIND OF LIKE CLASSICAL WAVES OR PARTICLES BUT THAT'S AN INTERPRETATION THAT YOU'RE ADDING ON
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THE QUANTUM MODEL
AFT STATES ALL PARTICLES ARE EXCITATIONS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE FIELDS TO PUT IT SIMPLY WE SEE AN ELECTRON AS A DISTURBANCE IN THE ELECTRON FIELD DUALITY COMES INTO PLAY WITH HOW ELECTRONS MOVE THROUGH THE FIELD ELECTRONS DO NOT HAVE A KNOWN LOCATION UNTIL IT IS OBSERVED MEANING INTERACTING WITH ANOTHER PARTICLE THE FAMED DOUBLE SLIT EXPERIENENTS PHYSICALLY SHOWS A WAVE INTERFERENCE PATTERN EVEN WITH A SINGLE ELECTRON IT INTERFERES WITH ITSELF SO A PROBABILITY WAVE IS USED TO DESCRIBE THIS PHENOMENON BUT IT'S JUST A WAY TO SAY WE CANNOT KNOW FOR CERTAIN WHERE THE ELECTION IS IN THE FIELD UNTIL A PHOTON OR SOMETHING INTERACTS WITH IT THEN ITS LOCATION IS CERTAIN ON THE FLIP SIDE IT ALSO HAS QUALITIES OF PARTICLES ELECTRON SCATTERING MICROSCOPES DEPENDS ON ELECTRONS INTERACTING LIKE A PARTICLE HOPE THIS HELPS SO YOU CAN SIMPLY SAY IT HAS THE QUALITIES OF BOTH HENCE WAVE PARTICLE DUALITY

SHE WAS A GREAT SPEAKER AND VERY CHEERFUL PERSON IT'S VERY SAD SHE DIED SO YOUNG
NO
WAY TO YOUNG RIP
FUCK MAN I WORKED AT JILA A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO AND SHE ALWAYS SEEMED LIKE A REALLY NICE PERSON NEVER EVEN KNEW SHE WAS SICK
VERY SAD SHE WAS A FANTASTIC PHYSICIST AND FROM EVERYTHING I'VE HEARD A WONDERFUL HUMAN BEING
I THOUGHT I SAW HER NAME ON A LIST OF NOBEL PRIZE PREDICTIONS FOR THIS YEAR I KNOW THEY DON'T GIVE IT POSTHUMOUSLY THOUGH
WAS HER EARLY DEATH SOMEHOW RELATED TO HER WORK
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS PICTURE IS TRYING TO SAY
NO I'M AFRAID THE METAPHOR DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE

MASS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE MOVED THROUGH ALSO SPACE DISTANCE OVER TIME IS CALLED VELOCITY IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR SPEED TO MOVE THROUGH ANYTHING
IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A BODY OF MASS MOVE THROUGH SPACE SPACE ACTS LIKE A STRETCHY FABRIC MORPHING GRAVITY AROUND IT AS IT MOVES THROUGH SPACE

FROM WHAT I CAN GATHER THIS IS IMAGINING 2 DIMENSIONAL MASS IN DIMENSIONAL SPACE
YOUR OWN CONSCIOUSNESS JUST AFFECTED BOTH YOUR REALITY AND MINE BECAUSE YOU POSTED THIS QUESTION
THAT'S NOT REALLY A PHYSICS QUESTION PHYSICS DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT OUR CONSCIOUSNESS MAYBE A PHILOSOPHY QUESTION THE IDEA SOUNDS KIND OF ABSURD TO ME BUT I'M NOT WELL-VERSED IN PHILOSOPHY
HERE'S WHY THIS QUESTION IS MEANINGLESS

DEFINE CONSCIOUSNESS IN AN ABSOLUTE FRAMEWORK YOU CAN'T BECAUSE IT'S A SUBJECTIVE PHENOMENON BY DEFINITION

ALSO YOU ARE BEGGING THE QUESTION BY IMPLYING CONSCIOUSNESS AND REALITY COULD BE TWO DISTINCT PHENOMENON OBVIOUSLY THIS IS FALSE BECAUSE ANY DEFINITION OF CONSCIOUSNESS IS COMPRISED OF AND IMPACTED BY REALITY AT ALL TIMES WHETHER STIMULUS IS SYMBOLIC OR NOT
IN ONE SENSE YES QUANTUM MECHANICS DOES NOT PREDICT TELEKINESIS THIS LINE OF THOUGHT USUALLY STEMS FROM A MISUNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE WORD OBSERVATION MEANS IN QUANTUM MECHANICS

IN ANOTHER SENSE NUMBER RANDOM FIRING OF NEURONS GIVES US A DREAM WHICH BECOMES A PLAN THE BRAIN MOVES THE HAND TO MOVE A STONE THAT MIGHT REMAIN IN PLACE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS
BUDDHIST GUY WHO IS STUDYING PHYSICS IN UNI AT THE AGE OF
YOUR QUESTION IS EXACTLY WHAT I AM PLANNING TO PROVE IN MAYBE YEARS

THE POINT IS I HAD THOUSANDS OF PROOF EXPERIENCES AND PEOPLE GIVING LIFE EXPERIENCE THAT WHAT YOU ARE ASKING IS POSITIVE AND TRUE

PEOPLE HEALING FROM CANCER THINGS HAPPENING ONLY BECAUSE SOMEONE REALLY WANTED PERSONALLY IT I LIVE IT ON A DAILY BASIS

AND NO NOT SELF BELIEF BULLSHIT
REALITY ESPECIALLY ONE'S LIFE IT IS CARVED MAINLY BY THE INVISIBLE ATTITUDE AND PARTLY BY IT ACTIONS

THE SAME ACTION IN A SIMILAR SITUATION CAN HAVE DIFFERENT RESULTS CHAOS AND QUANTUM PHYSICS AGREE WITH THAT

UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE TO PROVE IT YET

SO FAR I CAN ONLY THEORIZE STUPIDLY WITHOUT ENOUGH GROUND THAT QUANTA AND QUARKS THE SMALLEST PART OF OUR REALITY MIGHT BE AFFECTED BY THE ELECTRIC FIELD IN THE HUMAN BRAIN AND THIS HAPPENS EVEN IN LONG TERM

AGAIN JUST WILD THEORIES


AS SOMEONE FAIRLY WELL VERSED IN PHILOSOPHY AND PHYSICS NUMBER THIS COMES A DEEP MISUNDERSTANDING OF QUANTUM MECHANICS MANY PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT QM MEANS THE UNIVERSE CANNOT BE DETERMINISTIC BUT THEN ASSUME THAT LEAVES ONLY THE OPTION OF FREE WILL EXISTING WHICH MEANS THAT CONSCIOUSNESS SHAPES REALITY THE TRUTH HOWEVER IS THAT THE UNIVERSE IS INDETERMINISTIC AND DOESN'T CARE ONE BIT ABOUT YOU HELL IT DOESN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE YOU AS BEING A DISCRETE THING YOU'RE JUST A BUNCH OF PARTICLES THROWN TOGETHER TO IT
IF PHYSICS HAS LEARNED ANYTHING IN THE PAST HUNDRED YEARS IT'S THAT SOMETIMES THINGS AREN'T LIKE YOU THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE SO FAR WE'VE FOUND ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THAT SUGGESTS THIS COULD BE POSSIBLE AND IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE WITHIN OUR CURRENT THEORIES BUT SAYING THAT THE IDEA IS ABSURD IN ITSELF IS MEANINGLESS A LOT OF PEOPLE CONSIDERED QUANTUM MECHANICS TO BE ABSURD AND YET HERE WE ARE
THERE IS NO KNOWN MECHANISM IN OUR PHYSICAL UNIVERSE THAT WOULD TURN IT INTO THE MATRIX
IDEAS ARE USELESS IF YOU CAN'T PROVE ANYTHING THE SCIENTIFIC MODEL IS BASED ON EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE WHAT YOU HAVE SHARED IS UNFALSIFIABLE AND THEREFORE NOT SCIENCE
YOU MAY BE INTERESTED IN THIS
I'LL BE THE FIRST TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT'S LIKELY VERY SILLY AND I APOLOGIZE FOR WASTING YOUR TIME THAT BEING SAID IT WOULD BE INTERESTING IF THERE WAS A LINK BETWEEN MATTER ANTIMATTER AND HOW WE EXPERIENCE ARROW
AWESOME IDEA DOG MAY NOT WORK BUT IT'S GREAT TO JUST PUT IT OUT THERE NEVER STOP
I DON'T ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS SUCH A TERRIBLE IDEA ESPECIALLY IF YOU EXTEND YOUR MIND BEYOND THE REACHES OF WHAT THE BOOKS WILL TEACH YOU THERE IS TRIED AND TESTED KNOWLEDGE OF SCIENCE AND THE CAPABILITIES OF THE MIND FAR BEYOND WHAT THE COMMON PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO KNOW AND IF YOU CONSIDER THESE THINGS TO BE TRUE THEN YOU'RE CRAZY NATURALLY RIGHT SARCASM OF COURSE BUT IT IS TRUE IN TERMS OF HOW OTHERS PERCEIVE YOU WHEN YOU BELIEVE IN THINGS BEYOND THE NORM SO IF BY SOME CHANCE YOU ARE VERY RIGHT THOSE THAT KNOW YOU ARE MAY TRY TO PROVE YOU VERY WRONG
IN THE CASE OF SPECIAL RELATIVITY I THINK WIKIPEDIA HAS A MARVELOUS SECTION IN THE ARTICLE HISTORY OF SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND THE ARTICLE ABOUT CRITICISM OF THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY BOTH SPECIAL AND GENERAL IS ALSO VERY RECOMMENDABLE NOTE THAT CRITICISM AGAINST EINSTEIN HIMSELF BECAUSE HE WAS A JEW WAS SO STRONG IN PARTS OF THE GERMAN PHYSICS COMMUNITY THAT AFTER THE NAZIS CAME INTO POWER THE SO CALLED DEUTSCHE PHYSIK PHYSICS WAS IMPOSED TO CLEANSE ACADEMIA OF HIS JEWISH THEORY
HERE IS A VERY INTERESTING ARTICLE ABOUT A FAMOUS DEBATE BETWEEN THE EMINENT PHILOSOPHER HENRI BERGSON AND ALBERT EINSTEIN POINTS APPARENTLY HAD AN INFLUENCE ON THE NOBEL COMMITTEE SUCH THAT IT AWARDED EINSTEIN THE PRIZE FOR HIS DISCOVERY OF THE PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT RATHER THAN FOR RELATIVITY

ISSUE BOUNDARIES
I'M INTERESTED IN HOW THEY WILL MAKE ORBITAL ADJUSTMENTS WITH THE FREE FLOATING CUBES ON BOARD DO THE CUBES GET PERIODICALLY LOCKED DOWN
U ALREADY POINTED OUT THAT THE OPPOSITE OF A BLACK HOLE IS A WHITE HOLE BUT A WHITE HOLE REQUIRES NEGATIVE MASSACHUSETTS WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IS A MASSLESS PARTICLE MASSLESS PARTICLES ARE NOT QUITE AS EXOTIC AS BLACK HOLES AND WE COME INTO CONTACT WITH THEM ALL THE TIME ONE EXAMPLE OF A MASSLESS PARTICLE IS THE PHOTON WHICH IS THE PARTICLE THAT CARRIES THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE AND ALSO THE PARTICLE THAT CARRIES LIGHT BECAUSE LIGHT IS A SPECIAL CASE OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE MASSLESS PARTICLES HAVE THE PECULIAR PROPERTY THAT THEY ALWAYS MOVE AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT IN ANY REFERENCE FRAME THEY PHYSICALLY CANNOT STAND STILL EVER YOU CANNOT EVEN TRY TO THINK OF A REFERENCE FRAME IN WHICH THEY STAND STILL BECAUSE THE NORMAL LAWS OF MOVEMENT AND CAUSALITY BREAK DOWN IF YOU TRY TO DO THAT
THERE'S NO EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER TO PROVE THAT BLACK HOLES ACTUALLY TEAR A HOLE THROUGH SPACE-TIME THAT IDEA WAS MERELY A HYPOTHESIS OUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF BLACK HOLES DOESN'T DISPROVE THAT HYPOTHESIS BUT IT DOES POINT TOWARDS AN OTHER DIRECTION AS WE SEE IT BLACK HOLES DON'T RIP SPACE-TIME THEY JUST CAUSE AN IMMENSE DISTURBANCE IN IT WHERE THE HUGE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE CAUSES TIME TO SLOW DOWN THE OBJECTS STUCK IN IT DON'T SIMPLY DISAPPEAR AND APPEAR ELSEWHERE AS IF THE BLACK HOLE WAS AN ENTRANCE TO A WORMHOLE THE INFORMATION ISN'T LOST IT'S MERELY STUCK INSIDE THE BLACK HOLE UNTIL IT GETS DISSIPATED AS HAWKING RADIATION

EDIT ADDITIONALLY IT'S NOT VERY ACCURATE TO TALK ABOUT NEGATIVE WEIGHT YOU SHOULD INSTEAD SAY NEGATIVE MASS BECAUSE WEIGHT REFERS TO THE RESULTANT FORCE IN A BODY CAUSED BY GRAVITY SEE THIS FOR A BETTER CLARIFICATION
IT'S THEORIZED TO BE A WHITE HOLE WHICH IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY SHOOTS OUT MATTER INSTEAD OF SUCKING IT IN ALSO IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY THERE'S THEORIES THAT STATE OUR UNIVERSE WAS FORMED FROM A WHITE HOLE THOUGH I HAVE ONLY EVER SEEN ONE ARTICLE ABOUT IT

HUH VERY INTERESTING I NEVER WOULD HAVE GUESSED THAT PURE WATER ICE COULD PRODUCE SUCH STRONG EMISSION UNDER UV EXCITATION A QUICKLY LITERATURE SEARCH SHOWS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A BIT OF WORK IN TRYING TO IDENTIFY THE ORIGIN OF THE LUMINESCENCE BUT THERE IS STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY THIS REVIEW PAPER SUGGESTS THAT THE BLUE EMISSION BAND AROUND THAT YOU SEE IS DUE TO A FORBIDDEN TRANSITION OF THE OH RADICAL THEY CLAIM THAT WHILE THIS STATE IS GENERALLY UNSTABLE IT MIGHT HANG AROUND LONGER WHEN THE HYDROXIDE RADICAL IS BOUND IN A MATRIX OF ICE
THE USUAL MECHANISM OF FORBIDDEN SPIN TRANSITION PHOSPHORESCENCE DOES NOT SEEM RELEVANT NOR DOES THE ENHANCED PHOSPHORESCENCE OF ORGANIC MATERIALS AT CRYOGENIC TEMPERATURES DUE TO SUPPRESSED COLLISIONAL LOSSES DEPOPULATING THE EXCITED STATE I AM AT A LOSS TO EXPLAIN THIS VERY SURPRISING PHENOMENON IN PURE WATER IS IT CHEMILUMINESCENCE VIA THE RADIOLYTIC CREATION OF SOME HIGH ENERGY FREE RADICALS
PURE WATER I'M ASSUMING THAT'S A LITTLE POETIC LICENSE IN THE TITLE
COULDN'T THIS JUST BE DUE TO FLUORINE IN THE TAP WATER AFTER ALL MOST PLACES MIX IN FLUORINE TO REDUCE TOOTH DECAY
DID YOU SERIOUSLY ACTUALLY OWN YOUR OWN JUST DISCOVER A NEW PROPERTY OF WATER WHAT
ICE LASER ANYONE
ALL THE POSTER WOULD HAVE TO DO IS MIX IN SOME AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS AND IT'S RELATIVELY TRIVIAL TO MAKE WATER FLUORESCE COULD USE A SPRAY BOTTLE TO SPREAD IT AROUND A BIT TO MAKE THE OTHER DOODADS GLOW TOO

PUBLICATION
BUT STILL HAVEN'T WE FIGURED WATER OUT YET JEEZ
WHAT ARE YOU COVERING
WHICH BOOK ARE YOU USING

THERE'S A HUGE VARIETY OF GOOD FREE ONLINE SOURCES ON CLASSICAL MECHANICS THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT I WOULD RECOMMEND THE LECTURES BY LEO SUSSKIND AS A GOOD WAY TO GET SOME OVERVIEW INTUITION YOU CAN ALSO CHECK OUT THE MIT OPENCOURSEWARE THEY HAVE BOTH LECTURE NOTES TO READ AND I THINK VIDEOS FOR SOME OF THEIR COURSES

GENERALLY THOUGH THE WAY TO LEARN PHYSICS OR MATH IS TO SOLVE PROBLEMS UNTIL YOU REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE DOING JUST READING OR WATCHING LECTURES ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH SO THAT WOULD BE MY SUGGESTION FOR HOW TO APPROACH THE BOOK SKIM THE CHAPTER NOTE THE KEY CONCEPTS AND FORMULAS NO NEED TO READ IN DETAIL IF THE BOOK IS VERBOSE AND THEN SOLVE SOME EXERCISES
WHAT UNIVERSITY ARE YOU ATTENDING
A LONG-LIVED SUSY PARTICLES WOULD NOT ANSWER NEARLY EVERY QUESTION ABOUT OUR COSMOS IT WOULD ANSWER THE QUESTION IS SUPERSYMMETRY REALIZED BUT THAT LEADS TO EVEN MORE FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DETAILS OF SUSY PARTICLES AS DISCUSSED IN THE ARTICLE ARE ALSO NOT DARK MATTER CANDIDATES BECAUSE THEY DECAY TOO FAST

ATLAS AND CMS HAVE SEARCHES FOR THOSE PARTICLES ALREADY THEY CAN DECAY IN THE DETECTOR OR AT LEAST THEY CAN BE DETECTED INDIRECTLY VIA THE MOMENTUM BALANCE IF AN INVISIBLE PARTICLE ESCAPES THE MOMENTUM IN THE DETECTOR IS UNBALANCED
INTERESTING READ

IN THE 2ND TO LAST PARAGRAPH IT'S SAID THAT INERT LONG-LIVED PARTICLES COULD BE RELATED TO DARK MATTER DOESN'T THIS REFER TO THE THEORETICAL HIDDEN VALLEY WORK THAT MATT STRASSLER AND KATHRYN ZUREK WROTE ABOUT BACK IN AND REFERRED TO IN RECENT ARTICLE HUNTING FOR DARK HIDDEN VALLEY
MUSIC TOO LOUD TO THINK CAN HELP NOTHING IN PARTICULAR WHATEVER YOU ARE INTO HOWEVER I WILD RECOMMEND SONGS ALBUMS YOU HAVE HEARD BEFORE AS NOVELTY ISN'T GREAT FOR SLEEPING
READ FICTION

IF YOU'RE AS OBSESSIVE WITH AS I CAN BE THEN YOUR BRAIN MOST LIKELY WON'T SWITCH OFF FOR BED WITH ANYTHING SHORT OF GETTING STONED WHICH ISN'T SOMETHING I WOULD RECOMMEND NOTHING WRONG WITH IT IF THAT'S YOUR THING BUT IF YOUR GOAL IS TO BE PRODUCTIVE THEN IT'S PROBABLY NOT

YOU CAN CHANGE THE CHANNEL THOUGH I FIND READING A FICTION BOOK GIVES ME SOMETHING SPECIFIC TO FOCUS ON THAT REQUIRES LITTLE MENTAL EFFORT FROM ME WHICH THEN ALLOWS ME TUNE OUT EVERYTHING ELSE AND RELAX ENOUGH TO FALL ASLEEP
SMOKE A BOOBIE DUDE
NO SPECIFIC ADVICE BUT I HAD THE SAME ALTHOUGH NOT IN GRAD SCHOOL YET THIS HAS BEEN A HUGE PROBLEM FOR ME DURING MY UNDERGRAD RESEARCH I WAS SO ABSORBED BY THINKING ABOUT IT AND WORKING ON IT AT EVENINGS I JUST AUTOMATICALLY ANSWERED TEXTS AND TOLD PEOPLE I COULDN'T COME OUT IN RETROSPECT I WASN'T HAPPY IN THAT PERIOD IT WAS A REALLY GREAT EXPERIENCE BUT IT TAKES MORE THAN THAT TO ENJOY LIFE IN GENERAL THIS COMBINED WITH ALL THE CLASSES MADE FOR A VERY TOUGH SEMESTER WHEN FINISHED IT WAS A BIT LIKE WAKING UP FROM A DREAM I AM CONTENT WITH THE WORK I HAVE DONE BUT I WOULDN'T DO IT AGAIN THE SAME WAY I'D BE DEFINITELY WILLING TO STRETCH IT OUT OVER ONE OR TWO MORE MONTHS AND HAVE A MORE BALANCED LIFE I KNOW I MAKE IT SOUND VERY DRAMATIC THE PHYSICS WASN'T THAT IMPRESSIVE JUST A LOT OF TEDIOUS CALCULATIONS

AS A LONG-TIME PRACTITIONER OF TM I AM COMPLETELY BIASED BUT TRANSCENDENTAL MEDITATION IS A GREAT WAY TO DEEPLY REST AND REJUVENATE THE MIND
WATCH V LIST ALI
WORK LIFE BALANCE EAT RIGHT EXERCISE MEDITATION NATURE WALKS MULTIFACETED PURPOSE TO YOUR LIFE FRIENDS FAMILY HOBBIES WORK AND HOME ENVIRONMENT
DOWNVOTED AGAIN IT'S FINE IN THE BEGINNING BUT AS THE SERIES GOES ON THE AUTHOR SLIPS IN MORE AND MORE MATERIAL ABOUT HIS OWN THEORY OF EVERYTHING EVERYTHING PAST THE START OF QUANTUM MECHANICS BELONGS IN A HOMEOPATHY SEMINAR NOT A PHYSICS TEXTBOOK
UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T REALLY RECOMMEND ANY DEFINITIVELY GOOD PHYSICS TEXTS FOR HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL I KNOW A DECENT BEGINNING BOOK I USED FOR PHYSICS IS PHYSICS FOR ENGINEERS AND SCIENTISTS BY OHANIAN MARKERT THIS A GOOD HS LEVEL INTRODUCTION TO MECHANICS AND E M BUT IS NOT GREAT

FOR SOME FURTHER ADVANCED TOPICS

CLASSICAL MECHANICS BY JOHN R TAYLOR
CLASSICAL DYNAMICS BY THORNTON AND MARION

WAVES AND OSCILLATIONS BY FITZPATRICK OR KING KING IF YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH COMPLEX FITZ IF U WANT A PURELY TRIGONOMETRIC VIEW OF WAVE INTERACTION

ELECTRODYNAMICS BY GRIFFITHS

AND INTRODUCTION TO QUANTUM MECHANICS BY GRIFFITHS
TO GET A GOOD IDEA OF WHY WE NEED QM WATCH SOME BEGINNING LECTURES OF FEYNMAN OR READ HIS LECTURE SERIES

A FIRST COURSE IN GENERAL RELATIVITY BY SCHUTZ IF YOU'RE FEELING ADVENTUROUS

THESE ARE ALL UNDERGRADUATE TEXTS BY THE WAY SO THEY ARE FRIENDLY IN THEIR TREATMENT OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS AND PROOFS WHICH REALLY MEANS THE PROOFS ARE HAND WAVEY AND THEOREMS ARE TYPICALLY TAKEN TO BE TRUE WITHOUT MUCH MOTIVATION
FOR ME IT NEVER FEELS THAT WAY TO STICK WITH YOUR PIECES FALLING IN PLACE ANALOGY I WOULD SAY PHYSICAL SCIENCES ARE LIKE AN INFINITE GAME OF TERRIS AS SOON AS YOU GAIN A FEELING OF UNDERSTANDING SOME ASPECT OF A SUBJECT YOU REALIZE THAT YOU NOW HAVE CREATED AS MANY QUESTIONS AS YOU'VE ANSWERED AND NEW INFORMATION IS ALWAYS INCOMING FOR YOU TO ASSIMILATE INTO YOUR WORLD-VIEW SOME MIGHT SAY THAT THERE IS AN ULTIMATE GOAL OF COMPLETE KNOWLEDGE BUT I REJECT THIS VIEW WE MUST ALWAYS BE SKEPTICAL OF WHAT WE KNOW
AFTER LEARNING THAT MOST PHYSICAL LAWS ARE DERIVED THROUGH SOME KIND OF MINIMIZATION PRINCIPLE WHETHER IT BE MINIMIZING THE ACTION OR MINIMIZING THE ENERGY
THE SEPARATE PHYSICS CLASSES MECHANICS THERMO E M QM ETC ALL FINALLY FIT TOGETHER FOR ME DURING AN UNDERGRADUATE CLASS ON THE PHYSICS OF STARS A CLASS WHICH INCIDENTALLY WASN'T ACTUALLY OFFERED BY THE PHYSICS DEPARTMENT
STATISTICAL MECHANICS SORT OF PULLED IT ALL TOGETHER FOR ME
I MINORED IN PHYSICS IT NEVER REALLY FELL INTO PLACE INTO SOME WAY THAT I COULD EVER BE PROFESSIONAL AT IT ALTHOUGH I DO HAVE ONE MEMORY FROM MY ADVANCED CLASS QUANTUM ENERGY WELLS ALL THAT STUFF WHERE I HAD GOTTEN THROUGH A POINT IN THE SEMESTER AND I WAS A BIT OVERWHELMED WELL WHAT I DID WAS FIND A BIG COMFY CHAIR AND LITERALLY MY ENTIRE PHYSICS BOOK FROM BEGINNING TO END ALL THE EXAMPLES ALL THE PARTS I WASN'T TOLD TO READ ETC IT TOOK ALL DAY I DIDN'T TRY TO WORK ON ANY PROBLEMS JUST READ AND JUST IN ONE CONTINUOUS SITTING CONNECTING EVERYTHING THINKING ABOUT EVERYTHING WITH NO PRESSURE TO DO ANY PARTICULAR ASSIGNMENT ALTHOUGH LOOKING AT THE PROBLEMS MANY LIGHTS WENT ON AND I WAS THEN EXCELLING I WISH I HAD DONE IT EARLIER IN OTHER CLASSES
ONCE YOU GET VERY COMFORTABLE WITH HAMILTONIAN AND THE LEGENDRE TRANSFORMATION PHYSICS STARTS FEELING MORE COHESIVE
WHEN I FIRST HEARD THIS

WATCH V
I'M A SENIOR UNDERGRAD RIGHT NOW AND I'M STARTING TO REACH THE SINGULARITY ALL OF MY CLASSES ARE STARTING TO BLEND INTO EACH OTHER BUT I DON'T THINK THAT HAPPENS ON TOO GRAND OF A SCALE FOCUSING ON THE COUPLE OF OVERLAPS MAKES MORE SENSE
I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS EVER HAPPENS WHERE EVERYTHING ABSOLUTELY MESHES TOGETHER PERFECTLY AND THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE BECAUSE THESE THEORIES CONTRADICT EACH OTHER YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF CLASSICAL EM WILL NEVER MESH WITH YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF QUANTUM MECHANICS BECAUSE CLASSICAL EM IS WRONG

I IMAGINE YOU HAVE A DECENTLY MESHED UNDERSTANDING OF CLASSICAL MECHANICS AND CLASSICAL EM BECAUSE THESE MAKE SENSE ON A HUMAN INTUITIVE LEVEL WITH REGARD TO QUANTUM MECHANICS IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND THE STUFF I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I REALLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS GOING ON UNTIL I HAD TAKEN A COURSE IN COMPLEX ANALYSIS AND A COURSE IN LINEAR ALGEBRA MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS REALLY HELPED ME TO REGARD QUANTUM AS AN ABSTRACT MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORK RATHER THAN ENDLESSLY TRYING TO IMAGINE QUANTUM STATES VISUALLY IN MY HEAD THEY'RE JUST NUMBERS

I THINK COSMOLOGISTS AND AFT THEORISTS PROBABLY ARE THE CLOSEST TO HAVING A TOTALLY MESHED CONCEPT OF PHYSICS IN THEIR HEADS BUT EVEN THEN THEY WOULD PROBABLY NEVER SAY IT ALL MAKES SENSE OR ELSE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE A JOB

EDIT GOING OFF OF WHAT SOMEONE SAID BELOW THE ONLY THING ALL OF THE FIELDS HAVE IN COMMON IS MATHEMATICS ONCE YOU REALLY UNDERSTAND ALL THE MATH THEN YOU WILL BE ABLE TO DRAW ANALOGIES BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT FIELDS AND MAKE SOME SENSE OF THEM AS A WHOLE
SOME PIECES FELT INTO PLACE AS I DID SOME GRADUATED COURSES
GR AFT 2 AND SUSY AND NOW QI WHEN YOU SEE IT ALL TOGETHER CONNECTED

THE PROBLEM OF THIS MODULE BASED SYSTEM IS THAT ITS INDEED ALL SCATTERED AND FEELS UNCONNECTED BUT ITS ALL CONNECTED AND ALL NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING IN PHYSICS

SO FOR SOMETHING YOU COULD NEED STATISTICS QUANTUM AND A BIT OF ELECTRODYNAMICS AND THEN A BIT OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS AND BOOM YOU GOT IT

WHEN DOES IT STOP
WHEN I WAS INTRODUCED TO STRING THEORY

GIVES A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FRESH AND HONEST PICTURE OF ALL THE BIZARRE CONSTRUCTIONS OF AFT RENORMALIZATION SPECIAL GENERAL RELATIVITY QUANTUM MECHANICS NOT REALLY SURE HOW TO EXPLAIN IT BUT IT MAKES EVERYTHING LOOK FAMILIAR
ONCE I FIND A WAY TO RELATE A PHYSICS CONCEPT TO SOMETHING I ALREADY THINK IS INTERESTING IT BECOMES A LOT EASIER TO UNDERSTAND IF I CAN'T THEN IT'S A LOT HARDER I SUSPECT THAT IT'S THAT WAY FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE WHETHER THEY REALIZE IT OR NOT THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT'S EASIER TO THROW INFORMATION AT PEOPLE AND HOPE SOMETHING STICKS THAN IT IS TO MAKE THEM WANT TO LEARN MORE OF THEIR OWN ACCORD IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE PIECES NOT COMING TOGETHER TRY AND THINK OF WAYS THAT THE MATERIAL COULD BE RELATABLE TO YOU OR AT LEAST SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN AND EXPLORE
I FOUND THEY FELL INTO PLACE BY THE END OF EACH YEAR CERTAINLY WITH THE CORE MODULES THIS WAS SO BUT THE OPTION MODULES WERE A LITTLE MORE TANGENTIAL THE MORE READING AROUND THE TOPICS YOU DO THE MORE CONNECTIONS YOU'LL FIND BUT THAT IS MORE TO DO WITH THE NATURE OF PHYSICS THAN ANYTHING ELSE
THIS COULD BE ARROGANCE ON MY PART BUT I FEEL LIKE I'VE GOT A GOOD HANDLE ON THE STATE OF RESEARCH THE LIMITS OF KNOWLEDGE FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF FIELDS I WOULD ASCRIBE THIS TO CONVERSATIONS WITH MY PROFESSORS SOME SEMINAR CLASSES BUT MOSTLY WIKIPEDIA WIKIPEDIA IS A FANTASTIC TOOL FOR GAINING UNDERSTANDINGS OF A WIDE VARIETY OF FIELDS SIMPLY BEING FAMILIAR WITH THE NAMES AND SUBJECTS DEALT WITH IN DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF PHYSICS CAN BE USEFUL WHEN CONFRONTING A NEW PROBLEM IT GIVES YOU THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO ASK QUESTIONS OR LEARN MORE ON YOUR OWN IT HELPS COMBAT THE FEELING OF OH SHIT I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO START

ANYWAY I'M NOT SURE THAT'S THE ANSWER YOU WERE LOOKING FOR BUT I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH MY FAVORITE WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE THE LIST OF UNSOLVED PROBLEMS IN PHYSICS
NOT A GRAD STUDENT STILL IN UNDERGRAD BOONG AN ASSOCIATE OF SCIENCE IN PHYSICS AND THERE WAS A POINT IN CLASS WHERE I SAW SOME FORMULA THAT AT FIRST DIDN'T MAKE SENSE THEN ABOUT A GOOD 2 MINUTES OF JUST LOOKING AT IT AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WAS ALL THE PIECES JUST STARTED TO FALL INTO PLACE AND I WAS ABLE TO START USING ONE FORMULA AND THEN JUMP TO THE NEXT AND THE NEXT SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME IN COMMUTER SCIENCE WE WERE STUDYING SOME PROBLEMS THAT WE HAD TO MAKE A PROGRAM TO SOLVE AND AFTER LOOKING AT IT FOR A FEW DAYS ALL OF A SUDDEN I WAS ABLE TO WRITE THE CODE THAT SOLVED THE PROBLEMS AND EVERYTHING AFTER WAS JUST SO EASY TO ME IT JUST TOOK TIME FOR THE PIECES TO FIND THERE PLACE AND THEN BOOM IT FALLS AND EVERYTHING AROUND IT STARTS TO FIT INTO ITS SPOT AND IT ALL STARTS TO MAKE SENSE
DID SEMESTERS OF UNDERGRAD REALLY STARTED DOING POORLY IN MY 3RD SEMESTER BUT I MANAGED DOING A MASTERS IN SEMICONDUCTORS WE USE BASICALLY EVERYTHING I LEARNED IN UNDERGRAD MANY THINGS HAVE BEEN CLICKING INTO PLACE AS TOPICS GET REHASHED AND WE GO DEEPER INTO THE MEAT OF IT

FOR EXAMPLE I NEVER REALLY UNDERSTOOD DIELECTRIC BEHAVIOR IT IS STILL FUZZY BUT I DO HAVE A BETTER GRIP AFTER MY OPTOELECTRONIC COURSE WE CAME TO THE COMPLEX DIELECTRIC CONSTANT VIA A LORENTZ OSCILLATOR LOOKING AT THAT IN DETAIL REALLY HELPED

WE BASICALLY DO CLASSIC MECHANICS TO MAKE A BASIC MODEL TEASE IT INTO QUANTUM FORM TO GET THE REAL BEHAVIOR EM TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS USEFUL FOR

UNDERGRAD ISN'T REALLY ABOUT HAVING EVERYTHING IN A NEAT LITTLE PACKAGE IT IS LIKE READING THE USER MANUAL FOR ALL THE TOOLS IN A LARGE TOOLKIT THAT WILL USE LATER BUT YOU STILL DON'T HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH THEM TO KNOW THEM ON A PERSONAL LEVEL I KNOW TOOLS DON'T HAVE PERSONALITY BUT YOU KNOW WHEN SOMEONE SAYS AH WITH THIS DRILL YOU HAVE TO WIGGLE THIS SWITCH TO GET IT TO WORK RIGHT THAT COMES LATER AFTER YOU HAVE USED THE STUFF FOR A WHILE
IN SECOND YEAR I TOOK A COUPLE OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS MODULES WHICH COVERED PRINCIPLE AND LAGRANGIAN MECHANICS I ALSO READ THE FEYNMAN LECTURES ON PHYSICS WHICH CEMENTED INTO PLACE THE IDEA THAT IF YOU START WITH A SMALL ENOUGH RULE YOU CAN APPLY IT TO SITUATIONS UNTIL YOU'VE DESCRIBED REALITY THE REASON I LIKED THE FEYNMAN LECTURES IS BECAUSE HE STARTS OFF WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT ATOMS EXIST AND USE THIS TO EXPLAIN ALL KINDS OF PHYSICAL PHENOMENA AND FINISHES ALONG THE LINES OF IF WE UNDERSTAND BY WHAT RULES ATOMS INTERACT WE CAN EXPLAIN HOW EVERYTHING MADE OF ATOMS WILL BEHAVE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH WHEN IT CLICKED FOR ME IF YOU ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY TRY READING AROUND THE SUBJECT WITH MORE WIDTH DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT MINDS SO WILL NEED A DIFFERENT PROMPT TO MAKE IT CLICK
I'M AND THINGS CLICKED FOR ME LAST YEAR
AS A SMALL BABY PHYSICIST AT THE MOMENT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS THE START OF MY COURSE HAS BEEN SELF-CONTAINED BITS AND PIECES FROM ALL OVER PHYSICS WITH JUST ENOUGH TANTALISING LINKS BETWEEN THEM THAT I JUST KNOW EVENTUALLY GOING TO CLICK THEY'VE TAUGHT ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM SOMEWHAT SEPARATELY AND ONLY AT THE END DID THEY BEGIN TO CROSSOVER ALONG WITH THIS LITTLE BITS OF THOSE COURSES SUBTLY POP UP IN PHOTONIC LECTURES I'M SO PUMPED TO GET STUCK IN AND START MASHING EVERYTHING TOGETHER I ABSOLUTELY CANNOT WAIT

EDIT TO ACTUALLY ANSWER THE QUESTION I DON'T KNOW WHEN BUT FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THE MATHS WILL START TO CROSS OVER IN A BIG WAY
GRAD SCHOOL I'M NOT SURE WHY OR EVEN WHAT I DID THAT REALLY SPARKED THE CHANGE I CAN SAY I WAS FORCED TO DO REALLY DIFFICULT PROBLEMS PROJECTS AND MY UNDERSTANDING WAS CHALLENGED OFTEN SO I SPENT SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF TIME STUDYING FAR MORE THAN UNDERGRAD ONE DAY IN STAT MECH I REALIZED HOW FAR I'VE COME BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO MAKE CONNECTIONS WITH MANY OTHER BRANCHES OF PHYSICS
OP I THINK TAKING A LOOK AT YOUR GENERAL CONCEPT OF SCIENCE MATH AND WHAT A UNIVERSAL THEORY WOULD LOOK LIKE MIGHT HELP THE STRUCTURE OF SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTIONS IS GOOD AS IS AGAINST METHOD TO SEE THE OVERARCHING IDEA OF SCIENCE AS A MONOLITHIC ENTITY COMPRESSES THE COMPLEX CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL HUMAN ELEMENTS OF SCIENCE AS THE PRACTICE OF DISCOVERING THE WORLD AROUND US THESE SEEMINGLY RANDOM PUZZLES AND MODULES ARE A PART OF A LANGUAGE CREATED BY MAN FROM WHAT HE'S OBSERVED OVER TIME THEY ARE STORIES WITH SUBJECTS AND SYNTAX YOU OBVIOUSLY SPEAK THE LANGUAGE BETTER THAN YOU GIVE YOURSELF CREDIT AS YOU CAN SUCCESSFULLY PASS CLASSES AND TESTAMENT THE INTRO TO QUARK AND JAGUAR IS A QUICK SYNOPSIS OF THE BEAUTY OF UNIVERSAL DESIGN AND THE OVERLAP OF BIOLOGY PHYSICS AND MATH IN THEIR NARRATIVE AND CREATION OF IT

EDITED TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION GRAD SCHOOL NOT A STEM MAJOR MA IN PHILOSOPHY AMAZING PASSIONATE PROFESSORS HELP PICKY THEIR BRAINS
PROBABLY WHEN I GOT A GRASP OF THE FOUR MAJOR CATEGORIES OF THEORIES

QUANTUM

RELATIVISTIC

CLASSICAL

ELECTROMAGNETISM

MOST ALL PHYSICS FITS INTO THESE CATEGORIES NOW THAT I'VE SEEN ENOUGH OF EACH I CAN SEE AN EQUATION AND UNDERSTAND WHERE IT COMES FROM THERE'S A LOT OF OVERLAP WHEN IT COMES TO FIELD THEORIES WHICH IS DEFINITELY COOL

THE STUFF I'M LEARNING RIGHT NOW PHYSICS III IS SO BASIC THAT IT'S JUST A TINY SUBSET OF THOSE THINGS SO MANY EMPIRICAL EQUATIONS THAT I HARDLY CONSIDER IT PHYSICS

NOW THAT I HAVE THIS WHOLE PICTURE I DON'T STRESS AS MUCH LEARNING THE WHY SOMETHING IS THE WAY IT IS I CAN GLANCE AT THE REASONING AND UNDERSTAND WHY THE END EQUATION IS WHAT IT IS THAT HELPS A LOT WHEN I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY AN EQUATION IS WHAT IT IS AND THINKING TO MYSELF NOW WHAT ASSUMPTIONS DID THEY MAKE

DDK WHY I'M GETTING DOWNVOTES EVERYTHING FROM PHYSICS COMES FROM BASIC ASSUMPTIONS AND PRETTY MUCH ALL OF MODERN PHYSICS COMES FROM THOSE FOUR MAJOR AREAS BUILD AN INTUITION FOR THOSE AND WHEN STUDYING ANY PHYSICS TOPIC HALF THE THINKING IS ALREADY DONE
YOU NEED TO KICK IT INTO HIGH GEAR YESTERDAY IF YOU WANT GRAD SCHOOL TO BE AN OPTION FOR YOU I'LL BE HONEST YOUR GA IS LOW RESEARCH EXPERIENCE IS A TOTALLY CRUCIAL PART OF YOUR APPLICATION YOU NEED AROUND THREE LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION SO YOU'VE GOT TO GET ON THAT IMMEDIATELY THE PHYSICS GRE IS A HUGE DEAL AND YOU STARTED PREPARING BY NOW

I THINK IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GO TO GRAD SCHOOL TAKING AN EXTRA YEAR OF UNDERGRAD AND MAKING UP FOR THE HOLES IN YOUR CV IS YOUR BEST OPTION

BUT I THINK YOU NEED TO LOOK DEEPLY AT WHETHER OR NOT GRAD SCHOOL IS EVEN A GOOD IDEA THE KIND OF BEHAVIOR THAT LED TO YOUR CURRENT SITUATION WILL NOT FARE WELL FOR YOU IN GRAD SCHOOL GRAD SCHOOL IS A HUGE STEP UP FROM UNDERGRAD IN COURSEWORK AND RESEARCH IS THIS SOMETHING YOU'RE REALLY PREPARED FOR
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU MEAN BY GRAD SCHOOL

YES PROBABLY IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A TOP RANKED PHD PROGRAM IN WHATEVER SPECIALIZATION YOU ARE MOST INTERESTED IN YOU MAY BE IN A CHALLENGING POSITION

THAT SAID I FINISHED MY B SOUTH IN ASTRO WITH RIGHT ABOUT A MAJOR GA MAYBE EVEN A DID JUST REALLY AWFULLY ON THE PHYSICS GRE DID ZERO UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH AND HAD ALMOST NO REAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH PHYSICS PROFESSORS IN SHORT WHAT YOU MIGHT EXPECT FROM SOMEONE WITH A COMPLETELY UNRELATED SECOND MAJOR AND NO INTEREST IN GRAD SCHOOL DURING UNDERGRAD

AFTER TAKING ABOUT 2 YEARS OFF I ENROLLED IN A STATE SCHOOL MASCULINE SOUTH PROGRAM I GRADUATED WITH MY MASCULINE SOUTH IN MEDICAL PHYSICS A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO AND AM CURRENTLY INTERNING AT THE IAEA LABORATORIES OUTSIDE VIENNA WORKING ON PRETTY RELEVANT AND INTERESTING THINGS

I UNDERSTAND THE CULTURE OF GRADUATE SCHOOL PHYSICS IS VERY COMPETITIVE ABOUT AWARDS AND PUBLICATIONS AND PLACEMENT AND ALL THAT AND IF THAT IS THE SORT OF THING YOU ARE TRYING TO PURSUE YOU MAY WANT TO SERIOUSLY THINK ABOUT WHY YOU WANT TO PURSUE PHYSICS AND WHAT IT MEANS THAT YOU ARE WHERE YOU ARE

HOWEVER IF WHAT YOU WANT IS TO TEACH STUDY AND DO RESEARCH IN PHYSICS THAT IS ABSOLUTELY SOMETHING YOU CAN DO WITH YOUR LIFE

ALSO MAN MAYBE EXPERIENCES DIFFER AND I CERTAINLY WENT FOR APPLIED AND NOT THEORETICAL OR EXPERIMENTAL WORK BUT GRAD SCHOOL WAS NOT A STEP UP IN COURSEWORK IN MY ANECDOTAL EXPERIENCE THIS MAY NOT BE REPRESENTATIVE THOUGH
EVERYTHING ROBUS SAID IN DOUBLE

YOUR CHANCES OF GRAD SCHOOL AREN'T ENTIRELY SHOT THROUGH BUT YOUR CHANCES OF A GOOD GRAD SCHOOL MIGHT BE YOU NEED TO THINK CLEARLY ON WHY YOU WANT TO GO TO GRAD SCHOOL WHAT YOU HOPE TO GET OUT OF IT AND HOW YOU THINK IT WILL BE ANY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU'VE GOTTEN YOURSELF INTO NOW

IF YOU'RE REALLY COMMITTED TO GOING TO GRAD SCHOOL YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO HELP AN ADMISSIONS COMMITTEE FIGURE OUT THE ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS YOU'LL ABSOLUTELY NEED TO TAKE THAT FOURTH YEAR BECAUSE YOU NEED THE RESEARCH EXPERIENCE YOU NEED LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION WHY IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH PROFESSORS SEVERELY LACKING YOU WANT THE SAME CREDENTIAL AS THEM AND YET IN THREE YEARS YOU'VE NEVER TRIED TO ASK ANY OF THEM ABOUT IT AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PRACTICE TO THE POINT WHERE YOU'RE NEAR PERFECT ON THE PHYSICS GRE IF YOU'VE FINISHED ALL THE UG COURSES TAKE ANY GRADUATE COURSES THEY OFFER AND ACE THEM THE FEAR WITH A LOW GA IS AN INABILITY TO MAKE IT THROUGH GRADUATE COURSEWORK A SECOND MAJOR DOESN'T HELP PASSING GRADUATE COURSEWORK IN PHYSICS MIGHT

FINALLY IF YOU'RE COMMITTED TO GRADUATING NOW THEN MAYBE MILITARY OR OTHER PUBLIC SERVICE CAN IMPROVE YOUR APPLICATION A BIT IF YOU'RE A US CITIZEN BUT A PHD IS AN ACADEMIC DEGREE MOSTLY THE THING THAT DETERMINES IF YOU'RE A GOOD PHD PROGRAM CANDIDATE IS IF YOU WERE CONSISTENTLY VERY GOOD OR AT THE VERY LEAST CONSISTENTLY IMPROVING IN YOUR PREVIOUS ACADEMIC DEGREE
THE GA AT IS NOT A WASH OUT AND THE UNDERGRADUATE GA IS NOT THE ONLY INDICATOR OF TALENT OR PREDICTOR OF LATER SUCCESS IF YOU FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT CONTINUING TO THE PHD TRY TO OPTIMIZE YOUR GRE PERFORMANCE AND TRY TO GET INVOLVED IN RESEARCH IN A TOPIC THAT SEEMS INTERESTING AND WITH SOMEONE WHO COULD AND WOULD ADVOCATE FOR YOU THE QUESTION OF WHETHER A FOURTH YEAR MAKES YOU A STRONGER CANDIDATE IS A GOOD TOPIC TO DISCUSS WITH YOUR NEW RESEARCH ADVISOR
I'LL GIVE IT A GO SORRY IF IT GETS A LITTLE LONG AND OR RAMBLING BUT YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT PRETTY DEEP SUBJECTS

VIRTUAL PARTICLES AND PERTURBATION THEORY VIRTUAL PARTICLES ARE MATHEMATICAL TERMS THAT ARISE WHEN YOU DO PERTURBATION THEORY BASICALLY IN A FREE AFT THAT IS ONE WITHOUT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE FIELDS YOU CAN FIND THE ENERGY EIGENSTATE AND THEY LOOK LIKE PARTICLES YOU HAVE STATES OF DEFINITE MOMENTUM AND YOU CAN PUT AN INTEGER NUMBER OF EXCITATIONS IN THESE STATES IN OTHER WORDS YOUR TYPICAL EIGENSTATE LOOKS LIKE UNIT OF MOMENTUM UNITS OF MOMENTUM P2 2 UNITS OF MOMENTUM P3 ETC THESE UNITS ARE WHAT WE USUALLY CALL PARTICLES THOUGH AS IN REGULAR QM THEY'RE SPREAD OUT OVER ALL SPACE

WHEN YOU INTRODUCE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE FIELDS YOU STILL HAVE THESE PARTICLES AS APPROXIMATE EIGENSTATE AT TIMES MUCH BEFORE OR AFTER YOUR INTERACTION BUT WHILE THE INTERACTION IS HAPPENING THIS PICTURE KIND OF BREAKS DOWN A LITTLE WHAT WE DO IS PERTURBATION THEORY TO CALCULATE THE PROBABILITY OF DIFFERENT TRANSITIONS HAPPENING YOU SUM OVER A SET OF INTERMEDIATE STATES LIKE IN PERTURBATION THEORY IN QM THESE INTERMEDIATE STATES ARE JUST LIKE PARTICLES WITH TWO EXCEPTIONS ONE IS THAT THEY CAN HAVE ANY MASS AT ALL WHILE NORMAL PARTICLES HAVE A FIXED MASS LIKE THE PHOTON BEING MASSLESS THE OTHER IS THAT THEY ARE UNOBSERVABLE BY DEFINITION SINCE THEY ARE A MATHEMATICAL CONVENIENCE THAT ARISES WHEN DOING PERTURBATION THEORY NOT ACTUAL PARTICLES THEREFORE WE CALL THEM VIRTUAL PARTICLES AND DRAW THEM IN LITTLE DIAGRAMS THAT HELP US REMEMBER THE FORMULAS



OFF SHELL REFERS TO THE MASS SHELL I EAST THE HYPERSURFACE E 2 P 2 M 2 WITH C IN SPACE IT'S A 3D HYPERSURFACE BUT IF YOU PICTURE SPACETIME AS BEING THREE-DIMENSIONAL IT'S A HYPERBOLOID AN PARTICLE HAS A WHOSE SQUARE IS ITS MASS AN OR VIRTUAL PARTICLE DOESN'T FOR EXAMPLE ALL REAL PHOTONS OBEY E PHOTONS DON'T THEIR ENERGY AND MOMENTUM CAN TAKE ANY VALUES AGAIN THEY AREN'T REAL PARTICLES YOU'LL NEVER SEE AN PHOTON IN A DETECTOR



SECOND QUANTIZATION IS NOTHING MORE THAN A FORMALISM FOR DESCRIBING STATES WITH IDENTICAL PARTICLES SEE THIS EXCELLENT ANSWER AT WHICH EXPLAINS IT BETTER THAN I EVER COULD SECOND QUANTIZATION DOESN'T CARE ABOUT WHICH KIND OF PARTICLES VIRTUAL OR REAL YOU'RE DESCRIBING IT'S NOT REALLY SECOND QUANTIZATION THAT REQUIRES PARTICLES TO BE EIGENSTATE OF THE HAMILTONIAN RATHER PARTICLES ARE THE EIGENSTATE OF THE HAMILTONIAN YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CHOICE AND WHILE YOU CAN'T HAVE HALF A PHOTON I DON'T SEE WHY THERE'S A NEED FOR SMALLER UNITS OF ENERGY YOU COULD ALWAYS HAVE A PHOTON WITH HALF THE ENERGY



I KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT AFT BUT I THINK SOME MATHEMATICAL WORK HAS BEEN DONE IN LOWER DIMENSIONS THE MOST IMPORTANT EXAMPLE HOWEVER IS LATTICE CD WHERE INSTEAD OF DOING PERTURBATION THEORY YOU DISCRETIVE SPACETIME AND CALCULATE PATH INTEGRALS THAT WAY



PATH INTEGRALS AND HAMILTONIAN THERE ARE TWO DISTINCTIONS HERE ONE IS PATH INTEGRAL VS OPERATORS AND THE OTHER IS LAGRANGIAN VS HAMILTONIAN THEY ARE RELATED BUT SEPARATE THE PATH INTEGRAL IS MOSTLY USED IN PLACE OF OPERATORS THOUGH NOT ALWAYS NOT BY A LONG SHOT BECAUSE IT'S EASIER FOR THEORETICAL CALCULATIONS THE FORMALISM OF FEYNMAN DIAGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE POPS RIGHT OUT WHILE WITH OPERATORS IT'S A BIT MORE WORK REGARDING THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE THE LAGRANGIAN IS MOSTLY USED IN AFT BECAUSE IT'S LORENTZ INVARIANT WHILE THE HAMILTONIAN IS NOT AND IF YOU'RE USING THE LAGRANGIAN IT'S OFTEN MORE CONVENIENT TO PUT IT IN A PATH INTEGRAL



VIRTUAL PARTICLES AND DESTRUCTIVE INTERFERENCE WE'RE GETTING INTO TRICKY TERRAIN HERE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY KNOW ABOUT THIS SUBJECT OFTEN DISAGREE ON HOW TO INTERPRET VIRTUAL PARTICLES SO TAKE EVERYTHING I SAY WITH A GRAIN OF SALT

I THINK WHAT TRYING TO SAY IS THAT THE PROBABILITY TO OBSERVE AN PARTICLE AND OR AN ENERGY NONCONSERVATION I'M NOT TOO CLEAR ON WHETHER THESE ARE ACTUALLY POSSIBLE IS NEGLIGIBLE FOR THE SCATTERING EXPERIMENTS WE ACTUALLY DO WHERE WE CONSIDER THE PARTICLES TO BE EIGENSTATE OF THE FREE HAMILTONIAN AS T GOES TO INFINITY I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF DESTRUCTIVE INTERFERENCE THIS IS



PHASE VELOCITY I KNOW EVEN LESS ABOUT THIS TOPIC BUT WHAT WOULD IT MEAN TO HAVE A NEGATIVE PHASE VELOCITY OPPOSITE TO MOMENTUM EITHER WAY ALL I KNOW FOR SURE IS THAT TRYING TO TREAT VIRTUAL PARTICLES AS REAL PARTICLES IS DANGEROUS THIS IS DONE SOMETIMES WHEN HANDWAVING BUT I WOULDN'T READ TOO MUCH INTO WHAT WIKIPEDIA SAYS VIRTUAL PARTICLES CAN INDEED HAVE ANY ENERGY AT ALL BUT SINCE THEY AREN'T ACTUALLY PARTICLES THAT'S ALL RIGHT



PLEASE ASK IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE I'M JUST A HUMBLE STUDENT WHO SORT OF MANAGED TO LEARN AFT ON THEIR OWN FROM VARIOUS BOOKS AND INTERNET RESOURCES SO I COULD BE WRONG ABOUT MANY THINGS I THINK WHAT I SAID REFLECTS THE GENERAL CONSENSUS THOUGH ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO DELICATE TOPICS LIKE VIRTUAL
WHAT IS THE RELATION BETWEEN PERTURBATION THEORY AND VIRTUAL PARTICLES

YOUR NOTION FROM NONRELATIVISTIC QUANTUM MECHANICS IS CORRECT AND IT CARRIES OVER TO FIELD THEORY WITH FEW MODIFICATIONS TO GO STRAIGHT TO THE POINT WHEN YOU DEVELOP A PERTURBATION THEORY FOR FIELD THEORIES YOU TYPICALLY THINK OF SCATTERING PROBLEMS SINCE THEY ARE THE EXPERIMENTALLY RELEVANT APPLICATION OF FIELD THEORY

YOU START WITH AN INITIAL STATE THAT LOOKS LIKE THE STATE OF THE FREE INTERACTIONLESS THEORY WHICH YOU KNOW HOW TO SOLVE SOMETHING HAPPENS AND YOU END UP WITH A FINAL STATE THAT ALSO LOOKS LIKE A STATE FROM THE FREE THEORY THE SOMETHING HAPPENS IS TYPICALLY EXPRESSED IN A DIAGRAMMATIC LANGUAGE THAT CAN BE HEURISTICALLY IDENTIFIED WITH PROCESSES INVOLVING PARTICLES

FOR EXAMPLE IF AN ELECTRON SCATTERS OFF A NUCLEUS PEOPLE WILL OFTEN SAY THAT THE ELECTRON APPROACHES EXCHANGES A VIRTUAL PHOTON AND MOVES AWAY WHAT THEY MEAN IS THAT WHEN DOING THE CALCULATION IN PERTURBATION THEORY THE RELEVANT DIAGRAM WILL HAVE AN INTERNAL LINE THAT HAS SIMILAR PROPERTIES TO THE PHOTON

IT'S IMPORTANT NOT TO TAKE THIS PICTURE TOO LITERALLY HOWEVER OFTEN INDIVIDUAL FEYNMAN DIAGRAMS WILL BREAK SYMMETRIES OF NATURE AND SOMETIMES PARTICULARLY IN NONABELIAN GAUGE THEORIES THEY WILL EVEN INCLUDE FICTITIOUS GHOST PARTICLES WITH IMPOSSIBLE PROPERTIES THAT COME FROM TRICKS THAT MAKE THE CALCULATION WORK PROPERLY THEY HAVE TO BE THERE IN THE DIAGRAM BUT IT'S HARD TO SEE THEM AS BEING PHYSICAL WHAT IS PHYSICAL IS THE SUM OF ALL DIAGRAMS AT ANY GIVEN ORDER IN PERTURBATION THEORY

IS THE PHRASE USED AS AN ANALOGY TO ELECTRON SHELLS IF SO WHAT SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THESE SYSTEMS EXIST

NUMBER SHELL IS JUST MASS SHELL THE HYPERBOLOID OF POSSIBLE MOMENTA FOR A PHYSICAL PARTICLE BEING JUST MEANS THAT THESE VIRTUAL PARTICLES DON'T RESPECT THE USUAL DISPERSION RELATIONS FOR THAT PARTICLE THIS IS UNSURPRISING SINCE AS I EXPLAINED ABOVE YOU SHOULDN'T TAKE THE ANALOGY TOO LITERALLY

IS THERE A CONNECTION BETWEEN VIRTUAL PARTICLES AND SECOND QUANTIZATION

SECOND QUANTIZATION IS THE BEGINNING OF THE FIELD THEORY STORY AND IN THIS FORMALISM THE PERTURBATIVE EXPANSION LOOKS VERY SUGGESTIVE WHEN VIEWED IN TERMS OF VIRTUAL PARTICLES BUT OTHER THAN THAT THEY'RE UNRELATED CONCEPTS

PARTICLE IS JUST A NAME BY THE WAY WHAT IT MEANS IS EIGENSTATE OF THE HAMILTONIAN BUT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION NUMBER VIRTUAL PARTICLES ARE JUST AS QUANTIZED AS REAL ONES WHICH AGAIN IS SOMETHING THAT YOU SEE IN THE SECOND QUANTIZED FORM OF FIELD THEORY A HEADS UP THOUGH THE TERM SECOND QUANTIZATION TENDS TO APPEAR MORE AMONG MANY BODY THEORISTS AND NUCLEAR PHYSICISTS WHILE FIELD THEORISTS PREFER THE TERM CANONICAL QUANTIZATION IT'S THE SAME THING

ARE THERE APPROACHES TO AFT THAT DON'T USE VIRTUAL PARTICLES WHAT REPLACES THEIR EXISTENCE IN THESE THEORIES

YES THE PROTOTYPICAL EXAMPLE ARE LATTICE APPROACHES YOU DISCRETIVE SPACETIME AND TURN YOUR FIELDS INTO VARIABLES LIVING ON EACH SITE YOU ARE THEN FREE TO EVALUATE PATH INTEGRAL BY MONTE CARLO SIMULATION FOR INSTANCE YOU GENERATE AN ENSEMBLE OF FIELD CONFIGURATIONS OR TRAJECTORIES IF YOU WANT TO THINK OF THE PATH INTEGRAL FOR SIMPLICITY AND SUM OVER THOSE THE APPROACH IS FULLY SINCE THE PATH INTEGRAL IS EVALUATED DIRECTLY AND THERE'S NOTHING IN IT ANALOGOUS TO THE CONCEPT OF VIRTUAL PARTICLE WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH EXCLUSIVE TO PERTURBATION THEORY

OFTEN EVEN WHEN DOING PERTURBATIVE CALCULATIONS WE DON'T BOTHER WITH VIRTUAL PARTICLES EITHER SINCE DIAGRAMMATIC EXPANSIONS AREN'T THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH EVERY PROBLEM FOR EXAMPLE LET'S SAY THAT YOU'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE VACUUM RESPONDS TO AN EXTERNAL MAGNETIC FIELD OR YOU WANT TO CALCULATE THE ZERO POINT ENERGY IN THE CASIMIR EFFECT YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH JUST WRITE DOWN THE PATH INTEGRAL IN THE FIRST CASE OR THE VACUUM ENERGY IN THE SECOND AND JUST DO THE CALCULATION IN THE FIRST CASE YOU EVALUATE A FUNCTIONAL DETERMINANT WHICH CAN BE DONE EAST G BY USING AN ANALOGUE OF THE RIEMANN ZETA FUNCTION AND IN THE SECOND YOU CAN JUST SUM UP THE ZERO POINT ENERGIES FOR EACH MODE WHICH IS WRITTEN IN TERMS OF THE SUM OF INTEGERS WHICH IS ALSO RELATED TO THE RIEMANN ZETA FUNCTION

IT TURNS OUT THAT ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION IS HARD BECAUSE EACH APPROACH MAY BE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AND SINCE VIRTUAL PARTICLES AREN'T REALLY PHYSICAL THEY NEED NOT CORRESPOND TO ANYTHING IN A DIFFERENT FORMALISM

WHY ARE PATH INTEGRALS USED IN AFT RATHER THAN HAMILTONIAN AS IN GRIFFITHS

BECAUSE IT'S EASIER PARTICULARLY FOR GAUGE THEORIES

FIRST THE PATH INTEGRAL RESPECTS THE THEORY'S LORENTZ INVARIANCE WHEREAS THE HAMILTONIAN FORMULATION BREAKS IT SO YOU BETTER CHECK AT THE END THAT YOU GOT A LORENTZ INVARIANT RESULT

SECOND THE STANDARD MODEL IS A GAUGE THEORY THIS MEANS THAT WHEN YOU QUANTIZE IT YOU HAVE TO BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL IN PROPERLY ACCOUNTING FOR THE MANY REDUNDANT PARAMETERIZATIONS OF THE SAME THING TWO FIELD CONFIGURATIONS THAT LOOK DIFFERENT MAY BE RELATED BY A GAUGE TRANSFORMATION AND THUS BE COMPLETELY EQUIVALENT IN THE PATH INTEGRAL FORMULATION THERE ARE RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD METHODS FOR PICKING A GAUGE AND ENSURING THAT THE END RESULT IS GAUGE INVARIANT

IN THE EARLY DAYS OF FIELD THEORY THIS WAS A CHALLENGE SINCE THE SAME PERTURBATIVE CALCULATIONS THAT HAD BEEN DONE SUCCESSFULLY IN QED SEEMED TO FAIL GIVING ANSWERS THIS MADE IT UNCLEAR HOW TO CONSISTENTLY QUANTIZE THEORY THE ISSUE WAS RESOLVED WHEN FADEEV AND POPOV POINTED OUT THAT THIS PICKING OF A GAUGE REQUIRED NOTHING MORE COMPLICATED THAN INTRODUCING THE APPROPRIATE JACOBIAN IN THE PATH INTEGRAL AND THE REST IS HISTORY

NOW IN BOOKS PARTICULARLY OLDER ONES YOU MAY SEE QED CANONICALLY QUANTIZED BUT YOU'LL NEVER SEE CD CANONICALLY QUANTIZED BECAUSE NO ANALOGUE OF THE ABOVE TRICK EXISTS I'M SURE IT'S POSSIBLE TO CANONICALLY QUANTIZE NONABELIAN GAUGE THEORY BUT IT'S TECHNICALLY MORE INVOLVED

ALSO THE FEYNMAN PATH INTEGRAL OPENS THE PATH TO NUMERICAL SIMULATION AS I MENTIONED ABOVE

FROM WIKIPEDIA
THE PROBABILITY AMPLITUDE FOR A VIRTUAL PARTICLE TO EXIST TENDS TO BE CANCELED OUT BY DESTRUCTIVE INTERFERENCE OVER LONGER DISTANCES AND TIMES

THAT'S JUST TECHNOBABBLE AN AMPLITUDE FOR A PARTICLE TO EXIST IS NOT REALLY A MEANINGFUL CONCEPT IN THE SENSE BEING USED HERE OPERATIONALLY SPEAKING A PARTICLE EXISTS IF IT CAN BE DETECTED BUT A VIRTUAL PARTICLE CANNOT EVER BE DETECTED BY DEFINITION IT IS ALWAYS AN INTERNAL LINE IN A DIAGRAM WHEREAS THE EXTERNAL LINES ARE SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT INTERACTIONS WITH OUR DETECTORS

I'M REALLY REALLY STARTING TO REACH WITH THIS ONE BUT COULD THIS POSSIBLY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE WAVEFUNCTION HAVING A NEGATIVE PHASE VELOCITY

THE CONCEPT OF WAVEFUNCTION LOSES ITS MEANING IN FIELD THEORY SOME PARTICLES MASSLESS VECTOR PARTICLES SUCH AS PHOTONS DON'T EVEN HAVE A WAVEFUNCTION AT ALL THE NONRELATIVISTIC LIMIT OF RELATIVISTIC THEORIES IS ACTUALLY QUITE SUBTLE YOU'LL NEVER SEE FIELD THEORISTS SAY THAT THERE'S AN AMPLITUDE FOR A PARTICLE TO BE AT X THEY TAKE THE FIELD POINT OF VIEW SERIOUSLY AND TAKE THE FIELD AS THE ONTOLOGICALLY FUNDAMENTAL QUANTITY
GET THIS BOOK

ALSO THIS BOOK SEEMS GOOD GRANTED I KNEW AFT BY THE TIME I STARTED READING THAT BOOK

AFT IS HARD OBTAINING AN THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING IT IS PROBABLY THE HARDEST THING I'VE EVER ACCOMPLISHED IN MY LIFE TO BE HONEST NOTHING THAT CAN BE UNDERSTOOD VIA WORDS OR VERBAL EXPLANATIONS WILL LEAD YOU TO UNDERSTANDING AFT YOU HAVE TO WORK THROUGH THE MATHEMATICS THE WORDS WHICH WE USE TO DESCRIBE VIRTUAL PARTICLE FAIL THE CONCEPT SO MISERABLY THAT WE MIGHT AS WELL NOT TRY IN MY OPINION

IF IS THE FURTHEST YOU'LL GO IN QM AND AN UG BOOK IS THE FURTHEST YOU'LL GO IN CM YOU'LL HAVE A ROUGH TASK AHEAD OF YOU LUCKILY KLAUBER IS EXTREMELY THOROUGH AND WALKS YOU THROUGH EVERYTHING
YES THEY'RE WITHIN THE LAWS OF PHYSICS BUT SO IS TRAVELLING AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT

MATERIAL SCIENCE ENGINEERING IS NO WHERE NEAR AT THE LEVEL NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO BUILD SUCH A THING

SO YES TECHNICALLY ITS A PROBLEM OF ENGINEERING AND IS POSSIBLE BUT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR A FEW YEARS ATLEAST FOR THE TIME BEING ITS A TOTALLY SILLY IDEA

YOU SHOULD COMPLETELY FORGET ABOUT THE IDEA OF SPACE ELEVATORS JUST AS YOU SHOULD FORGET THE IDEA OF VISITING ALPHA CENTURI
CURRENTLY THE ONLY KNOWN MATERIAL THAT MAKES A SPACE ELEVATOR POSSIBLE IS CARBON NANOTUBES

RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO COST-EFFECTIVE WAY OF MASS PRODUCING THESE

LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR THIS SOLUTION FOR LOTS MORE REASONS THAN JUST THE SPACE ELEVATOR


WHAT PEOPLE USUALLY MEAN WHEN THEY SAY SPACE ELEVATOR IS A CONCEPT PROPOSED AS A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT IN THE VICTORIAN ERA NOT A REALISTIC ATTEMPT AT ENGINEERING

MORE REASONABLE IDEAS INCLUDE SHORTER TETHERS IN LOWER ORBITS WHICH YOU DOCK ONTO FROM A HIGH ALTITUDE PLANE ROTATING TETHERS THAT DIP INTO THE ATMOSPHERE BRIEFLY SEVERAL TIMES AS THEY ORBIT AROUND THE EARTH AND ORBITAL RINGS WHICH INVOLVE DEFLECTING BALLAST AROUND THE EARTH AT SLIGHTLY ABOVE ORBITAL VELOCITY TO SUPPORT SHORTER ELEVATOR CABLES ANOTHER CONCEPT CALLED THE LAUNCH LOOP IS CLOSELY RELATED IN NATURE TO ORBITAL RINGS BUT THE BALLAST IS DEFLECTED AROUND A SMALLER LOOP WITH A WIDE BASE ON THE GROUND AT EACH END

THE MAIN THING THAT SETS THESE REASONABLE SPACE ELEVATOR IDEAS APART FROM THE THOUGHT EXPERIMENT IS THAT THEY INVOLVE MUCH SHORTER CABLES AND STRUCTURES AND CAN WORK WITH MUCH LOWER TENSILE STRENGTH THUS THEY DO NOT HAVE TO BE MADE USING ATOMICALLY PURE CARBON NANOTUBES AND THE COMPLEXITY OF PREVENTING ISSUES LIKE RESONANT ENERGY BUILDUP IS LOWER
EVEN IF IT ISN'T POSSIBLE AT THE MOMENT IT WOULD DEFINEDLY ENABLE US TO DO SPACE MISSION FAR MORE EASY THAN WITHOUT AN ELEVATOR THE ELEVATOR WOULD REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY NEED TO SEND THINGS INTO SPACE CONSIDERABLY FROM USUALLY K PER KILOGRAM TO A VALUE WITH WOULD LAY IN BETWEEN A FEW TILL A FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS PER KILOGRAM ATM A DELTA ROCKET CAN LIFT KG FOR MIO WHICH IS ROUND ABOUT PER KG EVEN THE NEWEST ROCKETS CAN ONLY BRING THINGS UP TO THE LEO AT COSTS OF MIO FOR KG KG THIS IS THE REASON WHY SPACE STATIONS WHERE YOU HAVE HANGARS TO BUILD SPACE VEHICLES AREN'T AFFORDABLE BY CONVENTIONAL MEANS AS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR SUCH A STATION WOULD GO IN THE TRILLIONS WITH SOMETHING LIKE AN ELEVATOR WE COULD BUILD SUCH A STATION FOR APPROXIMATELY A FEW BILLIONS
BUZZ ALDRIN HAS SAID THAT ANY SPACE ELEVATOR WOULD BE DESTROYED BY ANY MICRONIZE GRAIN OF SPACE DUST UNLIKE A CRAFT WHICH CAN MANEUVER AWAY FROM IT A SPACE ELEVATOR WOULD JUST GET HIT AND POSSIBLY BE WEAKENED ENOUGH TO SNAP

HOW MANY TIMES WOULD A SPACE ELEVATOR CABLE WRAP AROUND THE EARTH NOT FULLY THEN THERE'S THE TRANSPORT VEHICLE THAT WOULD HAVE TO CLIMB IT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MS TO BE DONE IN A DAY A WEEK

A MORE REALISTIC ONE WOULD BE ONE ON THE MOON IT'S GOOD TO FIRST TRY IT SOMEPLACE ELSE

ALSO ANY TEAR IN THE CARBON NANOTUBE WOULD BE SEVERELY WEAKENED BY IT TO THE POINT IT MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE STRESSES ANY MORE
AXA WAS LOOKING INTO BUILDING A SPACE ELEVATOR BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THEY HAD ANY DESIGN PROPOSALS YET I PERSONALLY THINK THAT SKYHOOKS ARE MUCH MORE VIABLE THAN SPACE ELEVATORS

EDIT ACCORDING TO THIS BLURB AXA IS ON COURSE TO LAUNCH A MINIATURE SKYHOOK OF M LENGTH SOON
LIKELY IT IS POSSIBLE L1 SPACE ELEVATOR IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE

TO BE HONEST THOUGH I DON'T THINK THEY'RE LIKELY TO BE SENSIBLE GIVEN THEIR APPARENT FRAGILITY IT'D HAVE TO DODGE SPACE DEBRIS AND CLIMBERS SEEM TO ALWAYS FOCUS ON RELATIVELY SLOW S CLIMBING SPEEDS POWER IS ALSO SEPARATE AND YOU'RE NOT UP TO HIGH SPEEDS I EAST YOU CAN BE WELL INTO LEO AT S UP BUT YOU'RE STILL ONLY GOING A PATHETIC SPEEDS SOUTH I JUST USED THE SPEED OF A PERSON STANDING ON THE GROUND AT THE EQUATOR AT GEO YOU'RE KM FROM THE CENTER OF THE EARTH IT IS STILL ONLY SOUTH THIS TOOK DAYS

I THINK THE LAUNCH LOOP OR SOME KIND OF MASS STREAM LIKE THIS SEEMS LIKE A MUCH BETTER PROPOSITION TO ME LESS ON THE EDGE IN TERMS OF MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS BASICALLY GET THAT TO OR MORE UP WHERE YOU DON'T NEED AN EVACUATED TRACK JUST FOR THE MASS STREAM AND THEN HAVE A TRACK FOR THE CRAFT BRINGING IT UP TO S OR MORE IN A FAIRLY SHORT TIME THE TRACK CAN STILL BE IN ATMOSPHERE ENOUGH TO PROVIDE SOME PROTECTION IT IS LIKELY THAT MAINTAINANCE IS EASIER AND EVEN POSSIBLY USABLE AS TRAIN SYSTEM BETWEEN PLACES ON EARTH HANG BITS OF EVACUATED TUBE DOWN RUN THEM UNDERNEATH

AT S 2 IT TAKES OR WELL STILL IT WILL BE VERY LARGE MAKES ME WONDER IF A VACUUM TUNNEL AND USING MASS STREAMS TO JUST KEEP THE END ALOFT IS BETTER AT LEAST FOR SMALLER VERSIONS USABLE FOR SENDING HUMANS

AROUND THE TIME YOU BUILD IT YOU EXPECT SPACE INDUSTRY ETCETERA
WORTH IT IS AN EXTREMELY PERSONAL EVALUATION SO IT'S HARD TO SAY

AS A SENIOR IN HS YOU SHOULD JUST FOCUS ON FINISHING OUT WELL GETTING INTO THE SCHOOL YOU WANT AND ENJOYING YOURSELF

ALSO BEFORE GETTING TOO AHEAD OF YOURSELF JUST GETTING PHYSICS AND OR MATH MAJORS UNSCATHED IS A GOOD STEP HAVING THAT BACKGROUND ISN'T AS FOOLPROOF AS ENGINEERING BUT IF YOU FINISH A BACHELOR'S AND SAY NAH BRO TO GRAD SCHOOL YOU WON'T BE SUNK
MY ADVICE WOULD BE TO STUDY PHYSICS IN COLLEGE IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU REALLY LOVE IT AND ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT A COLLEGE PHYSICS EDUCATION IS THAT IT OPENS UP SO MANY DOORS WITH THE MATHEMATICAL TECHNICAL AND PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS THAT YOU TEND TO DEVELOP WHILE STUDYING PHYSICS YOU CAN TRANSITION TO ALMOST ANYTHING YOU WANT TO PEOPLE WHO STUDY PHYSICS GO ON TO BE PRACTICING PHYSICISTS IN HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT FIELDS OF COURSE BUT THEY ALSO MAKE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AT HEDGE FUNDS BECOME ENGINEERS AND EVEN DOCTORS I EVEN HAPPEN TO KNOW SOMEONE WHO WENT TO GRAD SCHOOL FOR PSYCHIATRY AFTER STUDYING PHYSICS IN COLLEGE

IN OTHER WORDS A PHYSICS EDUCATION PROVIDES AN AMAZING FOUNDATION FOR A GREAT MANY OTHER PROFESSIONS IT IS NOT VERY HARD TO GET INTO GRADUATE OR MEDICAL SCHOOL IN ANOTHER FIELD IF YOU DID WELL AS A PHYSICS MAJOR IN COLLEGE NOR IS IT HARD TO FIND A JOB IN MANY OTHER FIELDS THAT DON'T REQUIRE A HIGHER DEGREE IF YOU DECIDE MONEY IS YOUR PRIORITY IT'S OFTEN EASIER TO GET A JOB IN FINANCE WITH A BACKGROUND IN PHYSICS THAN IT IS IF YOU STUDIED BUSINESS OR EVEN ECONOMICS ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU STUDY SOMETHING THAT ISN'T CLOSELY RELATED TO PHYSICS LIKE ENGINEERING IT IS VERY HARD TO BREAK INTO PHYSICS

IF YOU STUDY PHYSICS YOU WILL LEARN WHETHER OR NOT YOU WANT TO PURSUE IT FURTHER AND YOU'LL HAVE A BETTER GRASP OF THE OPTIONS WITHIN THE FIELD THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU I WOULD NOT GET HUNG UP ON THE NUMBER RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THE FIELD IS HUGE AND AN AVERAGE IS A POOR REPRESENTATION OF THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO YOU ESPECIALLY IF YOU WORK IN INDUSTRY IN YEARS ALSO MIGHT SOUND FINE TO YOU IF YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING THAT YOU ABSOLUTELY LOVE AND IF YOU DECIDE THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO FOLLOW THAT ROAD YOU WILL HAVE OPENED MANY MORE DOORS THAN YOU WILL HAVE CLOSED

YOU'RE IN A GREAT POSITION STUDYING WHAT YOU HAPPEN TO BE PASSIONATE ABOUT WILL SET YOU UP IN A GREAT WAY FOR THE FUTURE SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN STUDYING WHAT THEY LOVE IN COLLEGE AND SETTING THEMSELVES UP WELL FOR THE FUTURE YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE THAT DECISION IF YOU DON'T STUDY PHYSICS YOU'LL WONDER WHAT YOU MISSED AND IF YOU DO STUDY PHYSICS YOU AREN'T REALLY LIMITING YOUR FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES
THE ADVICE I SEE AROUND A LOT IS THIS

PHYSICS IS A POOR CAREER CHOICE IT'S NOT MADE FOR ANYONE AND MANY CHANGE MAJORS AFTER A FEW SEMESTERS IT'S DIFFICULT LONG AND REQUIRES A LOT OF DEDICATION YOU'LL BE STUDYING AND READING WEEKDAYS AND WEEKENDS MONEY ISN'T EXCELLENT EITHER
BUT IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I TELL YOU IF YOU REALLY WANT TO STUDY PHYSICS
FOR MONEY NO ABSOLUTELY NOT

THIS ASSUMES THAT BY GOING INTO YOU MEAN GETTING A CAREER IN BUT YOU CAN MAJOR IN PHYSICS IN COLLEGE AND HAVE MANY MANY DIFFERENT OPTIONS OPEN TO YOU WHEN YOU FINISH YOU CAN EVEN GET A PHD IN PHYSICS AND STILL HAVE MANY DIFFERENT OPTIONS AFTER FINISHING THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE NOW WHETHER GOING INTO PHYSICS IS WORTH IT IN THE LONG RUN AND YOU SHOULDN'T YOU DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION AND EXPERIENCE NOW TO MAKE THAT DECISION
I WOULD QUESTION THAT NUMBER IF YOU DO IT RIGHT YOU CAN WALK OUT OF A BS IN PHYSICS AND MAKE TONS OF MONEY MY FRIEND MATH CS TOLD ME OF A COWORKER WITH A BS IN MATH WHO WITH 2 YEARS EXPERIENCE GOT AN OFFER FOR STOCKS SALARY FOR DATA SCIENCE AND IMO PHYSICS PREPARES YOU BETTER FOR DATA SCIENCE WHEN YOU START LOOKING INTO THE HEFTY RESEARCH DONE IN ALMOST ANY FIELD YOU WILL FIND PHYSICISTS CONTRIBUTING HEAVILY BIOLOGY COMPUTER SCIENCE ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING ECONOMICS MACHINE LEARNING ETC
IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION I'M CURRENTLY AN UNDERGRAD AND I LOVE THE PROSPECT OF BECOMING A PHYSICIST BUT HOW MY PLAN DIFFERS IS THAT I AM SHOOTING FOR A DOUBLE MAJOR BETWEEN PHYSICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE

IN MY MIND I AM PURSUING WHAT I LOVE IN PHYSICS WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY GIVING MYSELF A PRACTICAL FOUNDATION IN COMPUTER SCIENCE SOMETHING THAT I FIND MYSELF NATURALLY GOOD AT THAT I ENJOY DOING AND IS A HIGH DEMAND FIELD THAT PAYS WELL THAT WAY IF BECOMING A PHILOSOPHER DOESN'T TURN OUT WELL THEN I HAVE A FALLBACK OPTION THAT WILL PROVIDE FOR ME FAR BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE HELL BEST CASE SCENARIO IS THAT I CAN PURSUE A PHD IN PHYSICS AND DO RESEARCH INTO QUANTUM COMPUTING

SURE IT MAY BE ASKING A LOT FROM MYSELF ACADEMICALLY BUT I LOVE TO LEARN SO TAKING ON THE EXTRA WORK DOESN'T FAZE ME ONE BIT

HOPE THIS GIVES YOU SOME IDEAS
THREE THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW BEFORE YOU CHOOSE

YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE THEORETICAL VS EXPERIMENTAL UNTIL YOU GET INTO GRADUATE SCHOOL AND CHOOSE A DISSERTATION TOPIC

2 PHYSICS GRADUATE STUDENTS TYPICALLY DO NOT ACQUIRE ANY DEBT BECAUSE IT IS THE NORM FOR PHYSICS DEPARTMENTS TO OFFER WORK AS A TEACHING ASSISTANT OR RESEARCH ASSISTANT AND PHYSICS DOCTORATE PROGRAMS ARE NOT PRICED TO EXCLUDE LIKE LAW OR MEDICINE ARE

JOB OPPORTUNITIES ARE FAR MORE NUMEROUS AS AN EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICIST SINCE ITS IS FAR EASIER TO DO EXPERIMENTAL WORK WITH UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS THEORETICAL PHYSICISTS ARE COMPETING FOR POSITIONS AT LARGE TIER RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES OR ELITE RESEARCH CENTERS LIKE NIST OR PERIMETER INSTITUTE
WORTH IT TO MAKE AN AVERAGE OF IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS

I WOULDN'T PUT A WHOLE LOT OF STOCK INTO THAT NUMBER PERSONALLY PHYSICS IS AWESOME AND A TON OF FUN BUT THE JOBS ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THEORETICAL
NUMBER
IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHETHER YOU'LL STILL BE PASSIONATE OR DRIVEN TO STUDY THEORETICAL PHYSICS WHILE AT HIGH SCHOOL UNIVERSITY IS A VERY DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT AND THE PHYSICS IS UNLIKE ANYTHING YOU LEARN AT SCHOOL

A PHYSICS DEGREE IS A VALUABLE ACHIEVEMENT HOWEVER THE PAY IS ONLY GOOD SO LONG AS YOU DON'T GO INTO ACADEMIA INDUSTRY OR FINANCE ARE THE PLACES OF PECUNIARY DELIGHT

I'D SAY GET AN UNDERGRADUATE ON PHYSICS FIRST AND IF YOU ARE STILL PASSIONATE AND WILLING THEN GO FOR THE PHD IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS A LOT CHANGES WHILE AT UNIVERSITY WE CANNOT ALWAYS COMMIT TO THE ASPIRATIONS WE HAD AT SIXTH-FORM OR SCHOOL
THE USUAL EPISTEMOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD AND THE THEORIES IT PRODUCES IS IT WORKS AT LEAST WITHIN SOME REASONABLE SCOPE IN OTHER WORDS A THEORY IS GOOD IF IT CAN ACCURATELY PREDICT THE RESULTS OF FUTURE OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS

TO JUSTIFY THE STANDARD MODEL THEN YOU NEED TO SHOW THAT IT WORKS IN PRACTICE

THIS SHOULD NOT BE A CHALLENGING TASK CONSIDERING THE VAST NUMBER OF PREDICTIONS THAT THE STANDARD MODEL GETS RIGHT YOU'VE ALREADY IDENTIFIED ONE OF THEM IN ADDITION TO THE HIGGS BOSON YOU CAN ALSO TALK ABOUT THE W BOSON Z BOSON TOP QUARK AND CHARM QUARK THESE ARE ALL PARTICLES THAT THE STANDARD MODEL PREDICTED BEFORE THEY WERE ACTUALLY OBSERVED IN THE LAB AND WHEN THEY WERE EVENTUALLY OBSERVED THEIR PROPERTIES MATCHED THE STANDARD MODEL PREDICTIONS WELL AND THEN YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THE ESSENTIALLY ENDLESS LIST OF LIFETIMES DECAY RATES CROSS SECTIONS MASSES ETC THAT HAVE BEEN MEASURED IN PARTICLE ACCELERATORS AND SHOWN TO AGREE WITH THE STANDARD MODEL PREDICTION TO MANY MANY DECIMAL PLACES

BY DIGGING INTO THE HISTORY OF SOME OF THESE PREDICTIONS I THINK YOU COULD WRITE A FAIRLY CONVINCING PAPER ABOUT HOW GREAT THE SM IS EVEN WITHOUT GETTING INTO TECHNICAL DETAILS

ANOTHER MORE THEORETICAL APPROACH MIGHT BE THE WAY THAT THE SM AND PARTICLE PHYSICS MORE GENERALLY HAS BEEN ABLE TO USE A SINGLE SET OF BASIC TOOLS AND IDEAS EAST G FEYNMAN DIAGRAMS TO EXPLAIN PREVIOUSLY DISJOINT THEORIES IN THE SAME TERMS

BUT OF COURSE NO DISCUSSION OF THIS TOPIC WOULD BE COMPLETE WITHOUT MENTIONING THE LIMITATIONS OF THE SM AND THE TIMES THAT IT HAS PREDICTED THE WRONG RESULT HOWEVER EVERY SCIENTIFIC THEORY HAS A RANGE OF APPLICABILITY OUTSIDE OF WHICH IT BECOMES LESS ACCURATE

I COULDN'T COME UP WITH ANY REAL ARGUMENTS AS TO WHY WE SHOULD ALSO IN THE FUTURE KEEP USING THE STANDARD MODEL

EVEN IF THE SM GETS REPLACED BY A LARGER MORE COMPLETE THEORY IN THE FUTURE THE SM HAS ALREADY PROVED ITSELF TO BE SO ACCURATE WITHIN ITS RANGE OF APPLICABILITY THAT I THINK IT WILL ALWAYS BE A USEFUL LIMITING CASE WORTHY OF STUDY COMPARE WITH THE WAY WE STILL STUDY CLASSICAL MECHANICS AND USE IT FOR CERTAIN SITUATIONS EVEN THOUGH IT'S BEEN REPLACED BY QUANTUM MECHANICS SR

FINALLY JUST TO BE CLEAR YOU HAVEN'T YET STUDIED AFT AS A RIGHT I'M ASSUMING YOU'RE AN UNDERGRADUATE OR A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT OR SOMETHING SEE IF YOU CAN GET A COPY OF INTRODUCTION TO ELEMENTARY PARTICLES BY DAVID GRIFFITHS AND READ THE FIRST CHAPTER IN PAGES HE BASICALLY COVERS MUCH OF THE HISTORY OF PARTICLE PHYSICS AND THE SM AND ITS EXPERIMENTAL SUCCESSES GOING INTO SOMEWHAT MORE DETAIL THAN TYPICAL POPULAR SCIENCE SOURCES BUT OF COURSE LESS DETAIL THAN ACTUAL MATHEMATICAL TREATMENTS OF THE THEORY SO IT SHOULD STILL BE MOSTLY UNDERSTANDABLE


IF YOUR QUESTION IS WHY SHOULD WE CONTINUE TO USE THE STANDARD MODEL IN FUTURE

IF YOU ARE DOING WORK THAT IS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF WHAT THE STANDARD MODEL PREDICTS THEN YOU CAN KEEP USING IT BY ANALOGY LAWS OF MOTION ARE FINE TO CONTINUE USING TODAY EVEN THOUGH WE NOW KNOW IT HAS LIMITS PROVIDED THAT WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING FALLS WITHIN THOSE LIMITS EAST G IF YOU WERE DESIGNING A BRIDGE YOU COULD IGNORE RELATIVITY AND QUANTUM PHYSICS QUITE SAFELY

BUT THE WHOLE OBJECTIVE OF PHYSICS IS TO FIND BETTER AND BETTER MODELS OR IN OTHER WORDS WE'RE TRYING TO REPLACE THE SM WITH SOMETHING BETTER THERE ARE SOME PROPOSED CANDIDATES EAST G STRING THEORY QUANTUM FIELD THEORY BUT THERE ISN'T ENOUGH PHYSICAL EVIDENCE TO REPLACE THE STANDARD MODEL YET
PARTICLE PHYSICISTS DID LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF MEASUREMENTS HOW MANY OF THOSE CLEARLY DISAGREE WITH THE STANDARD MODEL



THE SM IS NOT PERFECT AND WE ALL KNOW THAT IT IS JUST AN APPROXIMATION BUT IT IS AN EXTREMELY GOOD APPROXIMATION IN ALL THE THOUSANDS OF TESTS DONE SO FAR

YOU ALWAYS HAVE SOME STATISTICAL FLUCTUATIONS OR SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES SO SMALL DEVIATIONS CAN BE A RESULT OF THOSE
MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF CLASSICAL MECHANICS HAS A COUPLE OF CHAPTERS ON THIS YOU SHOULD REALLY HAVE POSTED ON THE BOOK THREAD THOUGH
LECTURES ON SYMPLECTIC GEOMETRY BY ANA CANNAS DA SILVA
MCDUFF AND SALAMON FOR STRAIGHT UP SYMPLECTIC
LEE HAS A CHAPTER ON SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY HE HAS MANY EXAMPLES PROBLEMS THAT ARE WORDED IN TERMS OF CLASSICAL MECHANICS IN HIS PHENOMENAL TEXT INTRODUCTION TO SMOOTH MANIFOLDS I BELIEVE HIS SYMPLECTIC SECTION IS THE LAST CHAPTER BUT IF YOU'RE NEW TO DIFFERENTIAL TOPOLOGY THE WHOLE BOOK IS WORTH A READ

IF YOU'RE NOT SO INTO THE PURE MATHEMATICIAN'S TOPOLOGY YOU CAN SKIP THE FIRST CHAPTERS I BELIEVE THE FIRST AND GO STRAIGHT TO HIS SECTION ON TANGENT SPACES BUT IF YOU'RE REALLY INTO FOLLOWING ALL THE PROOFS YOU'LL HAVE TO FLIP BACK AND FORTH TO SOME EARLIER CHAPTERS A COUPLE OF TIMES I FIND TOPOLOGY BY ITSELF REALLY DRY AND BORING SO I STARTED WITH HIS SECTION ON TANGENT SPACES AND READ THE EARLIER SECTIONS WHEN THEY BECAME NECESSARY BY THE TIME I GOT TO THE END OF THE BOOK I WOUND UP READING EVERY CHAPTER SO THIS METHOD OF SKIPPING AND READING THE NECESSARY PRELIMINARY MATERIAL WON'T LEAD TO LESS LEARNING

BESIDES ONCE YOU LEARN DIFFERENTIAL TOPOLOGY YOUR WHOLE VIEW OF THE UNIVERSE WILL SEEM SO HOLISTIC I JUST FELT LIKE I UNDERSTOOD SO MANY THINGS CALCULUS LINEAR ALGEBRA EVERYDAY PHYSICAL EXPERIENCES PHENOMENA THAT DON'T SEEM DIRECTLY RELATED TO MATH ETC I COULD GO ON FOREVER OOOO MUCH BETTER ENJOY
ABRAHAM MARSDEN FOUNDATIONS OF MECHANICS
THIS MIGHT BE GOOD BECAUSE IT QUICKLY REVIEWS THE NECESSARY DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY THAT BEING SAID I FOUND THE LAST CHAPTER ON MOMENT MAPS PRETTY DENSE

FOR POLYMERS PLASTICS IT VARIES WITH THE MATERIAL COMPOSITION FROM THIS DAMME ARTICLE
I WOULD LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THE HELPFUL REPLIES I DID SOME RESEARCH MYSELF AND CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT TEMPERATURE CANNOT DIRECTLY INFLUENCE THE COEFFICIENT OF STATIC KINETIC FRICTION HOWEVER TEMPERATURE CAN AFFECT THE SURFACE OF CERTAIN SUBSTANCES SUCH AS RUBBER AND PLASTIC NOT ALL KINDS OF PLASTIC WHICH CAN THEREFORE HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COEFFICIENT OF FRICTION THAT'S AS MUCH AS MY BRAIN COULD TAKE
GREAT QUESTION I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO I COULD ONLY THINK OF CAR BRAKE PADS WHEN THEY GET HOT THEY ARE LESS EFFICIENT B C OF LESSENING FRICTION BETWEEN THE PADS AND THE DISK
IF FRICTION IS LARGELY THE MECHANICAL RESISTANCE TO DEFORMATION OF A MATERIAL EXPERIENCED BY A LARGE AREA OF SMALL INTERACTIONS THEN THE RAISING TEMPERATURE OF A MATERIAL WOULD LIKELY LOWER THE FRICTION COEFFICIENT DUE TO REDUCED ACTIVATION ENERGY FOR DEFORMATION OF THE STRUCTURE BUT I AM NOT A PHYSICIST I'VE JUST SEEN THIS POST ON MY FRONT PAGE FOR THE LAST HOURS THANKS TO THE CRAPPY FRONT PAGE ALGORITHM AND I DECIDED TO POST MY ANSWER IDEA
VERY INTERESTING

I THINK I WILL MAKE A PASSIVELY COOLED HEAT PIPE SYSTEM FOR MY NEXT PC BUILD AND HANG THE WHOLE THING ON THE WALL LIKE A TAPESTRY

WHAT'S THE BEST MEDIUM TO USE IN A HEAT PIPE
EYEBALLING THE PHASE DIAGRAM OF WATER LOOKING AT THE INTERSECT BETWEEN LIQUID AND GAS AT ROOM TEMPERATURE I'M THINKING THAT THE PRESSURE IN THE PIPE IS WPA OR SO WHEN AT ROOM TEMPERATURE AND HIGHER WHEN HEATED WOULD THAT BE CORRECT OR AM I THINKING OF IT THE WRONG WAY

NOT BAD BUT THERE ARE MORE INTUITIVE WAYS TO DO IT
NAMELY INTEGRATING DEFINITIONS OF DISPLACEMENT

BUT FOR V V AT JUST SUBTRACT V AND DIVIDE BY T YIELDING DV T A I DON'T THINK IT CAN GET ANY SIMPLER THAN THAT

FOR X X AT 2 JUST TAKE THE INTEGRAL OF DX DT V AT WHERE A IS CONSTANT

OR YOU CAN JUST MULTIPLY YOUR INITIAL V EQUATION THROUGH TIME SINCE THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT INTEGRATION HERE IS EXCEPT YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHY THE FACTOR POPS UP POWER RULE AND WHAT TO MAKE OF THE CONSTANTS OF INTEGRATION

THE TIME INDEPENDENT FORMULA IS A BIT TRICKIER THO AND I HAVEN'T RUN ACROSS A RUELY INTUITIVE DERIVATION
EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS
OBVIOUSLY YOU WILL WANT TO FOCUS ON EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH IN MY EXPERIENCE THE MOST HANDS ON FIELDS WERE CONDENSED MATTER AND AMO THERE ARE ALSO PROBABLY A FEW ASTRONOMY PROGRAMS THAT GET REALLY HANDS ON WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING TELESCOPES BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO LOOK INTO THAT

ALTERNATIVELY MANY GRADUATE ENGINEERING PROGRAMS WILL HAVE WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SPECIFICALLY ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
ASIDE FROM EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS LOOK AT INSTRUMENTATION PROGRAMS ACCELERATOR PHYSICS OPTICS MATERIALS SCIENCE CONDENSED MATTER AND EE PROGRAMS YOUR BACKGROUND WOULD LEND ITSELF TO ANY OF THESE FIELDS OF STUDY
CONDENSED MATTER SPECTROSCOPY AND APPLICATIONS LOTS AND LOTS OF HOURS IN THE OF THE ENVELOPE TINKERING AND LUCK
I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND EXPERIMENTAL MATERIALS SCIENCE I WORKED IN A MS LAB DURING MY UNDERGRAD AND AT LEAST OF THE TIME I WAS DOING SOMETHING HANDS ON MAY SOUND LOW BUT MOST OF THE EEG CHEMISTRY GUYS WERE MORE AROUND GRANTED THAT COULD BE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ELSEWHERE
ONE INTERESTING THING ABOUT GRAD SCHOOL IN THE HARD SCIENCES AND OR ENGINEERING IS THAT YOU CAN END UP DOING EITHER EXPERIMENTAL OR THEORETICAL STUFF REGARDLESS OF THE DEGREE PROGRAM

FOR EXAMPLE I'M IN A PHD PROGRAM IN ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND MOST OF MY WORK CONSISTS OF WRITING COMPUTER SIMULATIONS OF QUANTUM SYSTEMS I HAVE A FRIEND IN THE PHYSICS PROGRAM ON THE OTHER HAND WHO SPENDS HIS DAYS MAKING TRANSISTORS BY HAND WITH SCOTCH TAPE AND MEASURING THEM WITH LASERS

WHAT YOU END UP DOING IN GRAD SCHOOL DEPENDS ALMOST ENTIRELY ON YOUR RESEARCH ADVISOR AND NOT QUITE SO MUCH ON THE PARTICULAR MAJOR OR DEGREE PROGRAM YOUR BEST BET IS TO GET AN IDEA OF WHAT KIND OF STUFF YOU WANT TO WORK WITH AND THEN LOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING RESEARCH INVOLVING THAT STUFF REGARDLESS OF WHICH ACADEMIC DEPARTMENT THEY HAPPEN TO BE A PART OF
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL
HOW CAN YOU TELL THIS IS AN ADIABATIC COMPRESSION
WHAT IS THE FLASH WHEN THE GEL COLLAPSES SOMEONE IN ANOTHER THREAD SUGGESTED SONOLUMINECENSE BUT I DOUBT THAT IS IT JUST IGNITION BY ADIABATIC COMPRESSION IF SO WHAT IGNITES

IN ENGLAND PICK ANY SCHOOL YOU WANT
IN GERMANY ANY SCHOOL YOU LIKE
IN AUSTRALIA PRETTY MUCH ANYWHERE YOU WANT
SAME HERE IN TEXAS
LARGE DEMAND IN CANADA

PRETTY MUCH A LARGE DEMAND FOR ANY KIND OF SCIENCE OR MATH TEACHERS WHO HAVE ACTUAL DEGREES
OHIO IS HIRING FOR PHYSICS TEACHERS AS WELL
ALMOST ANYWHERE IN THE US PICK ANY SCHOOL YOU WANT GREAT JOB SECURITY TOO SINCE FIRING YOU MEANS TRYING TO REPLACE YOU MEANS YOU CAN CUT THROUGH A LOT OF BUREAUCRATIC BS AND NOT WORRY TOO MUCH I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND SLACKING OFF

I WAS DOING MY PHD IN PHYSICS WHEN I DECIDED TO TEACH HIGH SCHOOL INSTEAD AND GOT A JOB AT ONE OF THE BEST SCHOOLS IN THE STATE RIGHT AWAY I GOT LUCKY BUT IF YOU'RE A DECENT PHYSICS TEACHER YOU CAN FIND A JOB AT A GOOD SCHOOL WITHIN A FEW YEARS FOR SURE

ONE OF THE PHYSICS TEACHERS AT MY SCHOOL WENT ON MATERNITY LEAVE LAST YEAR AND THE SCHOOL ENDED UP GIVING HER CLASSES TO ONE OF THE CHEMISTRY TEACHERS WHO KNEW ENOUGH TO ALSO TEACH PHYSICS AND HIRED A CHEMISTRY LEAVE REPLACEMENT TO TAKE OVER THE CHEM TEACHER'S CLASSES BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T FIND A SINGLE PERSON FOR PHYSICS
IN UAE ANY SCHOOL YOU'D LIKE
IN FRANCE THERE'S A DEMAND VERY LARGE IN SOME ACADEMIES LIKE CRÉTEIL BUT THE WORK IS VERY DIFFICULT
I'M A STUDENT IN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT MY SCHOOL IS ONE OF THE BEST IN THE STATE AND WE ONLY HAVE TWO TEACHERS THAT ARE CERTIFIED TO TEACH PHYSICS ONE OF THE TEACHERS RETIRED LAST YEAR AND THAT CAUSED A BIG PROBLEM

NOT SURE WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THE JOB MARKET BUT THAT'S JUST A PERSONAL ANECDOTE
I'M NOT A PARTICULARLY SPECTACULAR TEACHER AND THE PAY HERE ON BRAZIL IS NOT EXACTLY AWESOME BUT I ALWAYS FIND MULTIPLE PLACES TO TEACH
I'M SURE IT VARIES A LOT DEPENDING ON THE EXACT JOB AND YOU HAVE SOME FREEDOM TO SET YOUR OWN BALANCE IN A LOT OF PLACES BUT A FAIRLY GENERAL RULE FOR RESEARCH JOBS IS THAT NOBODY IS GOING TO YOU FROM WORKING MORE AND LIVING LESS

AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO BASICALLY WORK ALL THE TIME THEY TEND TO PUBLISH A LOT OF PAPERS WHICH MAKES THEM ATTRACTIVE AS RESEARCHERS
DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU WANT TO DO

IF YOU WANT THE GLORY YOU NEED TO BE HUNGRY IF YOU'RE NOT WORKING HARD AND CONSTANTLY THINKING SOMEONE ELSE IS

IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU WANT WORK IN IS WHAT YOU GET OUT
IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT BEING OVERWORKED IN GRAD SCHOOL WHICH IS NOT UNCOMMON FEEL FREE TO MAKE THAT ONE OF YOUR PRIORITIES IN CHOOSING AN ADVISOR PLENTY OF ADVISORS ARE KEEN ON MAKING SURE THEIR GRAD STUDENTS WORK HARD BUT THEY ALSO DON'T WANT THEM TO BURN OUT YOU HAVE MORE POWER TO BARGAIN THAN YOU THINK AND IF A PROSPECTIVE ADVISOR ISN'T GIVING YOU ANY THEN THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT A GREAT CHOICE FOR YOU

OF COURSE DON'T EXPECT TO BE AS PROLIFIC AS THE TOP PEOPLE IN THE FIELD BUT THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY THE ONES COMFORTABLE IN MAKING THAT TRADEOFF A GOOD LAB PUTS PEOPLE FIRST AND RESEARCH SECOND IMO

YOU WILL HAVE A LOT OF LATITUDE TO DICTATE WHAT STYLE OF PRODUCTIVE WORK IS BEST FOR YOU IN YOUR CAREER
WHAT BALLANCE
THE HIGGS BOSON COULD NOT HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED EXPERIMENTALLY BY ACCIDENT

ATLAS AND CMS WOULD HAVE FOUND THE HIGGS BY NOW WITHOUT DEDICATED THE HIGGS PEAK CLEARLY APPEARS IN THE DIPHOTON AND LEPTON SPECTRUM EVEN WITHOUT OPTIMIZED CUTS OTHER DECAY CHANNELS AND THE LESS FREQUENT PRODUCTION MODES WOULD BE HARDER TO FIND

ONE COULD ARGUE THAT THE LOC AND ITS EXPERIMENTS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN BUILT OR BUILT DIFFERENTLY WITHOUT THE HIGGS PREDICTIONS BUT THAT QUICKLY ENDS UP IN CHAOS THEORY INSTEAD OF PARTICLE PHYSICS

EDIT TO EXTEND THAT A BIT THE AUTHOR POINTS OUT THAT A LOT OF THEORETICAL RESEARCH WAS CITED BY THE COLLABORATIONS THAT IS TRUE BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THE DISCOVERY WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT THE PREDICTION OF A HIGGS BOSON IT JUST MEANS THE EXPERIMENTS COULD NOT HAVE COMPARED THE MEASUREMENT TO THOSE PREDICTIONS MODELING THE BACKGROUND IN THEORY IS NICE BUT A IT IS INDEPENDENT OF THE HIGGS AND B IT IS NOT REQUIRED THE HIGGS TO PHOTON MEASUREMENTS JUST USE A SMOOTH FUNCTION TO FIT THE BACKGROUND WITHOUT FURTHER THEORY INPUT THE HIGGS TO LEPTON MEASUREMENT HAS A CLEAR PEAK YOU CAN EITHER SUBTRACT THE EXPECTED NUMBER OF EVENTS OR USE A FIT HERE AS WELL DOESN'T MATTER MUCH THE MAIN UNCERTAINTY IS STATISTICAL AS THE TOTAL EVENT YIELD IS SMALL
PLEASE CHANGE YOUR LINK TO POINT TO THE ABSTRACT NOT THE PDF THANKS
THIS IS AWESOME BRINGING UP THE NEXT GROUP OF KIDS WITH A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONCEPT MAKES IT WAY EASIER FOR THEM TO GRASP LATER ON

THERE WAS AN ARTICLE GOING AROUND A FEW MONTHS AGO ABOUT A DEBATE BETWEEN EINSTEIN AND A PHILOSOPHER NAMED BERGSON ABOUT THE NATURE OF TIME AFTER IT OCCURRED IT WAS GENERALLY THOUGHT THAT BERGSON HAD WON BERGSON WAS ONE OF THE LEADING PHILOSOPHICAL THINKERS OF THE TIME ALTHOUGH CLEARLY HISTORY HAS REMEMBERED EINSTEIN MORE


I HEAVILY SUGGEST THAT YOU POST A SIMILAR QUESTION OVER ON R PHILOSOPHY AS THEY'RE SURE TO HAVE A BETTER KNOWLEDGE OF THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY AS FAR AS MODERN MATHEMATICS AND PHILOSOPHY ARE CONCERNED HOWEVER IT'S INTERESTING TO NOTE JUST HOW INTERTWINED THEY WERE ESPECIALLY IN THE EARLY TAKE A LOOK AT THIS ARTICLE FOR MORE INFORMATION THAT'S PROBABLY MY SINGLE FAVORITE PIECE OF SCIENTIFIC MATHEMATICAL PHILOSOPHICAL EXPOSITION IT TIES EVERYTHING NEATLY INTO A FEW PAGES WHILE MANAGING TO KEEP IT ACCESSIBLE TO LAYPEOPLE
INTERESTING QUESTION BECAUSE PHILOSOPHERS ARE HISTORICALLY TIED TO POWER STRUCTURES THAT HAVE EVERY INCENTIVE TO STIFLE SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE YOU'LL FIND THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT ADVANCES IN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY ARE ALSO TIED TO A BREAKING AWAY OF OLD POWER STRUCTURES OF CHURCH AND OR MONARCHY THE RENAISSANCE THE FRENCH REVOLUTION THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION AND THE WAR CYNICISM EXISTENTIALISM ALL OF THESE WERE PARADIGM SHIFTS IN INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM AS WELL AS WORLD-VIEW SO LITERATURE FROM THESE TIMES WILL TELL YOU A LOT ABOUT LIVING THROUGH A TIME OF PHILOSOPHICAL UPHEAVAL

SPECIFIC EXAMPLES SOCRATES DEMOCRITUS RENAISSANCE ARCHITECTURE ART NIETZSCHE DOSTOEVSKY KARL MARX THE DADAIST MOVEMENT I COULD GO ON AND ON

WHAT TEXTBOOKS WOULD EVERYONE RECOMMEND ON STATISTICAL MECHANICS ESPECIALLY BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY ON THE LINK BETWEEN STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND QUANTUM FIELD THEORY

WRITING A SUMMER ESSAY FOR UNI ON THE INFORMATION PARADOX IF ANYONE CAN RECOMMEND ANY GOOD RESOURCES ON THAT AT AN UNDERGRADUATE LEVEL UK UNIVERSITY GOING INTO MY 3RD YEAR I'D BE REALLY GRATEFUL
SUPPOSE I HAVE READ BOTH THE HALLIDAY RESNICK INTRO PHYSICS BOOK AND THE SEARS ET AL BOOK UNIVERSITY PHYSICS WHAT NEXT

IT MAY HELP TO KNOW THAT I HAVE A BA IN MATH AND CAN READ PRETTY MUCH ANY INTRO GRADUATE LEVEL MATH TEXTBOOK BUT I OFTEN FIND THAT WHEN PHYSICISTS USE ANY MATH ABOVE CALCULUS IN A TEXTBOOK IT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME
I'M LOOKING FOR TEXTBOOKS WITH INFORMATION ABOUT PROPERTIES AND THEIR THEORETICAL EXPLANATIONS IF SOMEONE CAN RECOMMEND ANY I'LL BE GRATEFUL
CURRENTLY READING VIBRATIONS AND WAVES MIT INTRO BY FRENCH FOR ONE OF MY COURSES IS THERE A GOOD COMPLEMENTARY BOOK TO THIS ONE
I JUST GRADUATED WITH A BS IN PHYSICS AND WHILE GARD SCHOOL IS NOT CURRENTLY IN MY PLAN I'D STILL LIKE TO FURTHER MY KNOWLEDGE SO ANY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GRADUATE LEVEL TEXTS THAT ARE GOOD FOR SELF STUDY
GRADUATED WITH BIOPHYSICS DEGREE I WANT O STUDY QUANTUM FIELD THEORY ON MY OWN THO WHAT ARE THE BEST TEXT BOOKS

I POSTED THIS IN THE PREVIOUS THREAD BUT POSSIBLY TOO LATE AS I NEVER GOT ANY RESPONSES HERE IT IS AGAIN

I WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE DIRAC FIELD BETTER THAN I DO PESKIN AND SCHRODER AND NOTES DID AN ALRIGHT JOB OF GETTING ME TO TURN THE CRANK BUT I REALLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO ROK IT DOES ANYONE KNOW OF A GOOD TEXT THAT INTRODUCES THE DIRAC FIELD AND SPINORS ALONGSIDE THE REQUISITE REPRESENTATION THEORY AND GEOMETRY TO REALLY UNDERSTAND IT

I'VE HAD SOME DIFFERENTIAL TOPOLOGY SO I'M COMFORTABLE WITH LIE GROUP AND LIE ALGEBRAS BUNDLES AND THE LIKE I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE THAN PESKIN AND SCHROEDER FOR INSTANCE
ANY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SELF LEARNING GENERAL RELATIVITY COSMOLOGY AND OR QUANTUM MECHANICS
ANYBODY KNOW OF A GOOD REFERENCE FOR THEORY
I'M A LITTLE LATE TO THE PARTY BUT IT IS WORTH A TRY IS THERE A MORE UP TO DATE TEXT ON PHYSICAL COSMOLOGY

IN PARTICULAR THE TOPICS COVERED IN PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL COSMOLOGY AND PEACOCKS COSMOLOGICAL PHYSICS
FREE PHYSICS TEXT BOOK HETP
ANYTHING THAT DESCRIBES SUPERFLUID OR SUPERCONDUCTORS IN TERMS OF DIFFERENTIAL TOPOLOGY FORMS MANIFOLDS ETC WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED EVEN PAPERS OR ARTICLES WOULD BE USEFUL THANKS

DOES THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE ARISE BECAUSE THESE BASIS DO NO OVERLAP AND WHEN BASIS DO OVERLAP WHAT CONSEQUENCES DOES THIS HAVE

THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE EXISTS BECAUSE THOSE TWO OBSERVABLES ARE INCOMPATIBLE THE POSITION AND MOMENTUM OPERATORS DO NOT COMMUTE THEY OBEY X P I H

THIS MEANS THAT THEY'RE NOT SIMULTANEOUSLY DIAGONALIZABLE

THEY DO NOT SHARE A BASIS OF EIGENSTATE

IF ONE IS WELL-DEFINED THE OTHER IS NOT

ALL OF THE ABOVE STATEMENTS ARE EQUIVALENT TO EACH OTHER

YOU CAN DERIVE A GENERALIZED UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE FOR TWO ARBITRARY OPERATORS AND THE MINIMUM OF THE PRODUCT OF THE VARIANCES IN THE TWO OBSERVABLES DEPENDS ON THE EXPECTATION VALUE OF THEIR COMMUTATOR IF THEY COMMUTE THE MINIMUM UNCERTAINTY IS ZERO
DOES THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE ARISE BECAUSE THESE BASIS DO NO OVERLAP

NO THEY DO OVERLAP THE OVERLAP IS GIVEN UP TO A NORMALIZATION BY E IP X I'M SURE THIS IS AN EXPRESSION YOU'VE SEEN BEFORE

THE UNCERTAINTY ARISES BECAUSE THE OPERATORS X AND P DO NOT COMMUTE AND THUS IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO CONSTRUCT A BASIS IN WHICH THESE OPERATORS ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY DIAGONAL THE POSITION BASIS IS NOTHING MORE THAN A BASIS IN WHICH THE POSITION OPERATOR IS DIAGONAL THIS MAY SOUND OBVIOUS BUT IT'S GOOD TO HAVE IT SAID EXPLICITLY IN THESE SITUATIONS WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT IF YOU'RE IN A POSITION EIGENSTATE I EAST A STATE VECTOR WHICH IS ONE OF THE BASIS OF THE DIAGONAL REPRESENTATION OF THE POSITION OPERATOR YOU KNOW YOU CANNOT BE IN AN EIGENSTATE OF MOMENTUM AS WELL YOU MUST BE IN A SUPERPOSITION
ROUGHLY SPEAKING PARTICLES IN SOLUTION JUST MOVE RANDOMLY IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER THEY BUMP INTO SOLVENT OR SOLUTE

WHEN YOU HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF PARTICLES THEN ALL THEIR RANDOM MOVEMENTS PUT TOGETHER WILL WORK OUT TO MOVEMENT FROM REGIONS OF HIGH CONCENTRATION TO REGIONS OF LOW CONCENTRATION ON AVERAGE

SUPPOSING YOU HAVE TWO SOLUTES CALL THEM A AND B YOU SHOULD GET THE SAME PREDICTED DIFFUSION IF YOU PRETEND THAT A AND B ARE THE SAME AS YOU GET IF YOU WORK OUT THE DIFFUSION FOR A AND THEN THE DIFFUSION FOR B AND ADD THEM TOGETHER

YOU SEEM TO BE DESCRIBING A SITUATION WHERE THE PRESSURE VARIES BETWEEN REGIONS FOR INSTANCE AN IDEAL GAS WHERE CONCENTRATION N V AND PRESSURE P ARE DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL IN THAT CASE YEAH FOR SURE THEN THERE'S GOING TO BE AN OVERALL FLOW OF PARTICLES FROM HIGH PRESSURE TO LOW PRESSURE BECAUSE ALL THE PARTICLES IN THE HIGH PRESSURE REGION ARE BUMPING EACH OTHER OUT THIS WILL BE IN ADDITION TO THE DIFFUSION EFFECT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND MIGHT EVEN OVERWHELM THAT EFFECT ALTOGETHER

BUT THE SITUATION WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE IS A DIFFERENT ONE TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE ARE IN EQUILIBRIUM FOR EVERY ML OF FLUID THAT ENTERS A REGION ANOTHER ML LEAVES IF A PARTICULAR REGION IS UNUSUALLY HIGH IN OXYGEN AND LOW IN THEN THE FLUID LEAVING THAT REGION WILL TEND TO BE HIGH IN OXYGEN AND LOW IN AND THE FLUID REPLACING IT WILL TEND TO BE LOWER IN OXYGEN AND HIGHER IN THEREFORE IN GENERAL OXYGEN IS DIFFUSING OUT OF THAT REGION AND IS FLOWING IN
LET'S SUPPOSE I HAVE A BOX WITH N RED PARTICLES ON THE RIGHT AND N BLUE PARTICLES ON THE LEFT OVERALL THE BOX HAS A CONSTANT CONCENTRATION EVERYWHERE IF THE PARTICLES FOLLOWED WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THE RED PARTICLES WOULD NEVER MOVE TO THE LEFT AND THE BLUE ONES WOULD NEVER MOVE TO THE RIGHT THAT IS THEY WOULD NEVER MIX THIS ABSURD A BUNCH OF PARTICLES MOVING RANDOMLY HAVE TO MIX EVENTUALLY

WAIT SO THEY'RE PISSING AND MOANING ABOUT CONVERTING FROM UNITS IN TO UNITS IN I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THE SI OVER IMPERIAL ARGUMENTS BUT THIS IS ESSENTIALLY SAYING IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO BE IN A SYSTEM WHERE CONVERSION IS IN POWERS OF I NEED EVERYONE IN THE SAME POWERS OF EVEN IF THAT RESULTS IN UNWIELDY DERIVED UNITS THE ARTICLE EVEN COMPLAINS ABOUT HAVING TO DEAL WITH MICROSIEVERTS AND MILLISIEVERTS IF YOU ARE DEALING WITH A SIEVERT YOU MIGHT WANT TO RETHINK LIFE CHOICES
YOU CAN'T USE THE RULE WITH THE SI UNITS I DON'T SEE HOW THEY ARE SUPERIOR IN ANY WAY THE BECQUEREL IS KIND OF LIKE THROWING OUT THE INTUITIVE GRAM AND USING AMUS FOR ALL CALCULATIONS SURE YOU COULD DO IT BUT WHY
THIS IS SUCH STUPID RATIONALE

SIEVERT TO REM YOU LITERALLY HAVE TO MULTIPLY OR DIVIDE BY ONE HUNDRED IT'S SO FUCKING EASY

2 THE FACT THAT THE GRAY IS A JOULE KILOGRAM IS SO NOT IMPORTANT EVERY DAY HEALTH PHYSICS THE FACT THAT YOU WOULD NEED TO TALK ABOUT DOSES IN MICROSIEVERTS AND MILISIEVERTS WHEN WE ARE ALREADY USED TO USING MILLIREM AND REM WOULD BE SUCH A PAIN IN THE ASS

BECQUEREL ARE STUPID AND CUMBERSOME WITH CURIES YOU GET SOME PERSPECTIVE JUST BY WAY OF THE PREFIXES MICROCURIE A LITTLE YOU'RE FINE AROUND IT MILLICURIE IT'S GETTING WARM CURIE A LOT

WE ALREADY ARE FORCED TO USE B WHEN TRANSPORTING PACKAGES ANYWAYS SO THAT DOESN'T CHANGE SHIT

REM PER YEAR IS WAY LESS CUMBERSOME THAN MILISIEVERTS PER YEAR

I HAVE JOKED MANY A TIME THAT I BELIEVE IN A MISANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE THAT STRING CONSTRUCTIONS ARE TOO OFTEN INTEGRABLE AND NATURE IS WHY WE CAN'T HAVE GOOD THINGS
FIRST SENTENCE

STRING THEORY HAS SO FAR FAILED TO LIVE UP TO ITS PROMISE AS A WAY TO UNITE GRAVITY AND QUANTUM MECHANICS

COMPLETELY WRONG MAYBE THEY MEANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT BUT THIS IS SIMPLY THE OPPOSITE OF THE TRUTH

STRINGS SUCCEED IN THIS UNIFICATION WHILE EVERYTHING ELSE HAS FAILED

KIND OF RUINED THE WHOLE ARTICLE
JUST MAYBE STRING THEORY MAY SHOW UP SOMETHING WE MISSED IN AN UNRELATED FIELD SUCH AS AI IE SIMULATING AN DIMENSIONAL NEURAL NET ON A D T LATTICE
FROM THE WORKSHOP ABSTRACTS THIS LOOKS TO BE A VERY INTERESTING PROGRAM WITH MANY PROMINENT RESEARCHERS IN THE FIELD GIVING TALKS I WAS INTERESTED TO SEE THAT SABINE HOSSENFELDER IN HER BLOG POST SAID THE TALKS WILL BOTH BE RECORDED AND LIVESTREAMED THIS WILL BE THE 5TH IN A SERIES OF WORKSHOPS ON THIS TOPIC

ONCE I SAW THIS I WAS INTERESTED TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY ONLINE MATERIALS FROM PREVIOUS WORKSHOPS IN THIS SERIES SO FAR I FOUND TALK SLIDES FROM THE WORKSHOP VIDEO AND SLIDES FROM THE WORKSHOP THIS PAPER FROM THE WORKSHOP AND VIDEO AND SLIDES FROM THE WORKSHOP

WHILE I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON BABISM I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT DOES NOT SAY THAT YOUR PERSONAL BELIEFS ALTER THE OUTCOME OF EXPERIMENTS RATHER IT'S SAYING THAT QM SHOULD BE VIEWED AS A WAY TO DESCRIBE YOUR SUBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE SYSTEM NOT TOO DIFFERENT FROM THE COPENHAGEN INTERPRETATION

PEOPLE DIDN'T JUST FLOAT AROUND UNTIL NEWTON DISCOVERED GRAVITY SIMILARLY KNOWING OR NOT OF QM DOESN'T CHANGE THE OUTCOME OF EXPERIMENTS

I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A FULL WAVE SIMULATOR BUT I KNOW THERE'S A HELL OF A LOT MORE CODING THERE
REALLY COOL APPLICATION AND WELL DONE

MAYBE I MISSED IT BUT IT WOULD BE NICE THE PRESENCE OF AN OPTION THAT ALLOW THE USER TO DEFINE THE COORDINATES OF THE OBJECTS EXACTLY

HOWEVER CONGRATULATION
AWESOME I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO WRITE A TOOL LIKE THIS BUT NEVER HAD THE TIME I WOULD LOVE IT IF YOU COULD INCLUDE COLORED LIGHT SOURCES AND DISPERSION
I'M CURIOUS ABOUT EVERYTHING I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT THIS PLACE IS AND HOW IT WORKS ALL OF IT WHENEVER I ASKED THOSE QUESTIONS AND FOLLOWED THE CHAIN TO THE END I GOT TO PHYSICS MATH AND PHILOSOPHY OUT OF THOSE THREE I PICKED THE FIELD WITH THE HIGHEST PROBABILITY OF AN ACCIDENT GRANTING ME SUPER POWERS
I DON'T

DISCLAIMER CURRENTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF PROBLEM SETS
YOU KNOW THAT HIGH YOU GET OFF OF SOLVING HARD PROBLEMS YOU GET THAT PRETTY OFTEN FOR PHYSICS IN THE BEGINNING THEN YOU SLOWLY NEED BIGGER AND BIGGER LIKE SUBMITTING A PAPER OR PRESENTING A TALK ON YOUR RESEARCH

WE'RE JUST ADDICTS
BECAUSE IT EXPLAINS THE WHY OF SO MANY QUESTIONS
IT'S THE BEST TOOL WE HAVE FOR ATTEMPTING TO UNDERSTAND THE UNIVERSE AND OURSELVES
IT'S MORE THAT I LOVE RADIATION
PHYSICS IS LIKE A SHOP THAT SELLS THE HARDEST AND MOST CHALLENGING PUZZLES AND CERTAINLY THE MOST FUN
BECAUSE IT'S COOL
PHYSICS EXPLAINS US WHY MATTER LOOK TO US IN THIS WAY HAVE A VERY WIDE RANGE FROM SUB ATOMIC PARTICLES TO THE WHOLE UNIVERSE WE CAN GET ANSWERS WHY THESE THINGS COME TO US WITH THESE PHYSICAL FEATURES
I REALLY LIKE NATURE IN GENERAL NOT JUST THE LIVING SIDE OF IT LIKE MOST PEOPLE AND PHYSICS IS REALLY A GOOD THING TO DO IF YOU APPRECIATE THOSE THINGS MATH AND CONCEPTS THAT ALLOW YOU TO MAKE PREDICTIONS OR MAGIC I'M EASILY DISTURBED BY THINGS I DON'T UNDERSTAND SPECIALLY THINGS IN NATURE I DON'T CARE THAT MUCH ABOUT HUMAN NATURE QUESTIONS BUT PHYSICS MATH BIOLOGY CHEMISTRY BOTHER ME REALLY EASILY

BECAUSE IT'S THE ONE THING THAT CAN CONSTANTLY FEED MY CURIOSITY FOR HOW THE WORLD WORKS THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS LEFT TO BE RATIONALIZED AND DISCOVERED AND IT JUST MADE ME SO HAPPY BEING ABLE TO DEBATE QUANTUM PHYSICS WITH MY SOPHOMORE PHYSICS TEACHER TO SIMPLY UNDERSTAND MORE OF HOW IT ALL FITS IN
THE WORLD IS A MASTER CONSTANTLY BEING SOLVED AND MADE COMPLEX IT'S FASCINATING AND SOLVING PROBLEMS FEELS GOOD YOU ALSO HAVE COOL PRACTICAL USES

WHAT IS DE BROGLIE INTERFERENCE ALL WAVES CAN FORM INTERFERENCE PATTERNS WATER ACOUSTIC QUANTUM WHATEVER
THE DISPERSION RELATION FOR SOUND WAVES TOPICALLY I K IS PRETTY DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF DE BROGLIE WAVES I K 2 THEY DON'T ACT THE SAME BUT IF IT'S INTERFERENCE AS A GENERAL PHENOMENON YOU CARE ABOUT SURE
I THINK YOU'LL LIKE THIS

HOWEVER YOU CAN'T GET THE MORE INTERESTING ASPECTS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS LIKE ENTANGLEMENT FROM THIS
IS SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHAT YOU MEAN
I'M NOT SURE THAT DE BROGLIE INTERFERENCE IS SOMETHING THAT'S WORTH SIMULATING THE ASPECT OF IT DE BROGLIE WAVELENGTH THAT'S INTRIGUING IS THAT THINGS WHICH WE LIKE TO THINK OF AS PARTICLES HAVE PROPERTIES WE ASSOCIATE WITH WAVES WAVE INTERFERENCE REALLY ISN'T THAT EXCITING ONCE YOU ACCEPT THAT THINGS ARE WAVES
WHICH MEASURING RANGE DO YOU NEED MAYBE GALLIUM LIQUID SOLID TRANSITION IS GOOD
C IS NOT SAYING MUCH UNLESS YOU KNOW THE RANGE YOUR INTERESTED IN COVERING YOU CAN CORRECT FOR PRESSURE DEPENDENCE
ASSUMING YOU HAVE LINEAR RESPONSE USING DRY ICE OR LIQUID NITROGEN IS A GREAT WAY TO GET DATA POINTS WITH HIGH LEVER ARM FOR YOUR FIT
DO YOU HAVE AN ACCURATE METHOD OF WEIGHING STUFF OUT IF SO YOU COULD MEASURE OUT A KNOWN AMOUNT OF SALT AND ADD IT TO A KNOWN AMOUNT OF ICE WATER YOU CAN USE FREEZING POINT DEPRESSION TO DETERMINE WHAT THE TEMPERATURE IS
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF TEMPERATURE STANDARDS

PRODUCTS ITS

A CELL IS USED AS A PRACTICAL REALIZATION OF AN ABSOLUTE TEMPERATURE THE TRIPLE POINT IS AT ONE AND ONLY ONE TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE THE CELL IS DESIGNED TO HAVE BASICALLY PURE WATER AND NO AIR OR OTHER IMPURITIES AND THE THREE PHASES OF WATER VAPOR LIQUID WATER AND ICE OCCUR AT ONE POINT OF THE PHASE DIAGRAM

FOR THE OTHER POINTS IT DEPENDS VERY MUCH ON WHAT APPLICATION AND TEMPERATURE RANGE YOU HAVE METAL FREEZING POINTS CAN BE GOOD STANDARDS BUT FOR C OR SO YOU ARE BEST OFF JUST GETTING ANOTHER CALIBRATED THERMOMETER BEST IS TO USE THAT THERMOMETER AND A CONTROL SYSTEM TO KEEP A LARGE BATH AT A KNOWN FIXED TEMPERATURE THEN YOU PUT YOUR UNCALIBRATED THERMOMETER IN THAT BATH WAIT FOR IT TO EQUILIBRATE THEN YOU HAVE CALIBRATED IT
IS THIS A PRACTICAL PROBLEM BECAUSE IN THEORY YOU COULD KEEP VARYING THE PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE OF WATER UNTIL YOU ENCOUNTERED THE TRIPLE POINT WHICH OCCURS ONLY AT A SINGLE SPECIFIC PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE

YOU COULD ALSO GRAB A SAMPLE OF MAGNETIZED IRON AND HEAT IT IRON UNDERGOES A PHASE TRANSITION AND WILL STOP BEING FERROMAGNETIC AT A CERTAIN TEMPERATURE WHICH CIRC IT'S AN INTRINSIC PROPERTY OF THE MATERIAL AND SO DOESN'T DEPEND ON OTHER QUANTITIES LIKE PRESSURE
IT'S A PHYSICS LAB SO YOU GOTTA HAVE A HARMONIC OSCILLATOR OF SOME KIND MAKE IT DAMPED DRIVEN IF YOU WANT TO ADD SOME BEEF TO THE ANALYSIS IF YOU COUPLE TWO OF THESE OSCILLATORS TOGETHER YOU CAN GET CHAOTIC MOTION AND THERE IS A LOT OF NEAT ANALYSIS YOU CAN DO FOR THAT SEVERAL COLLEGE LEVEL UPPER LEVEL PHYSICS LABS HAVE THIS KIND OF CHAOS EXPERIMENT SO YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND SOME DETAILS WITH A BIT OF GOOGLING

ANOTHER IDEA WOULD BE TO HAVE THE STUDENTS BUILD UP THEIR OWN PID CONTROLLER FOR EXAMPLE YOU COULD HAVE THEM BUILD A HEATER WITH TEMPERATURE CONTROL PID CONTROL IS UBIQUITOUS IN EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS AND IN INDUSTRY SO IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE STUDENTS COULD REALLY LEARN HOW IT WORKS

ANYWAY BEST OF LUCK SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT CLASS
IF YOUR LAB IS ABOUT MEASUREMENT THEN IT SEEMS LIKE YOU OUGHT TO START WITH THE SENSORS AND WORK BACK TO THE EXPERIMENT

OPTICAL GATES ARE NICE BUT YOU REALLY OUGHT TO INCLUDE SOME OTHER STUFF LIKE THERMISTORS LAW OF COOLING RANGE FINDERS PENDULUM MOTION MICROPHONES FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF TUNING FORKS AND DIRECT ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENTS ARE LEDS AND SOLAR CELLS THE SAME THING
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO MEASURE THE SPEED OF LIGHT WITH A LONG ENOUGH FIBRE OPTIC CABLE AND AN ALDUINO ALTHOUGH YOU MIGHT NEED SOME MORE SPECIALIZED MEASUREMENT ELECTRONICS
A FUN LITTLE EXPANSION TO YOUR ELECTROMAGNET IDEA COULD BE TO USE AN ALDUINO AS A PID CONTROLLER TO MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE COIL USING A THERMISTOR AND CONTROL IT VIA PM

EDIT JUST READ THIS WAS ALREADY SUGGESTED MY APOLOGIES

THERE'S ALSO A TON OF OPTICS EXPERIMENTS YOU CAN DO USING MATALAN USING A SENSOR ON A STEPPER MOTOR TO READ INTENSITY OF DIFFRACTION PATTERNS AND CONDUCT ERROR ANALYSIS IS A PRETTY SIMPLE ONE
NOT SURE IF THIS IS IN LINE WITH YOUR STUDENTS PHYSICS LEVEL BUT I REMEMBER READING A RECENTLY PUBLISHED PAPER THAT PROPOSED A RELATIVELY SIMPLE EXPERIMENT THAT WOULD BASICALLY DEMONSTRATE A WAY OF MAKING PHOTONS BEHAVE LIKE FERMIONS I WAS AMAZED BECAUSE IT SEEMED LIKE A RELATIVELY SIMPLE SETUP PROCEDURE THAT HAD AWESOME RESULTS HERE IS THE PAPER

I THINK IT MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE FOR A SENIOR LEVEL LAB OR SO BUT I NEVER DID IT SO I'M NOT SURE
YOU COULD DO IT IN THE SAME WAY HERBAL SPACE PROGRAM DOES IT I GUESS JUST SIMPLIFIED TO 2D
INTRODUCE SPHERES OF INFLUENCES FOR THE BODIES AND WITHIN THESE SPHERES ASSUME THAT ONLY THE GRAVITY OF THAT ONE BODY AFFECTS THE SHIP THEN YOU HAVE 2 OPTIONS
YOU HAVE NOW ONLY ONE BODY TO CONSIDER SO A DYNAMIC SOLVER WOULD NOT BE TOO HARD USE VELOCITY OVERLET OR LEAPFROG FOR CALCULATING THE ORBIT
2 THE ORBIT OF YOUR SHIP AROUND SAID BODY CAN BE REPRESENTED BY CONIC SECTIONS

IS IT CONSIDERED SURPRISING IN THE COMMUNITY THAT FIGO NOW MANAGED PICKED UP A SIGNAL FROM MULTIPLE INSPIRALING BINARIES BUT NOT FROM ANY SUPERNOVAE AT LEAST FROM THIS PLOT IT SEEMS LIKE ALIGN WAS DESIGNED TO OPERATE IN A FREQUENCY SWEET SPOT WHERE BOTH TYPES OF EVENTS COULD BE SEEN NOW NAIVELY I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE COMMON FOR SUPERNOVAE TO OCCUR CLOSE ENOUGH TO US TO KICK OFF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES POWERFUL ENOUGH TO BE PICKED UP BY FIGO THAN BLACK HOLE MERGERS WHICH I WOULD HAVE GUESSED WERE PRETTY EXOTIC I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY INSIGHT FROM ANYONE MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE FIELD
MAY I ASK A QUESTION

GENERAL RELATIVITY STATES THAT GRAVITY ISN'T REALLY A FORCE BUT ACTUALLY THE CURVATURE OF SPACE-TIME DISTORTING AN OBJECT'S MOVEMENT TOWARD THE MASS PRODUCING THE SAID FORCE

FROM MY UNDERSTANDING OF PARTICLE PHYSICS EVERY FORCE HAS A MEDIATING PARTICLE IN THE CASE OF GRAVITY THIS IS THE GRAVITON

SO HOW DO THESE TWO THEORIES RECONCILE IF GRAVITY ISN'T REALLY A FORCE BUT RATHER JUST THE CURVATURE OF SPACE-TIME WHY DOES IT NEED A MEDIATING PARTICLE
NOT REALLY A QUESTION ON THE PHYSICS BUT ISN'T ANYONE ELSE PUT OFF BUT HOW BADLY A FEW PHYSICISTS KEPT THE SECRET BEFORE THE ANNOUNCEMENT KRAUSS FLAT OUT TWEETED IT MOTL ALLUDED TO IT I THINK IT WAS UNPROFESSIONAL AND DISHONEST AND COULD HAVE TURNED INTO ABSOLUTE HELL FOR FIGO IF THE DISCOVERY HADN'T PANNED OUT

PERHAPS WHAT HAPPENED WITH KRAUSS FOR EXAMPLE IS HE THOUGHT BEING TRUSTED WITH THE INFORMATION SOMEHOW MEANT HE WAS PART OF THE TEAM AND THAT LEAKING THAT INFORMATION WOULD HAVE CONSOLIDATED HIM FOR THE DIVULGER ROLE IN THAT TEAM LIKE THERE'S A MEDAL FOR BEING THE FIRST TO KNOW IN THE END HE'S JUST BEEN A HUGE DICK
ANY CHANCE THERE HAVE BEEN ANY DEVELOPMENTS WITH GWS AND THEIR RELATION TO THE MACHO THEORY OF DARK MATTER I REMEMBER READING THIS ABSTRACT BUT I HAVEN'T REALLY HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT IT OTHERWISE
I REMEMBER THE FIRST ONE MADE ME THINK WOW THE FIRST ONE WE DETECTED WAS THAT EARLY AFTER TURNING ON THE DETECTOR BLACK HOLE MERGERS MUST BE REALLY COMMON AND THEN AFTER THE SECOND ONE I THOUGHT THAT'S IT BLACK HOLE MERGERS MUST BE REALLY RARE
WHAT MAKES THESE BLACK HOLE BINARIES WHICH CAN MERGE IN THE LIFETIME OF THE UNIVERSE

DO WE KNOW THE ROUGH AGE OF THESE BLACK HOLES IF THEY ARE VERY ANCIENT THEN MAYBE THERE IS LESS MYSTERY AS THE EARLIER UNIVERSE WAS MORE DENSE SO PERHAPS THINGS THAT CLUMPED TOGETHER EARLIER CLUMPED TOGETHER MORE DENSELY AND WHATEVER WAS LEFT OVER IS THE MATTER THAT FORMS THE GALAXIES AROUND CLUMPS OF BLACK HOLES

IS THERE A MAXIMUM DISTANCE FOR AN EVENT TO BE DETECTED THAT IS IF TWO GALAXIES MERGED AND WERE VERY FAR AWAY WOULD THE SIGNAL ARRIVE AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT UNDEGRADED OR WOULD IT FADE OUT
OK THEY FIRST DETECTED SOMETHING THOSE COLLIDING BLACK HOLES ONLY A FEW DAYS AFTER THEY SWITCHED IT ON

HAVE THEY DETECTED ANYTHING SINCE

THIS IS THE BEST TL R I COULD MAKE ORIGINAL REDUCED BY I'M A BOT

BELL'S ARGUMENT DEPENDS ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE CHOICE OF MEASUREMENT SETTINGS AT THE TWO SIDES OF THE EXPERIMENT IS INDEPENDENT OF ANY EARLIER PROPERTIES OR HIDDEN VARIABLES OF THE PARTICLES

THE MIRROR FLIPS HALF OF THE EXPERIMENT IN TIME SO THAT IT NOW LOOKS LIKE AN EXPERIMENT IN WHICH A PHOTON ENTERS THROUGH ONE OF THE TWO CHANNELS AT THE BOTTOM AND LEAVES THROUGH THE CHANNEL ON THE TOP RIGHT HEADING IN THE DIRECTION OF BOB'S MEASURING DEVICE

IN THE ORIGINAL EXPERIMENT EACH OUTPUT CORRESPONDS TO ONE TYPE OF POLARISATION THE ORIENTATION OF THE VIBRATION OF THE PHOTON ANALOGOUS TO THE ANGLE AT WHICH A GUITAR STRING IS VIBRATING

CAN YOU EXPLAIN IT WITHOUT USING THE WORD TOPOLOGICAL
WE DENOTE VELOCITY AS U TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM POTENTIAL AND POTENTIAL AS U TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM VELOCITY
BECAUSE P IS USED TO DENOTE MOMENTUM

IT'S NOT ALWAYS U FOR THE LAGRANGIAN AND HAMILTONIAN TYPICALLY ONE USES V
BECAUSE U HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO CALL IT WHATEVER YOU WANT
WELL THE LETTER ITSELF KINDA RESEMBLES A POTENTIAL WELL THAT'S VERY POST HOC THOUGH
AS FAR AS I KNOW THE POTENTIAL IS ALWAYS CALLED V OR PHI ON THE CASE OF GRAVITATION WHILE THE ENERGY IS CALLED U
THE SCIENTISTS SHOWED THAT THIS ELECTROPHOBIA PROPERTY WOULD ALLOW THE PARTICLE TO SOLVE BOTH THE PROTON AND MUON PROBLEMS

YES IF YOU CAN TUNE THE COUPLING TO EVERY PARTICLE SEPARATELY YOU CAN CHANGE THE MUON G 2 AND PROTON RADIUS MEASUREMENTS WITHOUT GETTING THE ELECTRON MEASUREMENTS WRONG HOW SURPRISING

MASS AND COUPLING STRENGTH OF THIS PROPOSED PARTICLE ARE TWO FREE PARAMETERS AND THEY GET TWO MEASUREMENTS IN AGREEMENT WITH IT AGAIN SURPRISE SURPRISE

I AGREE THAT FOR MORE INVOLVED CALCULATIONS IN EM OR FLUIDS COMPONENT NOTATION IS BETTER DEL NOTATION IS NOT SO TERRIBLE THOUGH FOR ONE IT EMPHASIZES THAT VECTORS ARE OBJECTS INDEPENDENT OF THEIR COMPONENTS IT LOOKS PRETTIER AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IT WORKS IN ANY COORDINATE SYSTEM COMPONENT NOTATION DOESN'T UNLESS YOU USE THE METRIC TENSOR AND UP-AND-DOWN INDICES WHICH IS DEFINITELY NOT SIMPLER
DELETED
MOST CALCULATIONS USING VECTORS IN 3D TEND TO BE EASIER USING VECTOR NOTATION BECAUSE 3D VECTORS ARE A SPECIAL CASE IN WHICH COMPLICATED OPERATIONS TAKE CUTER FORMS THE CURL COMES TO MIND I THINK FEYNMAN HAS A SECTION ON THAT IN HIS LECTURES FURTHERMORE IN ANOTHER SECTION FEYNMAN MENTIONS YOU CAN FURTHER EXTEND THE USEFULNESS OF VECTOR NOTATION BY BEING EXPLICIT ON WHAT EACH DIFFERENTIAL OPERATOR ACTS ON SO YOU CAN WRITE THEM IN ANY ORDER FOR EXAMPLE YOUR D CXI UI U P CAN BE WRITTEN AS U U P WHERE MAKES IT EXPLICIT YOU APPLY NABLA TO EVERYTHING ON ITS RIGHT HAD I WRITTEN U U P THEN IT'S UNCLEAR IF NABLA ACTS ON THE FIRST U OR EVERYTHING WHILE WRITING U U P IS ABSURD DERIVATION OF THE POYNTING VECTOR USING FREE VECTOR NOTATION IS GREAT EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE OR LABORIOUS IN NORMAL VECTOR NOTATION

READ PRESS RELEASE HERE

NEWS ID
IT WOULD BE NICE IF CRYSTALS WERE INCLUDED
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT LASERS OR ORDINARY INCOHERENT LIGHT YOU CAN'T REALLY MAKE A WHITE LIGHT LASER BEAM SO I'LL PRESUME YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT INCOHERENT LIGHT

BOTH BEING LIGHT DOES THE DENSITY OF LIGHT IN AREA X INCREASE

THE QUESTION DOESN'T MAKE SENSE LIGHT ITSELF IT NOT A SUBSTANCE THAT CAN BE SPREAD OVER SPACE THINLY OR THICKLY LIKE PEANUT BUTTER IF YOU'RE ASKING IF THERE'S MORE LIGHT IN X THAN THERE WOULD BE IN ONLY A OR B INDIVIDUALLY WERE ON THEN CERTAINLY YES WE CAN SAY THAT THE INTENSITY OF THE LIGHT IN THAT AREA WILL BE LARGER

HOW DOES X CHANGE BOTH A AND B DOES THE INTERSECTION CAUSE EITHER A OR B TO REDUCE VELOCITY AFTER PASSING THROUGH IT DOES IT CHANGE THE LIGHT BEANS IN ANY WAY

PRESUMING THAT X IS JUST AN EMPTY REGION OF SPACE IT BASICALLY DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING AT THE CLASSICAL LEVEL THE TWO LIGHT BEAMS PASS RIGHT THROUGH EACH OTHER WITHOUT ANY INTERACTION IT'S A LINEAR THEORY SO IF WE KNOW THAT A IS A SOLUTION TO EQUATIONS IN REGION X AND B IS A SOLUTION THEN THE VERY MUNDANE A B IS ALSO A SOLUTION THE VELOCITIES REMAIN EXACTLY THE SAME BECAUSE THE FORM OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE EQUATION DOES NOT CHANGE THERE ARE QUANTUM AND GENERAL RELATIVISTIC CORRECTIONS BUT THEY ARE TINY TINY TINY TINY FOR EVERYDAY LIGHT HERE ON THE EARTH ETC

IS THERE ANY LIGHT RESIDUAL THAT CAN BE DETECTED IN X

IF X CONTAINS SOME KIND OF MATERIAL THEN THERE COULD BE SOME RESIDUAL EFFECT THERE

IF X IS JUST EMPTY SPACE THEN THERE IS ALSO SOME RESIDUAL EFFECT THE ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC FIELDS WILL NOT BE EXACTLY ALWAYS BUT FOR A REALISTIC PULSE OF LIGHT SUCH A RESIDUAL WOULD VERY QUICKLY BECOME TOO SMALL TO MEASURE AND DISTINGUISH FROM RANDOM NOISE

I DOUBT THERE'S ANYTHING SUPER UNEXPECTED GOING ON HERE THE THEORY HAS BEEN AROUND FOR OVER YEARS AT THIS POINT AND IF WE SHIFT FOCUS TO A SIMILAR QUESTION BUT WITH LASERS SUCH SCENARIOS HAPPEN EVERY DAY IN HUNDREDS OR MAYBE THOUSANDS OF PHYSICS LABS IF ANYTHING CRAZY WERE HAPPENING SOMEONE PROBABLY NOTICED IT BUT MAYBE NOT YOU NEVER KNOW FOR SURE
CHOOSING A PROJECT CAN BE DIFFICULT AND OVERWHELMING DO NOT FOCUS SO MUCH ON WHAT PROBLEM TO STUDY BUT RATHER WHAT TOPIC YOU WANT TO EXPLORE YOU HAVE TO DO YOUR OWN SOUL SEARCHING I WOULD RECOMMEND SOMETHING BASIC YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT NOT WHAT SOUNDS SEXY

AFTERWARDS THE WORK YOU DO IN LEARNING THE TOPIC WILL HELP GENERATE A PROBLEM TO EXPLORE ANYTHING YOU DO WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROJECT

HAD TO LEARN NEW MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES BOOM A NEW SECTION OF THE PROJECT APPLYING IT TO A PHYSICAL SCENARIO BOOM ANOTHER SECTION OF THE PROJECT BUILDING A MODEL OF THE PROBLEM BOOM ANOTHER BIT TO PRESENT MAKE SOME GRAPHS TO EXPLORE RELATIONSHIPS OF VARIABLES BOOM YOU GOT YOURSELF SOME DATA
PERHAPS YOU COULD SIMULATE A PHYSICAL SYSTEM THERE ARE A LOT OF PHYSICAL SYSTEMS WHICH CAN BE SIMULATED WITH HIGH SCHOOL KNOWLEDGE AND A BIT OF ADDITIONAL READING ON NUMERICAL INTEGRATION BUT THAT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM IF YOU KNOW CALCULUS FOR EXAMPLE THE THREE BODY PROBLEM YOU CAN DO A SIMPLIFIED VERSION WITH TWO STATIC BODIES AND THE THIRD ONE MOVING IN THEIR GRAVITATIONAL FIELD OR THE DOUBLE PENDULUM THESE WOULD BE COMMON EXAMPLES AND YOU CAN PROBABLY FIND CODE ONLINE IF YOU GET STUCK TOO

YOU CAN ALSO GO INTERDISCIPLINARY BY SIMULATING A BIOLOGICAL OR CHEMICAL SYSTEM MODELED BY EQUATIONS LOOK UP OSCILLATING CHEMICAL REACTIONS FOR EXAMPLE OR THE NEURON MODEL ANYTHING MODELED BY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS REALLY
I LIKE THE DYNAMICAL SYSTEM SIMULATIONS SUGGESTED BELOW HIGHLY ACCESSIBLE AT HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL AND YOU CAN EXPLORE SOME COOL MATHS INCLUDING FRACTALS AND FRACTIONAL DIMENSIONS

I JUST WANTED TO ADD ONE THING
ON A LEVEL OF HIGH SCHOOL PHYSICS INCLUDING QUANTUM MECHANICS

STAY AWAY FROM QUANTUM MECHANICS YOU DO NOT HAVE THE BACKGROUND TO STUDY THIS YET AND WILL NOT UNDERSTAND
EDIT I HAVE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF A QUESTION TO ANSWER FOR EXAMPLE WHY IS THE SKY BLUE
PERHAPS YOU COULD DO A STUDY ON DIFFRACTION LASER AND A HAIR IS PRETTY NEAT PLUS SOUND WAVES WOULD BE EASY TO DEMONSTRATE WITH MUSIC TUNERS AS LONG AS THEY EMIT A SOUND AND YOU CAN CORRESPOND IT TO PARTICLES AS WAVES ELECTRON DIFFRACTION
THE IDEA THAT THE DARWINIAN PRINCIPLE OF NATURAL SELECTION IS THE ONLY UNDERLYING SOURCE FOR THE TRULY NOVEL COMPLEXITY WE FIND NOT JUST IN THE BIOLOGICAL WORLD BUT EVERYWHERE IN THE UNIVERSE

WAT
THE ONLY WAY TO TEST THIS WOULD BE TO MEASURE THE GRAVITATIONAL CONSTANT THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE WOULD THAT PROVE THAT FORCES AND MATTER EVOLVED OR DIDNT BASED ON THE INCONSISTENT VALUES

HELLO I'M HAVING A REAL HARD TIME GETTING AROUND THE REALITY OF A HOLLOW CYLINDER ACCELERATING MORE SLOWLY THAN A SOLID CYLINDER THAT ARE BOTH SET FREE AT THE TOP OF A SLOPE WITH A CONSISTENT ANGLE

I HAVE BEEN LOOKING THINGS UP FOR A DAY OR SO AND I AM BEING TOLD THAT IT IS HARDER TO ACCELERATE A MASS AT A GREATER RADIUS FROM THE CENTRE OF ROTATION THAN A MASS THAT IS CLOSER TO IT I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY THAT IS AND ALL I SEE ARE MATHS EQUATIONS THAT I HAVE AN OKAY GRASP OF BUT WHAT I REALLY CAN'T UNDERSTAND IS THE PHYSICAL REALITY BEHIND THIS I WONDER IF ANYONE CAN ELUCIDATE THIS

I HAVE THIS IDEA IN MY HEAD THAT REFERRING AGAIN TO THE TWO CYLINDERS THE OUTER RINGS OF BOTH SHOULD BE ACCELERATING AT THE SAME RATE BUT THE SOLID ONE ACCELERATES MORE IS THIS INTERIOR OF THE SOLID CYLINDER SOMEHOW PUSHING THE REST OF THE CYLINDER THIS HAS REALLY GOT ME IN A BIND

I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT WATER BEHAVIOR IN A PIPE
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU HAD A PIPE FILLED WITH WATER THAT WENT IN A LOOP AND HEATED THE BOTTOM OF THE LOOP

IMAGINE THAT THE PIPE STARTS OUT AT THE BOTTOM WITH A HEATING ELEMENT OF SOME SORTS ATTACHED TO IT THE PIPE THEN GOES UP FOR A BIT AND THEN FLATTENS OUT WHERE THE HEAT IS REMOVED AGAIN THEN THE PIPE GOES BACK DOWN TO THE HEATING ELEMENT WOULD THE WATER INSIDE START TO REVOLVE AROUND THE LOOP
I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS REGARDING THE FOLLOWING PROBLEM

GIVEN
ANGULAR ACCELERATION RAD S
MASS OF THE OBJECT KG
SHAFT RADIUS M
WHEEL RADIUS M

OBJECT IS CONNECTED TO A STRING WOUND AROUND THE SHAFT OBJECT STARTS AT REST AND FALLS DOWN CAUSING THE SHAFT AND THE WHEEL TO ROTATE WITH AN ANGULAR ACCELERATION OF RAD S

A ASKS FOR LINEAR ACCELERATION
ASKS FOR TENSION IN THE STRING
C ASKS FOR TOTAL MOMENT OF INERTIA OF BOTH THE SHAFT AND THE WHEEL

SO I GOT KG M 2 AS THE ANSWER

MY QUESTION IS

IS THE CORRECT ANSWER OR SHOULD IT BE I'M TOO LAZY TO TYPE IN THE UNITS SORRY

BECAUSE IF THE TOTAL MOMENT OF INERTIA OF BOTH THE SHAFT AND THE WHEEL IS AS STATED THEN IT MEANS THAT I SHAFT I WHEEL KG M 2

THAT CAN'T BE TRUE THOUGH BECAUSE CALCULATING FOR I SHAFT ALONE ALREADY YIELDS KG M 2 AS THE ANSWER USING THE SAME EQUATION

THE ANSWER GIVEN IN THE SOLUTION SECTION SAYS THOUGH

BUT AM I CORRECT TO THINK THAT IS ONLY FOR THE SHAFT AND TO CALCULATE FOR I TOTAL I HAVE TO ADD TO THE VALUE OF I WHEEL WHICH IS THE SAME AS I SHAFT BECAUSE THEY ARE BOTH ROTATED BY THE SAME FORCE AT THE SAME ANGLE AND HAVE THE SAME ANGULAR ACCELERATION FR IA SAME F R A ANGULAR

2 WHEN A SHAFT IS CONNECTED TO A WHEEL AND THEY ROTATE THEY HAVE THE SAME ANGULAR DISPLACEMENT VELOCITY ACCELERATION RIGHT

SORRY FOR THE LONG QUESTION HERE'S A POTATO



BEFORE TYPING THIS I WAS UNSURE BUT RIGHT NOW I THINK I'M CORRECT THE MORE I TYPE THE MORE IT MAKES SENSE


EDIT NO DOESN'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE FR IA ANET R ANET AND IS NOT EQUAL TO
AS SOMEBODY DOUBLE MAJORING IN PHYSICS AND COMP SCI AFTER TALKING WITH MANY PROFESSORS AND PEOPLE IN THE TECH INDUSTRY ALBEIT MOSTLY CYBERSECURITY HERE'S WHAT I HAVE TO SAY TAKE IT FOR WHAT YOU WILL WHAT I SAY IS BY NO MEANS LAW AND I COULD BE COMPLETELY WRONG

ACCORDING TO MY UNDERGRAD RESEARCH ADVISOR PHYSICS DEGREE IS THE TYPE OF DEGREE PEOPLE SEE AND WILL WANT TO HIRE YOU IT REPRESENTS A HIGHER ABILITY OF AS WELL AS GRASPING COMPLEX CONCEPTS SO WITH A PHYSICS DEGREE ALONE YOU LIKELY HAVE A CHANCE AT A JOB SOMEWHERE IN THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY ALBEIT IF ALL YOU HAVE IS THE DEGREE AND ZERO PROGRAMMING KNOWLEDGE THAT CHANCE IS LOWERED AND YOU WILL LIKELY BE IN A LOWER TIER POSITION NOW IF YOU DO HAVE PROGRAMMING KNOWLEDGE WHICH IT SEEMS LIKE YOU DO AS I WOULD HOPE ANY PHYSICS MAJOR WOULD AT THIS POINT THIS GREATLY INCREASES YOUR CHANCES

NOW IT LOOKS LIKE C IS THE ONLY LANGUAGE YOU FEEL THAT YOU KNOW THOUGH YOU UNDERSTAND SOME MORE CONCEPTS I WOULD DEFINITELY SPEND SOME FREE TIME LEARNING ANOTHER LANGUAGE OR TWO BEFORE YOU APPLY TO A JOB LOOK AT JOBS YOU WANT TO APPLY FOR SEE WHAT THEIR REQUIREMENTS ARE LEARN IF REASONABLE THE LANGUAGES OR CONCEPTS THAT THE JOB IS LOOKING FOR

WHAT IF THE JOB POSTING IS VAGUE WELL IF THE AD IS TRULY BEING THAT VAGUE LEARN SOME OF THE MORE POPULAR LANGUAGES AS OF LATE YOU HAVE C KNOWLEDGE SO LEARNING OTHERS SPECIFICALLY PYTHON AND C SHOULD BE MUCH EASIER THAN IF YOU WERE STARTING FROM NOTHING OR COMING FROM ANOTHER LANGUAGE

THE FIRST TYPE PROBABLY THE MAJORITY AMONG PEOPLE WHO CALL THEMSELVES MATHEMATICAL PHYSICISTS WORK ON MATHEMATICALLY RIGOROUS FORMULATIONS OF PROBLEMS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS THEY USE A THEOREM LEMMA PROOF CONSTRUCTION APPLYING A MATHEMATICAL METHODOLOGY TO PROBLEMS MOTIVATED BY PHYSICS THE GOAL IS TO VERY PRECISELY SPECIFY PHYSICAL PROBLEMS AND DERIVE THEIR SOLUTIONS WITHOUT ANY UNSTATED ASSUMPTIONS VAGUELY DEFINED TERMS OR ARGUMENTS THEIR WORK USUALLY FOLLOWS BEHIND THE FRONTIER IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS JUSTIFYING AND CLARIFYING THINGS THAT WERE POORLY UNDERSTOOD AT FIRST THEIR WORK IS VALUABLE TO MATHEMATICIANS BECAUSE FREQUENTLY THEIR PROOFS INVOLVE NOVEL MATHEMATICAL TOOLS AND IDEAS IT IS VALUABLE TO PHYSICISTS BECAUSE IT REMOVES ANY AMBIGUITY OR DISPUTE ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF A THEORY AND SOMETIMES DISCOVERS SUBTLE ERRORS IN WHAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY ARGUED A PROTOTYPICAL EXAMPLE IN THIS CATEGORY IS JOHN VON NEUMANN


THE SECOND TYPE ARE BROADLY CONCERNED WITH A SORT OF OPPOSITE APPROACH WHERE THE METHODOLOGY OF PHYSICS IS APPLIED TO MATHEMATICS THESE GUYS ARE OUT THERE EXPLORING SOME ASPECTS OF MATHEMATICS WHICH THEY CAN INVESTIGATE VIA EXAMPLE AND EXPERIMENT BUT CANNOT YET GENERATE PROOFS FOR THE PROBLEMS THEY WORK ON ARE USUALLY INSPIRED BY PHYSICS PROBLEMS EITHER IN THE SENSE THAT THE MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURE IS THAT IS SIMILAR TO SOME PHYSICS PROBLEM BUT DIFFERENT IN A WAY NOT NECESSARILY MOTIVATED BY PHYSICS OR IN THE SENSE THAT THEY ARE DEVELOPING NEW MATHEMATICAL TOOLS FOR THEORETICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICISTS TO USE CARL BENDER IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS KIND OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICIST

THERE ARE PHYSICAL MATHEMATICIANS AND MATHEMATICAL PHYSICISTS IT DEPENDS ON WHICH IDENTITY YOU IDENTIFY WITH MORE PICK THE ACADEMIC ATTITUDE YOU PREFER GO TO THAT DEPARTMENT AND THEN FIND COLLABORATORS IN THE OTHER ONE SO IF YOU ARE A BIT FAST AND LOOSE YOU CAN GO TO A PHYSICS DEPARTMENT AND THEN FIND A MATH FRIEND WHO LIKES A SIMILAR PROBLEM WHO CAN KEEP YOU HONEST
I THINK THE CLOSEST THING TO A PHYSICS MATHEMATICIAN WOULD BE A MATHEMATICAL PHYSICIST THAT FIELD DEALS WITH DEVELOPING MATHEMATICAL TOOLS FOR USE IN SOLVING PHYSICAL PROBLEMS FOR EXAMPLE FINDING NUMERICAL METHODS FOR SOLVING THE EQUATIONS MIGHT BE SOMETHING A MATHEMATICAL PHYSICIST DEALS WITH
WHAT IS THE CURRICULUM SURELY THERE'S A BUDGET TOO RIGHT
DOING SOME KIND OF OPTICAL ALIGNMENT WITH LOW POWERED LASERS WOULD BE FUN AND KINDA AFFORDABLE KIDS GET TO WEAR SAFETY GLASSES TOO
SOME OF THE THINGS I REMEMBER FROM MY INTRO TO PHYSICS IN COLLEGE THAT REALLY INTERESTED ME WHICH IS WHAT I BELIEVE THE POINT OF AN INTRO COURSE IS AFTER ALL

DOUBLE SLIT EXPERIMENT

USING POLARIZING FILTERS TO DEMONSTRATE HOW ADDING A 3RD FILTER AT DEGREES IN-BETWEEN TWO COMPLETELY PERPENDICULAR FILTERS CAN ALLOW MORE LIGHT TO PASS

USING A BUNCH OF SMALL COMPASSES TO VISUALIZE A MAGNETIC FIELD ALSO GENERATING A MAGNETIC FIELD WITH ELECTRICITY AND WIRES THAT CAN BE VIEWED
A FUN ONE THAT WE HAD IN OUR HIGH SCHOOL WAS THE TEACHER HAD BUILT A RUBENS TUBE TO DEMONSTRATE STANDING WAVES FIRE ALWAYS ADDS A DRAMATIC FLARE TO THINGS
DO A SEARCH OF SOME UNIVERSITY PHYSICS AND 2 LABS IT COSTS A LOT JUST TO BUY THE BASICS RULERS MASS SETS CARTS TRACKS STOPWATCHES PULLEYS THE TOTAL COST OF SETTING UP A RESPECTABLE STUDENT PHYSICS LAB FROM SCRATCH IS OVER DOES THE DEPARTMENT KNOW THIS
HAVE YOU TRIED THE BINET EQUATION
WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH LAGRANGIAN MECHANICS TURN IT INTO AN EFFECTIVE BODY PROBLEM IN THE RADIAL DIRECTION THEN JUST FOLLOW THE SAME STEPS YOU WOULD FOR THE KEPLER PROBLEM
NOTHING I JUST GRADUATED WAVES TO THE AUDIENCE
STUDYING THE ENTANGLEMENT STRUCTURE OF THE ASAT PROBLEM THROUGH PATH INTEGRAL MONTE CARLO FOR MY MASTERS THESIS I AM STILL LOOKING AROUND FOR SOME LITERATURE SO SUGGESTIONS ARE WELCOME
I'M A BIOLOGIST THAT USES SOME PHYSICS I HAVE A LOT OF DATA AND SIMULATIONS SHOWING HOW DIFFERENT PHYSICAL PARAMETERS CHANGE HOW SPATIAL PROXIMITY OF ONE BACTERIAL COLONY TO ANOTHER ALTERS THEIR FITNESS WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO FOR ABOUT A MONTH NOW IS FIGURE OUT SOME WAY TO COMBINE THESE PARAMETERS INTO A SORT OF MASTER PARAMETER

NO REAL LUCK YET ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THERE IS IN SOME OF THE PARAMETERS AND MY MATH BACKGROUND ISN'T GREAT SO I HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE DOING AND OTHER METHODS OF REDUCING PARAMETER SPACE
LEARNING AND MESSING AROUND WITH JULIA
EVERY BLOODY WEEK FOR THE LAST FEW MONTHS MY ANSWER TO THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME FINALLY I'M WRITING IT ALL UP FOR MY FIRST PEER REVIEWED PAPER SO NEXT TIME THIS THREAD POPS UP HOPEFULLY THERE WILL BE A DIFFERENT ANSWER I'M FINDING WRITING THE INTRODUCTION BY FAR THE HARDEST PART AS I'M CONFIDENT IN THE SCIENCE ITSELF BUT NOT SO SURE ABOUT ITS CONTEXT AND RELEVANCE TO THE WIDER FIELD
AFTER LOOKING AT CATEGORY THEORY FOR SCIENTISTS I'M FINALLY GOING OVER THE BAEZ PAPER AND REALLY GETTING AN UNDERSTANDING OF BRAIDED CONOIDAL CATEGORIES IT'S A SURPRISINGLY INTERESTING READ BUT DOESN'T GO OVER MUCH PHYSICS BESIDES EXPLAINING SOME GROUP THEORY IN QUANTUM MECHANICS IT'S STILL HARD FOR ME TO FORM A CONNECTION ON WHY THIS IS USEFUL AND HOW DATA CAN BACK UP THE STRUCTURAL CLAIMS PRESENTED IN A CATEGORY THEORY INTERPRETATION BUT I'M CHUGGING ALONG
MY LITERATURE REVIEW BEFORE I START MY MPHPS IN A FEW WEEKS TRYING TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND SCINTILLATORS AND EVERYTHING ASSOCIATED WITH THEM
SAME THING THAT I HAVE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST WEEKS STUDYING FOR MY ORAL MATH EXAM
PROJECTION MAPPING FOR AN ART EXHIBIT AND TESTING RANDOM NUMBERS ACADEMIC RESEARCH
WORKING ON A REVIEW OF ELECTROWEAK BARYOGENESIS FOR MY MASTER THESIS
ANALYSING EELS MAPS OF RANDOMLY ORGANISED CLUSTERS OF GOLD LOOKING FOR WHICH ENERGIES OF PLASMODIC RESONANCES YOU CAN EXCITE IN THE SYSTEM SINCE IT WILL HOPEFULLY HELP US UNDERSTAND THE OPTICAL PROPERTIES WE HAVE OBSERVED FROM THE SAME SAMPLES BEFORE

SO FAR I'M JUST TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE OVERWHELMING AMOUNT OF DATA AND HOW ALMOST EACH INDIVIDUAL SPECTRUM NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED INDIVIDUALLY MAKING IT HARD WRITE AN ALGORITHM THAT'S NOT INCREDIBLY SLOW BUT STILL DOESN'T DISTORT THE DATA TOO MUCH IN THE CORRECTIONS
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE BACKGROUND FOR ONE PROCESSES LOOKS SO DIFFERENT FROM OTHER SIMILAR ONES
NOTHING INTERESTING MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE SUCKS
MIGHT HAVE TO DO SOME MORE EXPERIMENTS TO GET THE PAPER I'M WORKING ON TO A PUBLISHABLE LEVEL
LEARNING BEANT
AT A CONFERENCE PURELY OUT OF GEOGRAPHICAL CONVENIENCE ALSO SETTING UP A BUNCH OF SCRIPTS
THERE ARE TWO SOMEWHAT INDEPENDENT PROPERTIES THERMAL MASS HOW MUCH JUICE YOU HAVE TO PUMP INTO SOMETHING TO RAISE ITS TEMPERATURE AND THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY HOW QUICKLY EASILY HEAT FLOWS THROUGH SOMETHING

YOUR QUESTION AS STATED READS LIKE I AM CONFUSED CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHAT QUESTION MAKES SENSE TO ASK IT'S ABOUT HEAT EXCHANGE
THAT USUALLY FALLS IN THE AREA OF OCEANOGRAPHY AND I THINK THERE IS A LIMITED DEMAND FOR IT JOBS ARE MOSTLY GAS AND OIL EXPLORATION AND FIELD SIMULATION WITH GEOLOGISTS AS FAR AS I KNOW WHAT ARE THE FEW PROGRAMS SPECIFICALLY YOU FIND INTERESTING
IT SEEMS FROM THE CONTEXT IT MEANS DAYS

I'VE NEVER SEEN IT WRITTEN LIKE THAT BUT IN ASTRONOMY THEY WRITE STUFF LIKE H M S FOR THE RIGHT ASCENSION OF A STAR
I HAVE NEVER SEEN THAT STYLE OF NOTATION BEFORE IT SEEMS LIKE THIS WOULD BE DEFINED SOMEWHERE EARLIER IN THE BOOK DOUBLE CHECK
IT MAY BE A SUPERSCRIPT THAT SPECIFIES DAYS AND ITS POSITION OVER THE DECIMAL POINT MAY BE A COINCIDENCE IF THE CHARACTER IS MEANT TO APPEAR AS A SUPERSCRIPT TO A VALUE THAT'S TO THE LEFT OF A DECIMAL POINT IN OTHER WORDS FIVE DAYS WOULD BE INDICATED AS D BUT IN THESE EXAMPLES THE VALUES AREN'T INTEGERS AND THE PROXIMITY OF THE SUPERSCRIPT AND THE DECIMAL POINT MAY HAVE NO SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE

JUST A GUESS

MAYBE IS JUST A WAY TO EXPRESS DECIMAL

MAYBE THEY JUST WANTED THE D I'LL SHOW MYSELF OUT NO NEED TO SHOVE
FLUID MECHANICS BY LANDAU AND LIFSHITZ IT IS A VERY NICE INTRODUCTION YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND IT IN ANY UNIVERSITY LIBRARY
IN MY OPINION

BRENNEN CHRISTOPHER EAST CAVITATION AND BUBBLE DYNAMICS CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PRESS

IS A MUST ONCE YOU'VE STUDIED THE GENERAL TOPIC THERE SHOULD BE A FREE MANUSCRIPT PDF OF IT IF YOU LOOK ON GOOGLE SEARCH
THERE ARE A FEW DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS OF MATTER ONE OF THEM BEING ANYTHING WITH MASS BUT A MORE COMMON ONE BEING ANYTHING WITH MASS AND VOLUME ACCORDING TO THE FIRST DEFINITION YES AND THE SECOND NUMBER BUT POSITRONS ARE GENERALLY CONSIDERED TO BE ANTIMATTER DESPITE LACKING VOLUME
YES THEY MATTER VERY MUCH
ENGINEER HERE CAREFULLY
OPTICAL AND RADAR METHODS ARE IMPORTANT FOR MEASUREMENTS LIKE THIS BRAGG REFLECTIONS DOPPLER ANALYSIS ETC ARE ACTIVE METHODS PASSIVE METHODS INVOLVE SPECTRAL ANALYSIS OFTEN USING AN INTERFEROMETER AND LOOKING AT PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE BROADENING AND THE DOPPLER SHIFT TO DETERMINE PRESSURE TEMPERATURE VELOCITY OF A TARGET GAS VOLUME OPTICAL EMISSION THE VOIGHT PROFILE IS ONE TOOL FOR THIS
IF YOU KNOW THE AIR PRESSURE TEMPERATURE AND COMPOSITION OF THE ATMOSPHERE YOU COULD JUST CALCULATE IT THAT WAY

BUT SINCE YOUR ASKING I'LL TRY TO ANSWER WHAT KIND OF PRESSURES AND TEMPERATURES ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE SPEED OF SOUND IS ROUGHLY INDEPENDENT OF THE MEDIUM'S PRESSURE BUT THE VOLUME OF IT DECREASES MUCH MORE RAPIDLY IN A LOW PRESSURE ENVIRONMENT BUT THIS QUESTION SEEMS TO INVOLVE MORE THAN BOTH OF THOSE CONCEPTS
I LIKED THIS LINE

I SHOULD HOWEVER GIVE JUSTICE TO OTHER EXPERIMENTS THAT ALSO DON'T FIND NEW PHYSICS OFTEN IN A SPECTACULAR WAY

IF THE GET PUSHED DOWN TO THE NEUTRINO FLOOR THAT'LL BE REALLY IMPRESSIVE FROM AN EXPERIMENTAL PERSPECTIVE BUT ALSO KIND OF DEPRESSING I KINDA HOPE IT'S ANIONS
WHAT SS MODEL WAS USED TO SIMULATE THE DM REGIONS OF THAT PLOT

MASM PASSIM
IF THE BEINGS ARE MADE ENTIRELY OF LIGHT THE ONLY WAY FOR THEIR WHOLE BODY TO MOVE AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT IS IF ALL THE LIGHT MOVES PERFECTLY PARALLEL IN WHICH CASE IT'S NOT POSSIBLE FOR THE RELATIVE POSITIONS OF THE LIGHT RAYS TO CHANGE OVER TIME IN OTHER WORDS THESE BEINGS CANNOT CHANGE OVER TIME WHICH MEANS THEY CAN'T BE SENTIENT OR PERCEIVE ANYTHING IN ORDER FOR THE LIGHT TO BOUNCE AROUND AND DO ANY KIND OF THINKING IT WOULD HAVE TO TAKE A PATH THAT HAS A LOWER AVERAGE SPEED IN WHICH CASE THE BODY AS A WHOLE WOULD BEHAVE LIKE IT HAS MASS IN FACT YOU CAN ROUGHLY THINK OF ELECTRONS AS AROUND AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT BUT THE AVERAGE VELOCITY IS LOWER AND THIS IS WHY THEY HAVE MASS IT'S CALLED ZITTERBEWEGUNG

THE OTHER ANSWER IS THAT YOU CAN'T DEFINE AN INERTIAL FRAME WHERE LIGHT IS AT REST IT ALWAYS TRAVELS AT C WHICH MEANS TRAVELERS AT LIGHTSPEED CAN'T SEE SPACETIME THE SAME WAY WE DO IF AT ALL
DO YOU THINK SOME PHYSICS PROBLEMS ARE INCAPABLE OF BEING SOLVED WHATSOEVER AND THAT HUMANS WILL ONLY UNDERSTAND A LIMITED FRACTION OF PHYSICS

THAT MIGHT BE TRUE BUT THERE'S LITTLE POINT IN TRYING TO BRING SUCH A PHILOSOPHICAL TOPIC TO ANY KIND OF CONCLUSION BECAUSE IF WE CAN'T DIRECTLY RESOLVE BASIC PHYSICS QUESTIONS WITH THE POWERFUL TOOLS AT OUR DISPOSAL THEN IT FOLLOWS THAT A ABOUT THE POWER OF PHYSICS TO RESOLVE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS IS HANDICAPPED TO A MUCH GREATER EXTENT

PUT MORE SIMPLY AND IN MY OPINION IT'S BETTER TO EXPLORE THE THEORIES AND EVIDENCE DIRECTLY AND SEE WHERE THAT TAKES US THAN TO TRY TO ANTICIPATE HOW THAT SEARCH MIGHT TURN OUT IF INSTEAD WE TRY TO DRAW A CONCLUSION AT A PHILOSOPHICAL REMOVE FROM A DIRECT ENGAGEMENT WITH THEORIES AND EVIDENCE WE PUT OURSELVES IN THE POSITION OF A CENTURY PROFESSOR WHO ADVISED THE YOUNG MAX PLANCK NOT TO PURSUE A CAREER IN PHYSICS SAYING IN THIS FIELD ALMOST EVERYTHING IS ALREADY DISCOVERED AND ALL THAT REMAINS IS TO FILL A FEW UNIMPORTANT HOLES
I'M UNDECIDED ABOUT WHETHER A THEORY OF EVERYTHING EXISTS MAYBE THERE ARE CULTURAL EVOLUTIONARY MATHEMATICAL SEE GODEL REASONS WHY OUR THEORIES WILL ONLY EVER BE ABLE TO PREDICT A SUBSET OF THE PHENOMENA THAT THE UNIVERSE HAS TO OFFER IF SUCH A THEORY IS IMPOSSIBLE INACCESSIBLE TO THE HUMAN MIND THEN THERE IS STILL A LOT OF FUN TO BE HAD IN LEARNING HOW TO SELECT THE RIGHT INCOMPLETE THEORY FOR THE JOB ALSO IN GENERATING STILL MORE INCOMPLETE THEORIES TO BE TREATED AS ALTERNATIVES

EXISTENCE ALWAYS HOGS THE SPOTLIGHT THOUGH WHAT ABOUT UNIQUENESS SUPPOSE THAT THERE IS SUCH A THAT WOULD COMPLETE OUR PICTURE OF THE WORLD PERFECTLY IS THERE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS UNIQUE COULDN'T THERE BE TWO THEORIES THAT ARE INCOMPATIBLE BUT THAT EACH SUFFICE TO DESCRIBE AND PREDICT EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PREDICTED I THINK THERE COULD BE AND THAT HAVING TWO EQUIVALENTLY POWERED BUT STRUCTURALLY DIFFERING THEORIES WOULD BE A REALLY NEAT THING PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO OUR ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE AND TEACH ALL THIS THEORY STUFF
NEWS


SOME PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE UNSOLVABLE
I THINK OUR THEORIES WILL ALWAYS BE INCOMPLETE AND THERE WILL ALWAYS BE UNSOLVED PROBLEMS BUT I ALSO THINK THAT WE AREN'T EVEN CLOSE TO HITTING ANY SORT OF LIMIT OR BARRIER TO OUR NATURAL STILL PLENTY MORE TO DISCOVER USING OUR CURRENT TECHNIQUES ALSO I THINK THAT ANY BARRIERS TO OUR CAPABILITY COULD BE PUSHED BACK CONSIDERABLY USING EUGENICS OR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE LONG TERM CURRENTLY BOTH OF THOSE TECHNIQUES EUGENICS AND AI SEEM INCREDIBLY RISKY AND EVEN DANGEROUS HOPEFULLY WE WILL WAIT UNTIL WE CAN IMPLEMENT THEM BENEVOLENTLY RATHER THAN BEING HASTY WITH THEM
I DON'T THINK PHYSICS WILL END BY ANY MEANS BUT A SUSTAINED LACK OF PROGRESS ON THE FUNDAMENTAL FRONT MEANS THAT IT WILL LIKELY GRADUALLY RECEDE FROM ITS SPOT AT THE HEAD OR THE BASE IF YOU WANT OF THE SCIENCES AND BECOME ONE AMONG MANY AGAIN
NATURE JOURNAL FULL
I AM HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE WORD LIMITED AM I THE ONLY ONE I APOLOGIZE IF I STATE THE OBVIOUS
THE SYNERGY BETWEEN THEORY AND EXPERIMENT IS THE TRUE PHILOSOPHICAL POWER OF MODERN SCIENCE DIRAC FERMI HIGGS ALL SOLVED EXISTING PROBLEMS AND PREDICTED DISCOVERIES BY USING PURE MATHEMATICS SO NOT ONLY WERE EXISTING PROBLEMS SOLVED UNIFICATION OF SR AND QM BUT PREDICTIONS WERE MADE THAT COULD GUIDE FUTURE RESEARCH

BASED ON COMMENTS SO FAR IT WOULD SEEM THAT THESE RESULTS ARE TRIVIAL AND LIMITED THIS IS AN IGNORANT POINT OF VIEW OF COURSE THERE ARE MAJOR CHALLENGES AND PERHAPS ULTIMATE KNOWLEDGE PHYSICS DOWN TO PLANCK SCALES MAY BE IMPOSSIBLE SINCE I AM NOT EINSTEIN OR CHRANDASAQAR I FIND IT FAR MORE REWARDING AND USEFUL TO LEARN HOW WE KNOW WHAT WE KNOW I DO THE MATH AND THEREBY UNDERSTAND THE BASIS OF OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS

ALSO IT'S OFTEN NOT UNDERSTOOD HOW SEEMINGLY OPPOSITE PERSPECTIVES I EAST PARTICLES WAVES ARE COMMONLY REFERRED TO WITHIN THE SAME EXPERIMENT OR MODEL THE UNIVERSE DECIDES THE CONTEXT OF WHICH THEORY IS MORE USEFUL IN A PRACTICAL SETTING OUTSIDERS SEEM TO FOCUS ON HOW WRONG NEWTON LIMITED AS IT MAY BE IT'S STILL GOOD ENOUGH TO LAUNCH PROBES TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM

FINALLY THERE REALLY ARE FUNDAMENTAL SYMMETRIES IN OUR UNIVERSE THAT GUIDE ANY ADVANCED FORMS ASKING SIMILAR QUESTION AS WE DO THEY MAY USE DIFFERENT SYMBOLS BUT THE MATH WILL BE THE SAME THERE PERIODIC TABLE WILL CONSIST OF THE SAME ELEMENTS WITH SAME TRENDS
ALL PROBLEMS HAVE ANSWERS THESE ANSWERS MAY ESCAPE US FOR NOW THERE IS GENIUS YET UNBORN THAT CAN AND EVENTUALLY WILL SOLVE ALL QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS
THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE CANNOT KNOW FOR SURE HOW MUCH THERE IS THAT WE DON'T KNOW THE AMOUNT WE KNOW COULD BE A TRILLIONTH OF WHAT THERE IS TO KNOW OR EVEN TINIER THAN THAT
BUT WE ALREADY HAVE A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE PHYSICS WHICH EFFECTS EVERY DAY LIFE AND A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PHYSICS BEYOND THAT

UNIFICATION IS THE LAST MAJOR RESULT IS THAT A SMALL OR LARGE FRACTION OF WHAT THERE IS TO KNOW
PERHAPS THERE WILL ALWAYS BE PHYSICS OUT OF REACH FOR INSTANCE THE THEORETICAL CEILING ON PARTICLE ENERGIES AKA PLANCK MASS WILL SEEMINGLY NEVER BE APPROACHED ON THE OTHER HAND I THINK BETTER COMPUTING TECHNIQUES WILL HELP AUGMENT HUMAN PROGRESS AND UNDERSTANDING THERE HAS ALREADY BEEN SUCCESS IN CREATING AI THAT CAN WORK ON PROBLEMS IN PHYSICS AS WE GET CLOSER TO PRODUCING ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE IT MAY ONLY BE A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE SOFTWARE EXCEEDS OUR OWN ABILITY TO PRODUCE NOVEL SOLUTIONS
I THINK THAT SLOW OR LONG TERM PERIODIC PHENOMENA WITH PERIODS LONGER THAN A HUMAN LIFESPAN IS OUR GREAT WEAKNESS BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERCOME
I DUNNO PHYSICISTS ARE PRETTY CLEVER EVEN IF PARTICLES ARE MADE OF STRINGS AND STRINGS ARE MADE OF FABRICS AND FABRICS ARE MADE OF KNOTS AND KNOTS ARE MADE OF TWISTS AND SO ON TO SMALLER AND SMALLER DISTANCE SCALES IN AN INFINITE RECURSION SOMEBODY WILL PROBABLY COME UP WITH A AT SOME POINT THAT EXPLAINS THE RECURSION ITSELF ALLOWING YOU TO PREDICT WHICH THEORY IS VALID AT THE NTH RECURSION STEP
REALLY HOPE WE DISCOVER WHAT THE NATURE OF DARK MATTER IS IT IS PERHAPS THE MOST PERPLEXING MEASURABLE PHENOMENA WE HAVE THAT CURRENTLY HAS NO AGREED UPON MECHANISM
PEOPLE SEEM TO ENJOY PHILOSOPHIZING OVER THE INTANGIBLES

IN THIS CASE THE QUESTION IS ALMOST
THIS IS PROBABLY AN ABUSE BUT WOULDN'T INCOMPLETENESS THM SAY NOT EVERYTHING COULD BE PROVED
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THE HUMANITY WILL NEVER FIND THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING IT SEEMS UTOPIAN
DO YOU THINK SOME PHYSICS PROBLEMS ARE INCAPABLE OF BEING SOLVED WHATSOEVER

YES MOSTLY ONES FROM SCIENCE FICTION FTL OTHER ENERGY SOURCES THAN WE ALREADY KNOW ETC ETC

AND THAT HUMANS WILL ONLY UNDERSTAND A LIMITED FRACTION OF PHYSICS

UNLIKELY THE PROBLEMS WILL PERSIST BECAUSE THERE ARE LIMITS TO WHAT WE WE CAN DO AND WE CAN SEE A GREAT DEAL OF THE LIMITS ALREADY HOWEVER DUE TO THE LIMITS OF HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY WE MAY ALWAYS BE DRIVEN TO BELIEVE THERE IS MORE SIMPLY BECAUSE WE ARE EASILY DISAPPOINTED WITH LESS SO EXPECT RELIGION TO GAIN MORE ADHERENTS AS SCIENCE CLOSES THE BOOK ON WHAT IS POSSIBLE ALREADY WE SEE A MASSIVE BACKLASH WHENEVER SCIENCE DETERMINES SOMETHING TO BE IMPOSSIBLE
IF WE CAN CREATE TRUE AI WHICH WOULD SUBSEQUENTLY LEAD TO NEW DISCOVERIES THEN I BELIEVE THAT A THEORY OF EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE ALTHOUGH I RECKON THAT TIME IS AGAINST US ON THAT ONE I THINK THE MORE IMPORTANT QUESTION IS WHETHER WE CAN FIGURE ENOUGH OUT TO SAVE OURSELVES BEFORE WE WIPE EACH OTHER OUT THROUGH WAR OR OVER POPULATION
THERE IS AN INHERENT ASYMMETRY IN THE TYPICAL STATES OF OBJECTS IN OUR UNIVERSE BASICALLY THE MICROSTATE OF THERMODYNAMIC SYSTEMS YOU CAN BUILD WILL BE STRUCTURED IN SUCH A WAY THAT EVOLVED IN THE FUTURE S INCREASES IN THE PAST DECREASES

WHEN SOMEONE TRIES TO BULLSHIT THAT IT CAN BE PROVEN FROM BASIC PROBABILITY THEORY THAT ENTROPY MUST INCREASE YOU KNOW HE'S LYING BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THE MICROSCOPIC SYSTEM SHOULD BE INVARIANT AS YOU CORRECTLY FOUNDATION IT CANNOT BE PROVEN BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY NOT GENERALLY TRUE WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS IS THAT IN OUR UNIVERSE THE STATES WILL BELONG TO A PARTICULAR SUBSET OF STATES FOR WHICH THE SECOND LAW HOLDS

AND THIS IS ALL BECAUSE OF CONTEXT OUR UNIVERSE HAPPENS TO HAVE TWO TIME ENDPOINTS WITH DIFFERENT ENTROPY THEREFORE S WILL INCREASE FROM THE MINIMUM TO THE MAXIMUM THIS WILL INDUCE THAT PARTICULAR PROPERTY IN THE STATES OF SUBSYSTEMS OF THE UNIVERSE SO THAT THEY ALSO WILL SATISFY THE SECOND LAW WHEN ISOLATED

THE CORRECT WAY TO APPROACH THIS THEN IS TO SAY ASSUME THE INITIAL BIG BANG AND FINAL HEAT DEATH BIG RIP CREDITS ROLLING WHATEVER THAT IS STATES ARE FIXED BOUNDARY CONDITIONS THEN YOU SAMPLE RANDOMLY FROM POSSIBLE HISTORIES OF THE UNIVERSE WHICH SATISFY THOSE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS WHAT YOU'LL FIND IS THAT WITH EXTREMELY HIGH PROBABILITY THE TYPICAL HISTORY WILL BE SUCH THAT ENTROPY IS MOSTLY WELL DEFINED AT MOST TIMES AND IT INCREASES MONOTONICALLY AS TIME FLOWS
AS THE TABLE SORTED BY DATE SHOWS ALL THE MORE RECENT DID NOT SHOW ANY ANOMALY THE FIRST OF ROSETTA IN EARLY WAS THE LAST ONE AFTERWARDS WE HAD WITHOUT ANOMALY FOR HAYABUSA 2 I DIDN'T FIND DATA

WHATEVER IT WAS IT IS PROBABLY GONE AND ASSUMING THE LAWS OF PHYSICS DO NOT CHANGE OVER TIME IT WAS PROBABLY NOT A REAL EFFECT
A COUPLE OF PROFESSORS AT MY UNIVERSITY DEVELOPED AN ALTERNATIVE THEORY OF EM THAT IS SPECIAL RELATIVITY IS FALSE TO EXPLAIN THIS AND THE PIONEER ANOMALY AND ONE OF THEM GAVE A TALK ON IT IT WAS REALLY A SIGHT TO BEHOLD SOME OF THE TOP RESEARCHERS OF THE DEPARTMENT SITTING IN THE FRONT ROW WAITING LIKE LIONS FOR THE TALK TO BE OVER SO THEY COULD DEMOLISH THE SPEAKER
IS THIS MORE THAN RANDOM LINK TO A WIKIPEDIA PAGE
FARMSCAPE ANYONE
I'M PRETTY SURE THIS ONE IS NOW UNDER SOLVED

SOMETHING TO DO WITH DIFFERENTIAL HEAT RADIATION
NUMBER YOU NEED A SECOND BACHELORS DEGREE YOU CANNOT DO A GRADUATE DEGREE IN PHYSICS WITH A BUSINESS DEGREE AND BACKGROUND THAT SAID I DON'T RECOMMEND A SECOND BACHELORS IN PHYSICS ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING WOULD BE A BETTER SECOND BACHELORS BUT IF YOU ARE MORE THEORETICALLY ORIENTED I WOULDN'T SUGGEST IT EITHER ALSO WANTING A MASTERS IN PHYSICS IS WEIRD ESPECIALLY THEORETICAL PHYSICS IT'S COMMON FOR A PHYSICIST TO SPEND YEARS IN UNDERGRAD THEN YEARS IN GRAD SCHOOL THEN YEARS POST DOC THEN GET A JOB SOMEWHERE AND REFER TO HIMSELF AS AN ENGINEER

THERE IS A CHANCE YOU COULD GET INTO AN APPLIED MATHEMATICS GRADUATE PROGRAM IF YOU SPEND A COUPLE YEARS PREPARING INCLUDING TAKING SOME CREDITS AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE

I'M LOOKING TO FORMALLY AND DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE MY PHYSICS KNOWLEDGE

2 YEARS SPENT LEARNING PHYSICS EVEN AS A GRADUATE DEGREE WON'T DO JACK SHIT EVEN IF SOMEHOW YOU GOT INTO A GRADUATE PROGRAM AND PASSED WHICH YOU WOULDN'T YOU WON'T BE ANY CLOSER TO UNDERSTANDING

BEING A COMPETENT ENGINEER OR SCIENTIST TAKES MORE THAN A DECADE OF SCHOOL EXPERIENCE IT'S LIKE BEING A DOCTOR SOME DISCIPLINES ARE MORE FORGIVING BUT THE HARDCORE ONES LIKE PHYSICS ACT LIKE A MEAT GRINDER THIS ISN'T SOMETHING YOU CAN PUT 2 YEARS INTO AND GET ANYTHING USEFUL OUT OF IT

IF YOU HAD A REAL DEGREE INSTEAD OF A BUSINESS DEGREE SOMETHING WITH MATHEMATICS IN IT YOU STILL WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO JUMP INTO A PHYSICS GRADUATE PROGRAM THAT SHIT IS HARD YOU WOULD NEED TO PREPARE CONSIDERABLY BEFORE APPLYING YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T NEED A SECOND BACHELORS BUT IT WOULD TAKE HUNDREDS OF HOURS
AN ALTERNATIVE TO CONSIDER IS JUST SELF STUDY SINCE IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE MAINLY IN IT FOR THE SAKE OF LEARNING PICK YOUR FAVORITE GOOD SCHOOL AND LOOK UP THEIR UNDERGRAD PHYSICS CURRICULUM A LOT OF THEM WILL PROBABLY HAVE MOST OF THE RELEVANT COURSE MATERIALS AVAILABLE ONLINE IF YOU CAN'T FIND ANYTHING YOU CAN PM ME AND I CAN GIVE YOU MORE SPECIFIC LINKS AND THEN YOU CAN JUST GET THE TEXTBOOKS AND STUDY ON YOUR OWN TIME YOU'D PROBABLY HAVE A HARD TIME FINDING A POSITION IN A PHD PROGRAM THOUGH I DON'T KNOW THAT FOR SURE AND IN THE STATES I DON'T THINK PHYSICS MASTERS DEGREES ARE VERY COMMON BUT TEXTBOOKS ARE PLENTIFUL AND YOU CAN GO PRETTY FAR WITHOUT FORMAL GUIDANCE IF YOU'RE WILLING TO WORK THROUGH PROBLEMS ON YOUR OWN
SKIPPING A BACHELOR'S IS ABSOLUTELY NOT AN OPTION ONLY IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A BACHELOR'S IN MATHEMATICS OR SOME FORM OF ENGINEERING WOULD THAT BE POSSIBLE ANYTHING YOU DO IN GRAD SCHOOL DIRECTLY BUILDS UPON WHAT YOU LEARN IN UNDERGRAD THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE OR SKIPPING THAT CAN BE DONE
PHYSICS MASTER'S DEGREES ARE TYPICALLY NOT OFFERED IN THE U SOUTH BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PROFESSIONAL DEGREE THAT LEADS TO ANY PARTICULAR CAREER YOU TYPICALLY APPLY DIRECTLY TO PHYSICS PHD PROGRAMS AFTER A BACHELOR'S AND PHS ARE RESEARCH DEGREES MOST PHYSICS JOBS REQUIRE A PHYSICS PHD
LOL
BUY A BOOK ON THE PHYSICS GRE CRY SOME THEN GO DO SOMETHING USEFUL WITH YOUR LIFE INSTEAD OF ALL THIS THEORETICAL BULL HOCKEY
I AGREE WITH MANY OTHER REPLIES THAT YOU WOULD NEED A B SOUTH IN SOMETHING MORE CLOSELY RELATED TO PHYSICS MATH CHEMISTRY ENGINEERING ETC IF THAT'S REALLY WHAT YOU WANT TO DO

NOTE THAT IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND ANY PROGRAM THAT WOULD CONSIDER ACCEPTING YOU WITH A BUSINESS DEGREE IF YOU REALLY THINK YOU WANT TO GIVE IT A TRY IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL BUT KNOW THAT IF YOU TAKE PHYSICS SERIOUSLY AS ONE OF THE OTHER POSTERS STATED IT'LL BE AT LEAST YEARS OF SCHOOL SOURCE I JUST DEFENDED MY PH D AND HAVE BEEN IN COLLEGE FOR YEARS I AM NOT UNIQUE

IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GIVE GRAD APPLICATIONS A TRY NOTE THAT YOU'LL NEED THE GENERAL GRE THEN THE PHYSICS SUBJECT GRE TAKE A GANDER AT THIS BOOK FOR SOME PHYSICS SUBJECT TEST PREPARATION NOTE THAT TO APPLY THERE WILL ALSO BE APPLICATION FEES GENERALLY TRANSCRIPT FEES GENERALLY FREE AND YOU'LL HAVE TO FIND PEOPLE THAT CAN WRITE VERY STRONG LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION FOR YOU

TL R IF YOU REALLY WANT TO PURSUE GRADUATE PHYSICS GET A B SOUTH IN PHYSICS FIRST AND PLAN TO DEDICATE AT LEAST THE NEXT DECADE EXCLUSIVELY TO YOUR STUDIES
RECENTLY FINISHED MY PHYSICS PHD AT A TOP RESEARCH UNIVERSITY FWIW

AS OTHERS HAVE SAID IN THE US MASTERS MEANS YOU DIDN'T FINISH A PHD PROGRAM NO STANDALONE MASTERS FOR PHYSICS THERE IS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MATERIAL AND ABSORBING IT TAKES TIME UNLESS YOU ASSUME THAT YOU ARE SIGNIFICANTLY SMARTER THAN THE PEOPLE WHO ARE STUDYING PHYSICS THE QUESTIONS YOU ARE ASKING AFTER A COUPLE YEARS ARE GOING TO BE THE QUESTIONS THAT EVERY PHYSICIST HAS THOUGHT OF AND LEARNED ABOUT ALREADY IF YOU WANT TO ASK NEW QUESTIONS YOU HAVE TO GO DEEP DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE

THAT SAID THE FEYNMAN LECTURES ON PHYSICS THREE BOOK SERIES ARE A PRETTY GOOD PLACE TO START IF YOU'RE DEAD SET ON GOING INTO THE DEEPER END OF THE POOL GOOGLE KIP APPLICATIONS OF CLASSICAL PHYSICS THIS IS A PRETTY COOL TEXTBOOK FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN IT THAT WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE TEXTBOOK FOR A MASTER'S LEVEL COURSE IN PHYSICS SHOULD THAT EXIST
VERY CHARMING INDEED PRINCE
MS SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH

I'VE ALREADY ADVANCED ON SOME OF YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS BEEN STUDYING BY MYSELF FOR THE PAST YEARS AND I'M STILL SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING THIS IDEA SO EVERY TIP IS EXTREMELY WELCOMED PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE ON RECOMMENDING HOW TO GO ON

AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TAKING THE TIME AND MANY CONGRATS FOR YOUR PHD
SUPER COOL WHAT A SMALL BIT OF OIL CAN DO TO A LAKE
VERY INTERESTING ONE NITPICK THAT LOOKS LIKE AT LEAST AN EIGHTH OF A CUP 2 TABLESPOONS AND OTHER ISSUE WATER IS POLAR AND FLUID WHY CAN IT BE SAID THE NEGATIVE HEAD OF THE OIL IS ATTRACTED TO THE POSITIVE SIDE WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE NEGATIVE POLE OF THE WATER MOLECULES THEN IT DOESN'T SEEM NECESSARY TO COME UP WITH THIS REASON FOR THE SPREADING OF THE OIL
YOU CAN DO IT IT'S ACTUALLY A REALLY COOL LOOKING INTRICATE PATTERN AND CHECKS OUT WITH ALL OBSERVATION THE THING THAT IT DOESN'T OFFER IS AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY THAT PATTERN HAPPENS AND HINGES ON THE AXIOM THAT THE EARTH IS THE CENTER OF EVERYTHING THE TRIUMPH OF THE KEPLERIAN MODEL IS THAT REMOVING THIS ASSUMPTION ALLOWS OBSERVATIONS TO BE MATCHED BY A MUCH SIMPLER MATHEMATICAL MODEL THAT NEWTON WOULD SOON GO TO SHOW COULD BE EXPLAINED BY GRAVITY NOT ONLY WAS IT A SIMPLER AND MORE ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF REALITY BUT IT ALSO GOT US OVER THE IDEA THAT EARTH IS THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE AND THAT EVERYTHING IS THE UNIVERSE WAS PERFECT I EAST PTOLEMY HELIOCENTRIC DESCRIPTION USING PERFECT CIRCLES WHICH HAS BEEN LIBERATING AS FAR AS OUR ABILITY TO DESCRIBE REALITY


A PICTURE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM MECHANICS USING EARTH AS THE CENTER
WIKI MEDIA FILE


ARE YOU ASKING IF EGOCENTRISM COULD ACTUALLY BE RIGHT OR WHY COPERNICUS WAS BETTER THAN PTOLEMY
PTOLEMY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT GRAVITY IT WOULD BE MINDBOGGLINGLY COMPLICATED TO DEVISE A MODEL WHERE EVERYTHING REVOLVES AROUND EARTH AND ACCOUNTS FOR GRAVITY LET ALONE ALL THE OBSERVATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE OUTSIDE THE SOLAR ARM I MEAN
I'LL START WITH QUESTION 2 IN FACT NO PARTICLE MASSES CAN BE CALCULATED IN THE STANDARD MODEL SM THE PARTICULAR AFT THAT DESCRIBES THE UNIVERSE AT LOW ENERGIES THE MASSES OF ALL THE SM MATTER PARTICLES ARE INPUT PARAMETERS WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE TO BE MEASURED EXPERIMENTALLY AND PLUGGED INTO THE EQUATIONS WHAT CAN BE OCCASIONALLY BE DONE IS CALCULATING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE MASSES OF THE VARIOUS PARTICLES THAT SHOULD BE OBEYED IF THE SM IS THE RIGHT THEORY

THE FIRST QUESTION IS A LITTLE MORE INVOLVED FOR STARTERS I'LL DESCRIBE THE PROTON IT IS A BASIC FACT THAT THE PROTON IS A BOUND STATE OF THREE QUARKS I EAST INSIDE THE PROTON THERE ARE THREE PHYSICAL QUARKS PLUS SOME OTHER STUFF IT IS VERY NATURAL TO ASK IF THE MASS OF THE PROTON CORRESPONDS TO THE MASS OF THESE THREE QUARKS THE ANSWER IS A RESOUNDING NUMBER SETTING ASIDE QUESTIONS OF HOW TO DEFINE THE MASSES OF THESE LIGHT QUARKS THE SUMMED MASSES OF TWO UP QUARKS AND ONE DOWN QUARK AMOUNTS TO ABOUT A FEW PERCENT OF THE PROTON'S MASSACHUSETTS THE REST COMES FROM A DIFFERENT SOURCE NAMELY THE STUFF HOLDING THE THREE QUARKS TOGETHER THE STRONG FORCE IS HOLDING THE PROTON TOGETHER I EAST PREVENTING THE THREES QUARKS FROM FLYING OFF TOGETHER THIS CONFIGURATION OF QUARKS AND GLUONS THE THINGS THAT CARRY THE STRONG FORCE HAS SOME POTENTIAL ENERGY BECAUSE E MC 2 THIS POTENTIAL ENERGY IS THE SAME AS A MASS THE MASS OF THE PROTON IN THE SAME WAY THAT A STRETCHED SPRING WEIGHS MORE THAN A RELAXED ONE THE POTENTIAL ENERGY OF THIS SYSTEM ADDS TO THE MASSES OF THE QUARKS TO GIVE THE MASS OF THE PROTON

THIS VERY PRETTY PHYSICAL PICTURE IS EMPHATICALLY NOT WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE HIGGS WHICH IS A MUCH SUBTLER AND QUANTUM PHENOMENON BEFORE EXPLAINING EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING I'D LIKE TO FIRST DISCUSS WHY EXACTLY IT'S SUCH A SUBTLE QUESTION IF WE NEGLECT QUANTUM MECHANICS THE SM BECOMES A CLASSICAL FIELD THEORY VERY SIMILAR TO BUT MORE COMPLICATED THEN CLASSICAL ELECTRODYNAMICS MATHEMATICALLY THIS AMOUNTS TO A COMPLICATED SET OF PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS WHOSE INPUT PARAMETERS EFFECT THE ALMOST ALWAYS APPROXIMATE SOLUTION IN CONTROLLED MANNERS

ONCE WE TURN QUANTUM MECHANICS BACK ON WE HAVE A MUCH MORE COMPLICATED BEAST A FULL INTERACTING QUANTUM FIELD THEORY LIKE THE SM IS AN INCREDIBLY INTRICATE OBJECT ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS STRONGLY COUPLED ONE OF THE CENTRAL QUESTIONS OF AFT IS HOW THE AFT IS RELATED TO ITS CLASSICAL LIMIT FOR THE PURPOSES OF YOUR QUESTION WHAT WE ARE INTERESTED IN IS HOW THE PARAMETERS THAT CONTROL SOLUTIONS TO THE QUANTUM THEORY THINGS LIKE PARTICLE MASSES ARE RELATED TO THOSE THAT CONTROL THE CLASSICAL THEORY THIS IS A TREMENDOUSLY DIFFICULT QUESTION IN GENERAL INDEED WE CAN ONLY RIGOROUSLY DEFINE THE VERY SIMPLEST EFTS FOR THEORIES LIKE THE SM THE BEST WE CAN DO IS DEFINE THEM THROUGH A LONG SERIES OF HACKS

FOR OUR PURPOSES WE'D LIKE TO ASK HOW IS THE QUANTUM HIGGS MASS RELATED TO THE CLASSICAL HIGGS MASS ON A PRACTICAL LEVEL THIS QUESTION IS ANSWERED IN PERTURBATION THEORY IN WHICH WE BASICALLY EXPAND THE QUANTUM THEORY IN A TAYLOR SERIES AROUND THE CLASSICAL THEORY THEN THE QUANTUM HIGGS MASS IS EQUAL TO THE CLASSICAL VALUE PLUS A BUNCH OF CORRECTIONS THAT ARE PROPORTIONAL TO POWERS OF BAR SO WE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE QUANTUM MASS SQUARED CLASSICAL MASS SQUARED SOMETHING BAR SOMETHING ELSE BAR 2 IN PRINCIPLE THE HIGGS MASS I EAST WHAT YOU MEASURE IN AN EXPERIMENT IS EQUAL TO THIS SUM

ASIDE THE HIERARCHY PROBLEM IN THIS GUISE IS THE FACT THAT THE COEFFICIENT OF BAR 2 IS INFINITY 2 THIS IS QUITE GENERIC IN MOST ANY PERTURBATION SERIES IN AFT THE COEFFICIENTS ARE EITHER OR INFINITY BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY INFINITIES WE'VE HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM WHAT STARTED AS A CHEAP TRICK TO GET AROUND AN INFINITY IN AN EQUATION HAS DEVELOPED INTO THE RICH AND BEAUTIFUL THEORY OF THE RENORMALIZATION GROUP THE RG HAS YIELDED PROFOUND AND DEEP INSIGHTS TO MANY AREAS IN PHYSICS FROM PARTICLE PHYSICS TO CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS HOWEVER THE TYPE OF INFINITY IN THE HIGGS MASS SQUARED CALLED A QUADRATIC DIVERGENCE BECAUSE IT GOES AS INFINITY SQUARED IS PARTICULARLY IRRITATING THIS IS THE HIERARCHY PROBLEM AND ATTEMPTS TO SOLVE IT HAVE LEAD TO VERY MANY NEW IDEAS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS

SO DOES THE HIGGS MASS DEPEND ON ITS INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER PARTICLES THE ANSWER DEPENDS ON WHAT EXACTLY YOU MEAN BY THE HIGGS MASSACHUSETTS IF YOU MEAN THE CLASSICAL VALUE THEN THE ANSWER IS NUMBER IF INSTEAD YOU MEAN THE MASS THAT'S MEASURED IN PARTICLE COLLIDES I EAST WHAT I'VE CALLED THE QUANTUM MASS THEN THE ANSWER IS YES YOU CAN REPEAT THE SAME STORY ABOVE FOR ANY PARTICLE YOU'D LIKE AND THEY'D ALL PICK UP HIGHER ORDER CORRECTIONS TO THEIR MASSES FROM INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER PARTICLES THE REASON THAT IT'S USUALLY ONLY EMPHASIZED FOR THE HIGGS IS THE HIERARCHY PROBLEM I DISCUSSED ABOVE

HOPEFULLY THIS IS HELPFUL FEEL FREE TO ASK ANY FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE
START WRITING STRAIGHT AWAY WRITE A COUPLE OF LINES ON EVERYTHING YOU READ EVEN IF YOU THINK IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY RELEVANT AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT YOUR WRITING NOT BEING WONDERFUL ON FIRST DRAFT YOU'LL BE REWRITING THAT THING AT LEAST A COUPLE OF TIMES

GOOGLE SCHOLAR IS YOUR FRIEND IT'S GREAT FOR FINDING CITATIONS ETC ALSO CHECK OUT MENDELEEV IT ORGANISES YOUR RESEARCH PAPERS AND HELPS WITH REFERENCING GOOD LUCK

EDIT A WORD
ONE THING THAT HAS WORKED WELL FOR ME IS TO START WITH A SMALL COLLECTION OF VERY WELL FOCUSED PAPERS AND BRANCH OUT FROM THE REFERENCES LOOK UP THE PAPERS THOSE PAPERS REFERENCE AS WELL AS THOSE AUTHORS OTHER WORKS THIS HELPS YOU GO BACKWARDS AND FIND THE ROOTS OF YOUR PROBLEM THEN START SEARCHING FOR PAPERS THAT CITE THOSE SEMINAL PAPERS AS WELL AS THE MORE CURRENT STUFF THIS IS A GOOD WAY TO GET TO THE BLEEDING EDGE OF THE FIELD
MENDELEEV FOR SURE AND IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF LATEX WHICH I HOPE TO GOD YOU HAVE GET ON THAT ASAP ACTUALLY WRITING I CAN'T HELP MUCH WITH AS I HAVEN'T DONE ONE MYSELF
I WAS A CHEMICAL ENGINEERING GRAD BUT HAD TO WRITE LIT REVIEWS THROUGHOUT GRAD SCHOOL FOR MY OWN RESEARCH AND WHEN I WAS ASKED TO REVIEW OTHER PAPERS

HERE'S SOMETHING TOTALLY CORNY THAT WORKED FOR ME A MIND MAP I WOULD ACTUALLY DRAW OUT ON A LARGE OR PAPER STARTING FROM A CENTRAL THEME HOW ONE IDEA LEAD TO ANOTHER WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT BRANCHES UNDER EACH IDEA I WOULD HAVE A SYMBOL LINKING TO THE PAPER I CAME UP WITH ELABORATE LEGEND KEY SYSTEMS YOU WOULD ONLY LAUGH AT THIS WAY IF I WANTED TO PURSUE A CERTAIN RESEARCH DIRECTION I HAD A GENERAL SENSE OF HOW THINGS LOOKED I STILL HAVE THEM A DECADE OR SO LATER

TRACKING REFERENCES IN THAT MIND MAP HAS NOW BEEN OBVIATED WITH THE MILLION SOFTWARE THAT EXIST BUT IT WAS GOOD TO ACTUALLY WRITE IT DOWN THE HARD PART ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE WRITING YOUR PAPER THESIS OR SOMETHING WAS NOT KNOWING SOME OBSCURE CACTOID ABOUT YOUR RESEARCH THAT YOU NOW KNOW IS OBVIOUS AFTER YEARS OF USING IT BUT TO KNOW WHAT'S A GOOD PAPER TO ACTUALLY REFERENCE IT AGAINST

AND LIKE THE OTHER PERSON SAID WRITE WRITE WRITE LIT REVIEWS CAN BE NUMBING AT TIMES AND WHEN YOU WRITE YOU HAVE SOME SEMBLANCE OF PROGRESS INSTEAD OF READING PAPERS AND GOING NOW I KNOW ALL THESE THINGS BUT I HAVE TO ACTUALLY START NOW

ALL THE BEST

PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICS BY HALEDAY RESNICK

DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING AGAINST USING GRIFFITHS
ANY INCREASED LENGTH ON THE STRINGS DUE TO THERMAL EXPANSION WILL REDUCE THE ELASTIC RESPONSE OF THE SHUTTLE COCK AGAINST THE STRINGS IT'S POSSIBLE THAT SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL THERMAL ENERGY MAY BE TRANSFERRED TO THE SHUTTLE COCK AT THE POINT OF IMPACT BUT WITH THE TENSION OF THE STRINGS DISTRIBUTED ACROSS ALL STRINGS THE ADDITIONAL ENERGY TRANSFER WOULD BE MINUTE COMPARED TO THE LOSSES INCURRED ACROSS ALL STRINGS
I KNOW THAT THE PREPRINT PAPER YOU MENTIONED ARXIV WAS PUBLISHED IN PHYSICAL REVIEW D AND WAS REVIEWED BY ASTROPHYSICS PROFESSOR BRIAN KOBERLEIN HERE IT WAS ALSO CITED BY OTHER LATER PAPERS SEE HERE IT WAS ALSO REVIEWED HERE THAT'S ALL I KNOW ABOUT IT I HOPE OTHERS HAVE MORE INFORMATION

AS FAR AS WHAT SOME MORE RECENT WORK IS EARLIER IN STEFFEN SIELEN AND NEIL HUROK WROTE A PAPER ABOUT A BOUNCE MODEL WHERE THE UNIVERSE PASSES THROUGH A BIG SINGULARITY SEE THERE'S A VIDEO OF A PRESENTATION ABOUT IT AT

THERE'S ALSO NEW WORK ON HOW SPACE-TIME MIGHT ARISE OUT OF QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT FOR EXAMPLE SEE

THERE'S PROBABLY A LOT OF OTHER RECENT WORK GOING ON ABOUT THIS TOPIC BUT OFF-HAND THE ABOVE ARE THINGS THAT I'VE READ ABOUT RECENTLY AGAIN I HOPE OTHERS HAVE MORE INFO TO SHARE






MATHEMATICIANS ARE FLUMMOXED

I HAVE A FEELING A MATHEMATICIAN MIGHT CHARACTERIZE THE SITUATION A BIT DIFFERENTLY

THE ANSWER LIES IN THE REGIME OF PHYSICS RATHER THAN MATHEMATICS

I THOUGHT PHYSICS WAS JUST APPLIED MATHEMATICS

NEURAL NETWORKS CAN BE EXPRESSED IN PURE MATHEMATICAL TERMS AND DON'T HAVE TO BE MODELLING ANY PHYSICAL PHENOMENON SO SAYING THAT THE EXPLANATION FOR THEM IS IN PHYSICS SEEMS LIKE A PHYSICIST FALLING PREY TO ANY SPECIALIST'S NATURAL PREDILECTION FOR RELATING EVERYTHING TO THEIR SPECIALTY

THERE CAN BE POSSIBLE IMAGES AND FOR EACH ONE IT IS NECESSARY TO COMPUTE WHETHER IT SHOWS A CAT OR DOG AND YET NEURAL NETWORKS WITH MERELY THOUSANDS OR MILLIONS OF PARAMETERS SOMEHOW MANAGE THIS CLASSIFICATION TASK WITH EASE

THIS IS NOT A FAIR CHARACTERIZATION EACH OF THE PARAMETERS IN A NEURAL NETWORK IS APPLIED TO EACH ELEMENT OF AN INPUT LEADING TO A COMBINATORIAL RELATION THAT IN FACT IS WHY IT WORKS

A PICTURE COULD REPRESENT AN ESSENTIALLY UNLIMITED NUMBER OF THINGS YET IS ONLY MADE OF A FEW MILLION ELEMENTS THIS IS NOT A DEEP INSIGHT

IF I WERE GOING TO RELATE NEURAL NETWORKS TO PHYSICS I WOULD PROBABLY NOMINATE THE HOLOGRAPHIC PRINCIPLE IF YOU MAKE A HOLOGRAM OF A SCENE AND THEN COVER ANY HALF OF IT UP YOU STILL SEE THE ENTIRE SCENE WITH HALF THE RESOLUTION THUS IT'S CLEAR THAT ALL THE INFORMATION PRESENT IS SPREAD OUT ACROSS THE INDIVIDUAL ELEMENTS BUT INSPECTING ANY ELEMENT DOESN'T REVEAL ANYTHING INTERESTING IF YOU LOOK AT EVEN A SMALL FRACTION OF THE ELEMENTS THOUGH YOU CAN STILL MAKE OUT A THREE-DIMENSIONAL SCENE FROM AN ESSENTIALLY UNLIMITED NUMBER OF ANGLES FAR MORE THAN ONE MIGHT NAIVELY EXPECT TO BE ENCODED IN SUCH A SMALL AMOUNT OF INFORMATION

NOT SURPRISED AT ALL TO SEE THE PAPER RELATE THIS TOPIC PARTICULARLY LAYERING TO RENORMALIZATION GROUP PROCEDURES WHICH WOULD CLEARLY HAVE RELEVANCE WHEN IT COMES TO DESCRIBING THE SAME DATA AT DIFFERENT SCALES AND RELATING THE PARAMETERS THAT DESCRIBE IT AT EACH SCALE THE EXPLORATION CONCLUSION THAT LAYERED NETWORKS CANNOT BE ACCURATELY APPROXIMATED BY FLAT NETWORKS SEEMS TO BE BEGGING THE SUGGESTION THAT ANALYZING WHAT THE DATA LOOKS LIKE AT DIFFERENT SCALES IS INTEGRAL TO DECIPHERING WHAT LAWS FUNCTIONS GOVERN THE DATA

VERY COOL PAPER
THIS IS THE BEST TL R I COULD MAKE ORIGINAL REDUCED BY I'M A BOT

WHEN IT COMES TO CLASSIFYING IMAGES OF CATS AND DOGS THE NEURAL NETWORK MUST IMPLEMENT A FUNCTION THAT TAKES AS AN INPUT A MILLION GRAYSCALE PIXELS AND OUTPUTS THE PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION OF WHAT IT MIGHT REPRESENT

THIS IS WHY THE STRUCTURE OF NEURAL NETWORKS IS IMPORTANT TOO THE LAYERS IN THESE NETWORKS CAN APPROXIMATE EACH STEP IN THE CAUSAL SEQUENCE

WE HAVE SHOWN THAT THE SUCCESS OF DEEP AND CHEAP LEARNING DEPENDS NOT ONLY ON MATHEMATICS BUT ALSO ON PHYSICS WHICH FAVORS CERTAIN CLASSES OF EXCEPTIONALLY SIMPLE PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS THAT DEEP LEARNING IS UNIQUELY SUITED TO MODEL CONCLUDE LIN AND TELEMARK

A SIMPLE EXPERIMENT TO SETUP TO GAIN EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH SDR DATA USE IT TO TUNE TO A KNOWN SATELLITE PASSING OVERHEAD WEATHER SATELLITES ARE COMMON AND USE FREQUENCIES THAT ANY SHOULD BE ABLE TO RECEIVE AND AS IT PASSES OVERHEAD RECORD THE POWER SPECTRUM ACROSS THE BAND VS TIME YOU WILL SEE THE SIGNAL SHIFTS IN FREQUENCY AS IT PASSES OVERHEAD THIS IS THE DOPPLER SHIFT USING THE DELTA IN FREQUENCY AND A LITTLE MATH SHOULD SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW FAST THE SATELLITE WAS MOVING RELATIVE TO YOU TRY AND FIGURE IT OUT AND THEN COMPARE WITH THE LISTED ORBITAL VELOCITY OF THE SATELLITE IN A CATALOG TRACKING PROGRAM SEE HOW CLOSE YOU GET

ALSO YOU CAN ACTUALLY DECODE NOAA WEATHER SATELLITE SIGNALS YOURSELF TO GET THE PICTURES FROM THE SATELLITE BUT YOU WILL NEED A TUNED CIRCULARLY POLARIZED ANTENNA TO RECEIVE THEM STRONG ENOUGH TO DECODE THE DATA ONE CAN BE MADE INEXPENSIVELY OUT OF COAX AND SOME PVC PIPE I'LL LET YOU PONDER ON WHY THE ANTENNA NEEDS TO BE CIRCULARLY POLARIZED
JUST A NOTE IF YOU GO INTO PHYSICS FOR NUCLEAR FUSION YOU WILL PROBABLY BE STUDYING PLASMA PHYSICS SO I'VE LISTED SOME USEFUL BOOKS ANOTHER ROUTE FOR SUPPORTING NUCLEAR FUSION RESEARCH IS MATERIAL SCIENCE BECAUSE THE INTERACTIONS ARE IMPORTANT FOR FUSION ENERGY ANOTHER APPROACH IS CONDENSED MATTER RESEARCH SPECIFICALLY INTO SUPERCONDUCTORS IN MY UNCREATIVE MIND BUT I'M SURE THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO SUPPORT FUSION WORK BECAUSE YOU NEED TO CONFINE THAT SHIT THERE ARE PROBABLY A LOT MORE WAYS TO SUPPORT FUSION RESEARCH SO DON'T THIS AS THE FINAL WORD

NOTE THIS LAST BOOK BY FOLIO WINTERBERG CONTAINS SOME OF THE MOST DIFFICULT MATHEMATICS PERHAPS SOMETHING THAT A JUNIOR IN MATH MIGHT NOT MIND BUT CONTAINS AN EXTRAORDINARY WEALTH OF NEW FUSION IDEAS SOMETHING THAT OLD GUARD FUSIONEERS WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN THE HANDS OF THE YOUNG

MATHEMATICS IS THE PORTAL TO ADVANCED SKILLS IN FUSION PHYSICS AND NUCLEAR ENGINEERING IT IS NOT REALLY POSSIBLE TO FIND A PROFESSIONAL FIRST POSITION IN THE FUSION FIELD WITHOUT A HIGH LEVEL OF MATHEMATICS COMPETENCY

FOR THOSE THAT HAVE ALREADY HAD TWO YEARS OF COLLEGE CALCULUS I WOULD RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING BOOK IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN A CAREER IN FUSION

FUSION FROM THE ENGINEERING SIDE PERHAPS DOES NOT GET AS MUCH PUBLICITY BUT MANY FUSION JOBS IN FUNDED PROJECTS HAVE A LOT OF ENGINEERING CONTENTION IT MAY ACTUALLY BE EASIER TO GET YOUR FIRST POSITION IF YOU HAVE A MATH OR ENGINEERING FOCUS ONLY SO MANY PHYSICS PROFESSIONALS GET HIRED EVEN IN REALLY LARGE FUSION PROGRAMS



FOLKS OVER AT R GETMOTIVATED MIGHT LIKE THIS TOO
I'M CONFUSED I THOUGHT GRAD SCHOOL WAS A COMBINATION OF A MSC AND A PHD BUT YOU SAID YOU DEFENDED YOUR MASTER'S
I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING YOU SAY EXCEPT I'M SURPRISED BY CLASSES MATTER IN SO FAR AS YOU PASS IN MY EXPERIENCE IN AN MS PROGRAM I WAS REPEATEDLY TOLD BY FACULTY AND PEERS THAT IN GRAD SCHOOL AN A IS AN A A B IS A C AND A C IS AN FOLIO THIS MAY HAVE BEEN MORE RELATED TO GRANTS C STUDENTS MIGHT LOSE FUNDING BUT I FOUND GRAD SCHOOL GRADE PRESSURE TO BE MUCH MORE STRICT THAN UNDERGRAD EVEN AT THE SAME INSTITUTION

MUCH APPRECIATED GOOD TO KNOW ABOUT THE SUBSTITUTIONS
READING STUFF LIKE THIS MAKES ME SAD I DIDN'T STICK WITH PHYSICS OR ME DON'T GET ME WRONG I LOVE COMPUTER SCIENCE TOO BUT IT DOESN'T FEEL AS EXHILARATING RIGHT NOW ANYWAY I'M STILL AN UNDERGRAD HAHA

THANK YOU FOR THIS WHOLE POST BUT IN PARTICULAR FOR THAT PICTURE

WHAT IS THIS ALL ABBOUD
POOR LONG-FORGOTTEN DR AARDVARK
I HAVE LITTLE TO SAY ABOUT THE PAPER ITSELF I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS NEAT AND MILDLY SIGNIFICANT TO THE PHYSICS COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE
DOES THIS HAVE ANY RELEVANCE IN THE ACTUAL FINDING AND RECOGNITION OF SAID PHYSICIST'S PAPERS FOR EXAMPLE WOULD IT BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO YOUR RESEARCH VISIBILITY TO LEGALLY CHANGE YOUR NAME TO AABAHAD OR SOMETHING INSTEAD TO REACH THE TOP SPOT IN ALPHABETICAL SEARCHES
AID AND ABBOUD ARE LEBANESE FAMILY NAMES
THIS IS JUST THE BEST
MAYBE I'LL CHANGE MY LAST NAME TO AA

LAW NUMBER

THE LARGE HADRON GEV DIPHOTON BUMP REGISTERED AT LEAST ONE UNAMBIGUOUS CONCLUSION FOR PHYSICISTS THEY'D FOUND SOMETHING NEW

THIS IS WRONG NEARLY EVERY PHYSICIST EXPECTED IT TO BE A FLUCTUATION OR ERROR OF SOME KIND

OBSERVATIONS MADE DURING THE CURRENT RUN INDICATE AN EXCESS IN TSH SIGNALS RECORDED AT THE ATLAS EXPERIMENT

BOTH ATLAS AND CMS OBSERVED A FEW MORE EVENTS THAN EXPECTED BUT NOT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE SIGMA IN A NAIVE COMBINATION

THEY DEFINITELY DON'T MATCH WITH THE DIFFERENCE BEING SOMEWHERE AROUND A FACTOR OF TWO

AND DO NOT DIFFER BY A FACTOR OF 2 BUT TAKING THE RATIO OF OBSERVED TO EXPECTED EXCLUSION LIMIT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE ANYWAY

BUT THE DISCOVERY OF THE TSH PRODUCTION MODE WHETHER IT ALIGNS WITH THE STANDARD MODEL OR NOT IS ONE OF THE FEW REMAINING GOALS OF THE LOC

HIGGS
HIGGS MUONS
HIGGS BAAR IN MORE PRODUCTION MODES
HIGGS GAMMA
HIGGS OFFSHELL FOR THE DECAY WIDTH

D MUONS
I COULD CONTINUE THAT LIST FOR QUITE SOME TIME

AND THOSE ARE JUST THINGS NEVER SEEN BEFORE THERE ARE ALSO HUNDREDS OF OTHER MEASUREMENTS ONGOING
IN THE STANDARD MODEL GRAVITY IS SEEN AS ONE OF THE FOUR FUNDAMENTAL FORCES OF NATURE ALONG WITH THE STRONG WEAK NUCLEAR FORCES AND ELECTROMAGNETISM

SMALL CORRECTION THE STANDARD MODEL OF PARTICLE PHYSICS DOESN'T INCLUDE GRAVITY AT ALL HISTORICALLY GRAVITY HAS BEEN CONSIDERED A FUNDAMENTAL FORCE BECAUSE THERE WAS A GOOD CLASSICAL FIELD THEORY TO DESCRIBE GRAVITY

NOW LET'S BRING IN EINSTEIN HIS THEORY OF RELATIVITY TREATS GRAVITY AS AN ILLUSION

LET'S NOT CALL IT AN ILLUSION PER SE THE CURVATURE OF SPACETIME IS CONSIDERED AS ACTUALLY THERE HOWEVER THE INERTIAL MOTION OF OBJECTS THROUGH CURVED SPACE IS DIFFERENT FROM THE INERTIAL MOTION WE'D EXPECT OF OBJECTS THROUGH FLAT SPACE

A BETTER WAY TO PHRASE IT WOULD BE TO SAY THAT CLASSICAL GRAVITY CAN BE AS A FICTITIOUS FORCE LIKE THE CENTRIFUGAL FORCE WHICH IS NOT PRESENT IN ALL REFERENCE FRAMES AND VANISHES FOR LOCALLY INERTIAL FRAMES JUST AS THE CENTRIFUGAL FORCE VANISHES IN FRAMES THE CENTRIFUGAL FORCE IS FICTITIOUS BECAUSE IT ONLY APPEARS IN ROTATING REFERENCE FRAMES NOT IN INERTIAL ONES SIMILARLY THE DESCRIPTION OF GRAVITY AS FICTITIOUS WOULD BE BECAUSE IT ONLY APPEARS IN DISTANT REFERENCE FRAMES WHERE THE CURVATURE IS DIFFERENT NOTE THAT IT'S THE DESCRIPTION OF GRAVITY AS A FORCE AND NOT AS CURVATURE THAT IS FICTITIOUS NOT GRAVITY ITSELF NOR THE EFFECTS OF GRAVITY GRAVITY CERTAINLY EXISTS

SO THIS GOT ME THINKING IF ONE WAS TO TAKE EINSTEIN LITERALLY AND APPROACH GRAVITY AS BEING A TRUE ILLUSION THEN THE MISSING GRAVITON MAKES PERFECT SENSE SINCE IT WOULDN'T EXIST ANYWAY BUT THEN THIS COULD MEAN THAT THERE ARE ONLY THREE FUNDAMENTAL FORCES NOT FOUR AS AN ILLUSION GRAVITY WOULD NOT BE ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL FORCES RIGHT

NOT EXACTLY NUMBER GRAVITY THAT IS THE CURVATURE OF SPACETIME IS STILL A REAL AND FUNDAMENTAL THING HOWEVER THE DESCRIPTION OF GRAVITY AS A FORCE WOULD MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE DESCRIBED CLASSICAL FORCE OF GRAVITY IS A FICTITIOUS FORCE THAT DOESN'T EXIST WHEN YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE WARPING OF SPACETIME

THE LACK OF A GRAVITON WOULD SIMPLY MEAN THAT THE CURVATURE OF SPACE IS NOT QUANTIZED IT WOULD NOT IMPLY THAT GRAVITY ISN'T A REAL FORCE

GRAVITY CAN BE WELL DESCRIBED WITH EFFECTIVE QUANTUM FIELD THEORY AND REPRODUCES THE PREDICTIONS OF GENERAL RELATIVITY SO BOTH DESCRIPTIONS ARE ACCURATE ONE DESCRIBES GRAVITY AS A REAL FORCE IN A FLAT SPACETIME ONE DESCRIBES GRAVITY AS A FICTITIOUS FORCE IN A CURVED SPACETIME THESE TWO DIFFERENT APPROACHES CAN BASICALLY BE CONSIDERED EQUIVALENT WHETHER ONE OR THE OTHER IS THE RIGHT FUNDAMENTAL DESCRIPTION REMAINS AN OPEN QUESTION BUT NO MATTER WHICH ONE IS MORE FUNDAMENTAL THAT DOESN'T EXACTLY INVALIDATE THE OTHER AS IT WOULD JUST BE AN ALTERNATIVE DESCRIPTION

EFFECTIVE QUANTUM FIELD THEORIES OF GRAVITY STOP BEING PREDICTIVE AT HIGH ENERGIES AND SHORT DISTANCE SCALES GENERAL RELATIVITY AT THESE SCALES PREDICTS PHENOMENA SUCH AS SINGULARITIES WHICH ARE CONSIDERED TO BE LIKELY UNPHYSICAL AND JUST A MATHEMATICAL ARTIFACT THAT SIGNALS A BREAKDOWN OF THE THEORY NEITHER APPROACH SEEMS TERRIBLY PROMISING FOR DESCRIBING THE GRAVITATIONAL BEHAVIOR OF SYSTEMS UNDER THESE EXTREME CONDITIONS WHAT WE REALLY WANT IS A SUCCESSFUL ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF GRAVITY IN THIS PARAMETER RANGE WE WANT TO KNOW THE DETAILS ABOUT HOW SINGULARITIES ARE AVOIDED WE JUST DON'T HAVE A GREAT APPROACH FOR THAT YET

HOPE THAT HELPS
THE GRAVITON HAS ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM WITH GENERAL RELATIVITY IT WORKS JUST FINE WITH IT AND THEN WHY WOULD YOU CALL GRAVITY AN ILLUSION JUST BECAUSE IT CAN BE DESCRIBED AS A SPACETIME CURVATURE ELECTROMAGNETISM CAN BE DESCRIBED AS CURVATURE OF A LINE BUNDLE BUT YOU WOULDN'T CALL IT AN ILLUSION RIGHT IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT ONE DAY WE WILL FIND A DESCRIPTION OF GRAVITY THAT LOOKS LIKE THE GAUGE THEORIES WE HAVE FOR THE WEAK STRONG AND ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERACTIONS AND STILL CAN ON A BIG SCALE BE DESCRIBED BY SPACETIME CURVATURE THIS IS NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE
IT'S POSSIBLE TO UNITE GRAVITY WITH ELECTROMAGNETISM THROUGH THEORY THIS STRONGLY IMPLIES THAT GRAVITY AND ELECTROMAGNETISM MUST BE THE SAME KIND OF FORCE THIS MEANS THAT IF GRAVITY IS NOT A FUNDAMENTAL FORCE THEN ELECTROMAGNETISM IS ALSO NOT A FUNDAMENTAL FORCE
I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THE CORRECTIONS OTHERS HAVE PUT FORWARD

BUT TO ADDRESS YOUR MAIN QUESTION YES BUT MOST LIKELY NOT

IF GRAVITY IS NOT A FUNDAMENTAL FORCE IT MUST BE A DERIVATIVE FORCE OF SOMETHING ELSE

WICH BRINGS US TO THREE POSSIBILITIES

IT IS A DERIVATIVE OF SOME NEW UNKNOWN FORCE

IT IS THE DERIVATIVE OF ONE OR MORE OF THE TWO FORCES WE ALREADY HAVE

COMBINATION OF ONE OR MORE OF THE TWO FORCES WE ALREADY HAVE SOME UNKNOWN FORCE


IF IT IS THEN WE DIDN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING SUBSTANTIAL ADAMIK

IF IT IS 2 I THINK THE BEST CANDIDATE WOULD BE SOME LONG DISTANCE MECHANISM WITH THE HIGGS BUT CONSIDERING THAT IT IS MASSIVE IT WOULD BE IN A CONTRADICTION WITH THE SPEED OF GRAVITY

IF IT IS I AM HAVING A HARD TIME FIGURING OUT AN EXAMPLE TO DEMONSTRATE HOW IT COULD WORK BUT IT IS A MORE COMPLICATED VERSION OF 2



GOING BACK TO 2 WHETHER GRAVITY IS OR ISN'T A FUNDAMENTAL FORCE THE EFFECT WILL NEED TO BE PROPAGATED VIA A MASSLESS BOSON THE ONLY TWO MASSLESS BOSONS THAT WE KNOW OF ARE THE PHOTON AND THE GLUON ONE IS CONFINED AND ANOTHER HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH GRAVITY IT WOULD SEEM SOME NEW BOSON IS REQUIRED ANYWAY AND IN THIS CASE WE OVER COMPLICATED THE PHYSICS OF THE PROBLEM
IS IT POSSIBLE GRAVITY IS NOT A FUNDAMENTAL FORCE

GRAVITY IS NOT A FORCE AT ALL IT RESULTS FROM THE NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRY OF FOUR-DIMENSIONAL SPACETIME IT ONLY APPEARS TO BE A FORCE

NOW LET'S BRING IN EINSTEIN HIS THEORY OF RELATIVITY TREATS GRAVITY AS AN ILLUSION

NO EINSTEIN TREATS GRAVITY AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN SPACETIME AND MASSACHUSETTS HE DOESN'T REGARD IT AS AN ILLUSION UNLESS BY ILLUSION YOU MEAN AS AN ILLUSORY FORCE

SO THIS GOT ME THINKING IF ONE WAS TO TAKE EINSTEIN LITERALLY AND APPROACH GRAVITY AS BEING A TRUE ILLUSION

NOW YOUR ARGUMENT RELIES ON A FALSE PREMISE THAT EINSTEIN REGARDED GRAVITY AS AN ILLUSION

THE PROBLEM WITH GRAVITY IS THAT IT'S INCOMPATIBLE WITH QUANTUM THEORIES AND QUANTUM THEORIES ARE VERY WELL-SUPPORTED THIS IS AN UNSOLVED PROBLEM IN PHYSICS
YEAH BUT IT'S LIKE CLEARLY THERE JUMP OFF THE GROUND RIGHT NOW
I WOULD BET ARE YOU GOING TO TOUCH ON A THEORETICAL ANALYSIS AS WELL I KNOW IT MIGHT BE MUCH FOR HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL YOU COULD START OFF WITH STUDYING THE BOUNCE OF THE BALL WITHOUT WATER EITHER EMPIRICALLY OR THEORETICALLY BY USING THE ELASTIC DEFORMATION OF THE BALL AND THEN ADD THE WATER BACK IN ACCOUNT FOR DRAG FORCES AND WATER SURFACE TENSION
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU MEAN BY ESSAY IF YOU'RE WILLING TO DO A BUNCH OF MEASUREMENTS OF DROPPING THE BALL AT VARYING HEIGHTS BOTH WITH AND WITHOUT WATER AND THEN DISCUSS WHAT YOU'RE SEEING AND WHY IT'S HAPPENING PREFERABLY WITH A BIT OF MATH TO BACK UP YOUR STATEMENTS SEE THE GUY ABOVE ME THEN YOU PROBABLY HAVE SOMETHING

THIS SOUNDS LIKE IT'S PROBABLY AN ASSIGNMENT OF SOME SORT SO IT'S WORTH RUNNING THE IDEA BY THE TEACHER JUST TO CONFIRM ITS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE ASSIGNMENT
I THINK THE EFFECT WILL BE TO LOWER THE BOUNCE HEIGHT IF YOU DO END UP DONE THE EXPERIMENTS PLS POST THE DATA CURIOUS TO SEE THE RESULTS
REMINDME DAYS
PRETTY COOL I DID SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR TO THIS IN UNDERGRAD FOR RESEARCH IN PEROVSKITE HETEROSTRUCTURE

IS THERE A WAY TO SNAP TO A CERTAIN ENERGY LEVEL OR DO YOU JUST HAVE TO SLIDE THE BAR UNTIL YOU FIND A SMOOTH SOLUTION
WHY NOT JUST LET DIVERGE OFF ONE END IT'S MUCH MORE OBVIOUS THAN SEARCHING FOR A KINK
I REALLY LIKE THE IDEA AND IT LOOKS GREAT

I THINK THE PATTERN BETWEEN THE ENERGY EIGENVALUES FOR EACH POTENTIAL FUNCTION WOULD BE A LOT CLEARER IF THE BOTTOM OF EACH WELL WAS AT ZERO FOR EXAMPLE THE BOTTOM OF THE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR IS AT E AND THE BOTTOM OF THE INFINITE SQUARE WELL IS AT E WHICH IS SOMEWHAT

IT WOULD ALSO BE NICE IF YOU COULD INPUT DIFFERENT ENERGIES MANUALLY TO MAKE IT EASIER TO FIND THE ENERGY EIGENSTATE MORE PRECISELY

NEVERTHELESS GREAT WORK THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY NICE TO HAVE WHEN I WAS FIRST LEARNING THIS STUFF
I CANNOT DRAW THE POTENTIAL I AM USING FIREBOX
INTERNET EXPLORE IT WORKS
THAT'S CRAZY
JUST CURIOUS IS THERE A PHYSICAL REASON THAT THE KINK IS ALWAYS ON THE RIGHT RATHER THAN THE LEFT GIVEN THE SYMMETRY OR JUST IT HAD TO BE SOMEWHERE LOVE THE TOOL BY THE WAY VERY COOL
TOOLTIPS OVER THE ICONS OR A LEGEND WOULD HELP EXPLAIN WHAT THINGS ARE IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT PHI IS ALSO THE ROTATION SENSITIVITY IS TOO HIGH PERHAPS A HORIZONTAL SCROLLBAR WOULD GIVE MORE CONTROL
OKAY I'M IMPRESSED IT WAS COOL ENOUGH UNTIL I REALIZED I COULD DRAW MY OWN POTENTIAL
GREAT PLACE TO VISIT I GOT A AWESOME TOUR WHEN I INTERVIEWED THE HOLOMETER TEAM MOST OF IT IS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC
IF YOU LIVE NEARBY THEY OFFER SATURDAY MORNING LECTURES AIMED AT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM
PRETTY MUCH WHAT I EXPECTED NOT TO SAY IT ISN'T AWESOME JUST THAT SCI-FI DOES A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF IMITATING REAL LIFE PHYSICS

NONE OF THE IMAGES ARE LOADING FOR ME JUST HUGE BUSINESS INSIDER LOGOS
DID NOT EXPECT TO SEE MY PROJECT SUPERVISOR FROM LAST YEAR WHEN I CLICKED THIS LINK
VISITING FERMILAB WAS THE FIRST TIME I EVER ENCOUNTERED A BISON IN REAL LIFE UNFORTUNATELY I NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO TASTE THEM
THAT LAST ONE LOOKS LIKE A SCI-FI SET AWESOME
FERMILAB IS FREAKING AMAZING I WENT ON A TRIP THERE WITH MY PHYSICS DEPARTMENT IN UNDERGRAD THE COMPLEXITY OF ALL THE DETECTORS AND ACCELERATOR COMPONENTS WAS TOTALLY MIND-BOGGLING
CAME HERE FOR HAL QUOTES
THE PHOTOS WERE AWESOME MAYBE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE HORRIBLE HD ONES
LET ME KNOW WHEN WE GET SOME REAL IMAGES
I MEAN CHINA HAS A INFORMOUS MONEY CANNON THAT THEY WIELD WITH RECKLESS ABANDON THAT'S KIND OF WHERE THE US FAILED BUT APPARENTLY YANG IS THE NEW ANDERSON
YANG SAID EXISTING FACILITIES INCLUDING THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER CONTRIBUTED LITTLE TO THE INCREASE OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE AND WAS IRRELEVANT TO MOST PEOPLE S DAILY LIVES

BAH THE FIRST HALF OF THAT IS FALSE AND THE SECOND COULD BE SAID ABOUT ENTIRE CAREER WE DO FUNDAMENTAL PARTICLE PHYSICS BECAUSE WE AS A SPECIES WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE WORLD WE LIVE IN WE DON'T DO IT TO INCREASE OUR MATERIAL COMFORTS IF HE REALLY THINKS RESEARCH BEING IRRELEVANT TO MOST PEOPLE'S LIVES IS A PROBLEM HE'D HAVE DONE SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT WITH HIS LIFE

EDIT MORE SPECIFICITY SINCE SOME AREAS OF PHYSICS DO AIM TO IMPROVE OUR MATERIAL COMFORT
WOW IT'S ALMOST LIKE THIS GUY IS ENTITLED TO HIS OPINION IF THE PROJECT CAN'T SURVIVE ONE CRUSTY OLD CURMUDGEON PERHAPS THE WILL REALLY ISN'T THERE
ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST
DAMN FREE MESONS THEY HAVE THEIR HANDS IN EVERYTHING
OK SO WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS A HEAT ENGINE THERMODYNAMICS REQUIRES THAT FOR THIS TO WORK YOU MUST REJECT HEAT TO THE ENVIRONMENT THE THEORETICAL MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY FOR SUCH A PROCESS WOULD BE THE CARNOT EFFICIENCY ETA COLD HOT WHERE COLD IS THE TEMPERATURE YOU ARE REJECTING HEAT TO AND HOT IS THE TEMPERATURE YOU ARE EXTRACTING HEAT FROM

SO THAT'S THE MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY OF WASTE HEAT RECOVERY THAT YOU CAN GET OUT OF A SYSTEM ITS NOT SUPER FEASIBLE YET FOR SMALL ENGINES BUT THIS TYPE OF THING IS A BIG DEAL FOR POWER PLANTS THIS IS NOT TYPICALLY GOING TO ADD A LOT OF HEAT BACK INTO THE SYSTEM FOR A COUPLE REASONS WHEN SOURCES GENERATE HEAT OF HIGHER TEMPERATURE HIGHER TEMP HEAT IS GREATER QUALITY BETTER CARNOT EFFICIENCY AND GREATER FEASIBILITY HEAT IS USUALLY THE PRODUCT NOT AN UNDESIRABLE SO YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO SEE A DRAMATIC REDUCTION IN TEMPERATURE BEFORE YOUR UNIT STEPS IN 2 WHEN HEAT ISN'T THE PRODUCT ITS TYPICALLY LOWER TEMP WHICH MAKES IT VERY HARD TO EXTRACT WORK FROM AND TYPICALLY MONEY AVAILABLE FOR BETTER DESIGN WILL LIKELY BE GOING TO BETTER EFFICIENCY IN THE PRIMARY SYSTEM WHICH WILL LEAD TO AN EVEN LOWER TEMPERATURE

I UNDERSTAND THAT MY ANSWER MAY SEEM LIKE I MISSED THE POINT OF YOUR QUESTION AS I'M TALKING ABOUT WASTE HEAT RECOVERY RATHER THAN COOLING BUT ACTUALLY THERMODYNAMICALLY I PROMISE I DIDN'T

NOW THERE ARE HVAC SYSTEMS THAT ACT IN MUCH THE WAY YOU ARE HYPOTHESIZING THEY TAKE A ZONE WHICH REQUIRES COOLING LIKE A BIG SERVER ROOM AND USE IT TO HEAT ANOTHER ROOM THAT NEEDS HEATING THE TEMPERATURE RANGE CLIMATE NECESSARY FOR A BUILDING TO HAVE THIS REQUIREMENT IS FAIRLY NARROW BUT I HAPPEN TO LIVE IN AN AREA WHERE IT OCCASIONALLY IS THE CASE AND THE ENGINEERING FIRM I WORK FOR DID A PROJECT LIKE THIS A WHILE BACK NOW IN THAT CASE EFFICIENCY IS ACTUALLY QUITE HIGH BECAUSE THE WASTE HEAT ISN'T GOING INTO USABLE WORK ITS JUST BEING USED TO HEAT A ROOM WHICH IS A VERY EASY THING TO MAKE LOW QUALITY HEAT DO

ALSO MECHANICAL EXTRACTION OF LOW TEMPERATURE HEAT ISN'T THE ONLY OPTION THERE'S A LOT OF REALLY COOL ALTERNATIVES CHEMICAL STRAIGHT HEAT GRADIENT TO ELECTRICITY AND SOME POTENTIALLY EXOTIC ALTERNATIVES

SOME MORE INFO FOR YOU
I AM IN MY FIRST YEAR OF STUDYING PHYSICS IN HOPE OF GETTING INTO THE FIELD OF ASTRONOMY ASTROPHYSICS HOWEVER I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY SOME TEACHERS MY DEGREE IS CATERED FOR THE RESEARCH CONDUCTED AT MY UNIVERSITY WHICH DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY ASTROPHYSICS PROJECTS SO I AM WONDERING IF ANYONE IS ABLE TO TELL ME IF THE SUBJECTS I WILL DO OVER THE NEXT 2 YEARS ARE A GOOD RANGE OF SUBJECTS TO HELP ME GET INTO THE FIELD OF ASTROPHYSICS AND WILL THEY GIVE ME A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRINCIPLES I NEED TO KNOW OR SHOULD I MOVE TO A UNIVERSITY WITH MORE OF A FOCUS ON ASTROPHYSICS RATHER THAN JUST A GENERAL PHYSICS MAJOR
THE SUBJECTS ARE

I HAD A SKYPE INTERVIEW TODAY FOR ONE OF THE PHD POSITIONS I APPLIED FOR MY PRESENTATION AND INTERVIEW WENT WELL DESPITE SOME HINDRANCES

BUT DAMN YOU SKYPE AND DAMN YOU SHITTY INTERNET
I AM GETTING READY TO APPLY FOR GRAD SCHOOLS I HAVE MY TOP SCHOOLS I AM AIMING FOR BUT ITS THE REST THAT I NEED SUGGESTIONS FOR

I AM INTO MATHEMATICAL THEORETICAL PHYSICS BUT MOSTLY MATHEMATICAL AND I WANT TO KNOW IF ANYONE HAS SUGGESTIONS FOR UNIVERSITIES THAT MIGHT NOT BE BRAND NAME UNIVERSITIES LIKE CALTECH OR MIT WHICH STILL HAVE REALLY INTERESTING RESEARCH GROUPS I AM CURRENTLY AT STONY BROOK AND AM LOOKING FOR OTHER PLACES ALONG THOSE LINES

THE FINAL CATEGORY I AM LOOKING AT IS PHYSICS IN NICE PLACES IF I CANT GET INTO A GREAT PHYSICS UNIVERSITY MIGHT AS WELL BE SOMEWHERE BEAUTIFUL IF ANY OF YOU HAVE KNOW OF PHYSICS UNIVERSITIES IN REALLY NICE LOCATIONS LEMME HEAR ABOUT IT
HEY I HAVE A QUESTION FOR FELLOW PHYSICISTS WHO EITHER PICKED CAREER IN PROGRAMMING OR HAVE FRIENDS WHO DID

NEXT YEAR I WILL FINISH MY MASTERS DEGREE IN PHYSICS I'LL DO MY THESIS ON CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS WITH HEAVY QM ELEMENTS EVOLUTION OF CARRIERS IN SEMICONDUCTOR STRUCTURES BASICALLY HOWEVER I DON'T REALLY WANT TO REMAIN IN THE ACADEMIA INSTEAD I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING IN PROGRAMMING INDUSTRY I'M ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN TOPICS LIKE DEEP LEARNING AND DATA SCIENCE WHERE I COULD USE UNIQUE SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE I ACQUIRED DURING MY STUDIES I KNOW PYTHON AND C VERY WELL AS WELL AS JAVA C MATALAN FORTRAN ETC I WORKED WITH EXTENSIVE SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES TO PYTHON C AND FORTRAN

MY QUESTION IS AS A MPHPS WHAT SKILLS SHOULD I STILL GET TO FIND SATISFYING JOB WHERE TO LOOK FOR HIGH LEVEL PROGRAMMING JOBS WITHOUT ANY OFFICIAL EXPERIENCED IN PROGRAMMING EXCEPT CLASSES IN MY CURRICULUM OF COURSE HOW TO LOOK FOR INTERESTING COMPANIES I MIGHT HAVE NEVER HEARD BEFORE BOTH IN MY COUNTRY AND ABROAD WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST ADVANTAGES MPHPS WILL GIVE ME IN THE WORKPLACE AND HOW TO ADVERTISE THEM THANKS IN ADVANCE
Q WOULD AN BACHELORS IN ENGINEERING PHYSICS ADEQUATELY PREPARE ME FOR A PHD PROGRAM IN PHYSICS
I'M CURRENTLY IN A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL WHO IS CURRENTLY INTERESTED IN SOME KIND OF AEROSPACE PHYSICS CAREER RIGHT NOW I'M TAKING BC CALC AND AP PHYSICS AND 2 BUT WHERE SHOULD I GO AFTER THAT MY UNI OPTIONS RIGHT NOW ARE PRETTY MUCH ANY TEXAS SCHOOL SHOULD I BE LOOKING INTO SOME KIND OF INTERNSHIP PROGRAM TO GET AHEAD THANKS
I HAVE TWO SEMESTERS TO COMPLETE AND THEN I WILL GRADUATE WITH A BS IN PHYSICS I HAVE NO CONCENTRATION AND IT HAS TAKEN ME YEARS TO COMPLETE MY STUDIES I HAVE NO INTERNSHIPS AND BY THE TIME I GRADUATE I WILL HAVE ONLY COMPLETED ONE SEMESTER OF RESEARCH ON A SCALE OF TO EMPLOYABLE HOW FUCKED AM I
I SPOKE WITH THE GRADUATE ADVISOR TODAY AND HE TOLD ME THAT I SHOULDN'T WASTE MY TIME STUDYING TO RETAKE THE AGRE THIS OCTOBER AS MY OTHER BASE QUALIFICATIONS ALREADY PUT ME OVER MOST THRESHOLDS AGRE GRE GA

I THINK I COULD IMPROVE MY SCORE A BIT UP TO MY IDEAL SCORE SINCE I DIDN'T STUDY MUCH THE FIRST TIME AROUND BUT WOULD YOU GUYS AGREE THAT HE'S CORRECT HE SAYS I SHOULD JUST FOCUS ON MY RESEARCH AND STATEMENT S OF PURPOSE FROM NOW ON AS THEY WILL BE MY DISTINGUISHING FACTORS ONCE I'VE JUMPED THE HOOP WITH MY PREVIOUS CREDENTIALS AS OPPOSED TO AN EXTRA POINTS ON MY AGRE SCORE
I'M A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL FINISHING MY INTERNATIONAL BACCALAUREATE DIPLOMA AND I WAS WONDERING IF ANYONE KNEW IF THE NIELS BOHR INSTITUTE AT COPENHAGEN UNIVERSITY WAS A GOOD PLACE TO STUDY UNDERGRAD PHYSICS
I'M A RECENT GRADUATE WITH MY BS IN PHYSICS AND AM TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT SCHOOLS OFFER GRADUATE PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON GRAVITATIONAL PHYSICS SUCH AS GRAVITATIONAL WAVE ASTRONOMY WOULD ANYONE HERE HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO WHERE I SHOULD BE LOOKING
SINCE HE HAD TO TRADE HIS SHOES FOR A DIGITAL SCALE EXPECT TO SEE HIM NAKED WHEN HE COMES BACK WITH A LASER
PHOTONS OF LIGHT THEY CARRY ENERGY THEREFORE THEY CARRY MASS E MC 2

WE LIKE TO THINK THAT OUR CONTENT FITS THAT HAPPY MEDIUM WRITTEN BY PHYSICISTS FOR PHYSICISTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR SPECIALIZATION Z THE PRINT MAGAZINE INCLUDES THREE FEATURE ARTICLES THAT INCLUDE HISTORIES OF SPECIFIC EVENTS IN PHYSICS BROAD OVERVIEWS OF AN AREA OF PHYSICS AND DEEP BUT ACCESSIBLE DIVES INTO NARROWER AREAS OF PHYSICS THE REST OF THE MAGAZINE INCLUDES PIECES ABOUT POLICY FUNDING ISSUES AND VARIOUS EDUCATIONAL AND RESEARCH FACILITIES BOOK REVIEWS OBITUARIES SHORT LOOKS AT RECENT RESEARCH PUBLICATIONS AND A FEW OTHER ODDS AND ENDS


Z WITH OCCASIONAL EXCEPTION WOJCIECH ZUREK I'M LOOKING AT YOU HETP
WHAT FIELD DID YOU END UP IN IF I MAY ASK AND WHAT MOTIVATED THAT
THERE ARE SOME PRETTY GOOD PHYSICS BLOGS OUT THERE HERE ARE MY FAVORITES







IF YOU'RE KEEN I COULD GIVE YOU SOME SPECTRA TO FIT
EVERY DAY I READ THROUGH THE TITLES OF NEW NRL ARTICLES IF THEY ARE INTERESTING I READ THE ABSTRACT IF THEY ARE REALLY INTERESTING I SKIM THROUGH THE PAPER THIS DOESN'T GIVE ME SUPER KNOWLEDGE BUT IT DOES KEEP ME ABREAST OF WHAT'S GOING ON THE WORLD OF PHYSICS OUTSIDE MY AREA
I TOO SHARE YOUR SENTIMENT I CURRENTLY FIND EASE BY TUTORING AND TRYING TO LEARN NEW THINGS IN MY OWN IT HELPS WHEN I THINK OF A FUN PROJECT THAT REQUIRES ME TO LEARN
YOUTUBE CHANNELS REDDIN RELEVANT MAGAZINES AND TEARS
I GO OVER THE BASIC DERIVATIONS TO THE LIMIT OF MY ABILITIES I HAVE NOT WORKED FOR YEARS DUE TO DISABILITIES BUT CHALLENGE MY SELF TO GO OVER AND THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND THE DETAILS OF MODERN PHYSICS TO THE EXTENT I CAN SOLVE PROBLEMS IN THERMODYNAMICS CM QM I ALSO TRACE THE MOTIVATIONS AND METHODS OF THE GREATS ADDITIONALLY I CONTINUALLY FOLLOW AND DEVELOP MY KNOWLEDGE OF ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS NOT MY AREA S BECAUSE THIS AREA SYNTHESIZES A LOT OF ADVANCED BASIC KNOWLEDGE YOUR ARE PRIVILEGED TO HAVE A MODERN EDUCATION USE IT OR LOSE IR UNFORTUNATELY IT'S NOT LIKE RIDING A BIKE
THE INTERNET CAN BE USEFUL HERE

I LIKE TO FOLLOW PROJECTS BY THEIR PAPERS AND REPORTS AND I LOOK FOR A FEW WELL KNOWN NAMES

MY PRIMARY INTEREST IS VISION SO I DON'T GO DEEP DIVING AT CERN OR FIGO BUT THOSE PROJECTS SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD BY ALL PHYSICISTS

GOOD QUESTION
THANK YOU FOR ASKING THE QUESTION YEARS OUT AND I'VE BEEN WONDERING THE SAME
YOU'RE BEING DOWNVOTED BECAUSE THIS IS A SIMPLE QUESTION OF ENERGY CONSERVATION IF THE SAME POWER IS BEING DELIVERED ALL ELSE CONSIDERED EQUAL PERFECT ABSORPTION OF ENERGY OF THE ROOM NO WAY FOR ENERGY TO ESCAPE THE SYSTEM EXACTLY IS CONTINUOUSLY USED ETC ETC THEN THEY HAVE TO BE THE SAME
WHY COULD THE OBSERVED BEHAVIOR NOT BE CAUSED BY A BLACK HOLE OR OTHER SOURCE OF MASS WITH LOW OR UNDETECTABLE LIGHT EMISSION
IS IT THAT DARK MATTER AND BLACK HOLES ARE ONE AND THE SAME THING JUST WAY MORE COMMON VARIETY OF SIZES IN THE UNIVERSE THAN WE EVER SUSPECTED BEFORE OUR GRAVITATIONAL LENSING TECHNIQUES GOT GOOD ENOUGH TO SHOW IT
DELETED
OR THERE COULD BE DYSON SPHERES SWARMS IN THOSE REGIONS
REALLY COOL IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT A FORMAL DERIVATION AS YOU SAY YOURSELF BUT IT GIVES A NICE INTUITION FOR WHY THE TEMPERATURE IS EXACTLY WHAT IT IS
THE FIRST TIME I SAW THIS FROM LECTURE NOTES I BELIEVE I THOUGHT IT WAS THE COOLEST THING EVER
WAIT A SECOND ONE CAN EXTEND ANY METRIC TO IMAGINARY TIME AND IMPOSE THE SAME PERIODICITY CONDITION SO THAT WOULD MEAN THAT ANY SPACE-TIME HAS A TEMPERATURE WHICH OBVIOUSLY CANNOT BE THE CASE
HOT DAMN THIS IS INCREDIBLE I DON'T CARE IF IT'S NOT PERFECTLY RIGOROUS IT'S ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ARGUMENTS I'VE EVER SEEN
VERY COOL ESSAY I'VE NEVER HEARD OF LINKING TEMPERATURE TO IMAGINARY TIME BUT AFTER SEEING FACTOR AND TIME EVOLUTION NEXT TO EACH OTHER IT JUST CLICKED DUH
SOO WHERE THE FUCK IS MY ICE CREAM
I WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT I JUST READ HOWEVER THAT SIMPLY ISN'T THE CASE FASCINATING STUFF NONETHELESS
STRING THEORY ISN'T THE ONLY THING THEORETICAL PHYSICISTS ARE STUDYING YOU MIGHT GET THIS IMPRESSION FROM POPULAR SCIENCE SHOWS BUT THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT AREAS OF INTEREST THE UNIVERSITY I STUDY PHYSICS AT HAS AN OVERVIEW OF SOME OF THEIR RESEARCH HERE



IN ADDITION THEY STUDY COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE AND SOME COSMOLOGY NONE OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY STUDYING STRING THEORY

JOBS IN ASTROPHYSICS ARE PROBABLY OFTEN ACADEMIC OR TEACHING JOBS BUT I SUPPOSE IF YOU GET PROGRAMMING SKILLS YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO WORK IN THAT FIELD TOO FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD MANY THEORETICAL PHYSICISTS GET EMPLOYED AS ANALYSTS FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES AND BANKS HERE FINLAND
IT'S A BIG MISCONCEPTION THAT PHYSICISTS ONLY WORK ON STRING THEORY THAT'S A TINY MINORITY
FIRST OF ALL THEORETICAL PHYSICS ISN'T A FIELD RATHER THERE ARE FIELDS OF PHYSICS POLYMER PHYSICS STUDY OF PLASTICS AND POLYMERS THEIR PROPERTIES PHASE TRANSITIONS FORMATIONS ETC PLASMA PHYSICS STUDYING PLASMA EITHER FOR ASTROPHYSICS LIKE IN STARS OR FOR THINGS LIKE NUCLEAR FUSION OF MORE TECHNOLOGICALLY FOCUSED THINGS LIKE THE NANOTECHNOLOGY ETCHING THAT IS PART OF MANUFACTURING COMPUTER CHIPS LIKE THE KIND YOU'RE USING RIGHT NOW PARTICLE PHYSICS THIS IS WHAT YOU SEEM TO ASSOCIATE WITH PHYSICS A SMALL SUBSET WORK IN STRING THEORY GEOPHYSICS ACOUSTIC PHYSICS NUCLEAR PHYSICS ATOMIC MOLECULAR OPTICAL AMO PHYSICS CHEMICAL PHYSICS ASTROPHYSICS ETC IN QUITE THE OPPOSITE OF YOUR ASSUMPTION PARTICLE PHYSICS MAKES UP ONLY ABOUT OF PHYSICS AND OF THOSE AN EVEN TINIER FRACTION WORK ON THINGS LIKE STRING THEORY MAYBE 2 OF PHYSICISTS

IN REALITY THE BIGGEST FIELD OF PHYSICS IS CALLED CONDENSED MATTER THIS IS A VARIED FIELD THAT INCLUDES THINGS VERY CLOSE TO MODERN TECHNOLOGY LIKE AND TECHNOLOGY QUANTUM CASCADE LASERS GRAPHEME TRANSISTORS 2D MATERIALS CARBON NANOTUBES ETC TO MORE BLUE SKY THINGS LIKE SUPERCONDUCTORS EXOTIC PHASES OF MAGNETISM EXOTIC CONDENSATES ETC

WITHIN EACH DISCIPLINE A PHYSICIST THEN HAS MORE OR LESS INFEOF THREE THEORY EXPERIMENT OR COMPUTATION AND IN ASTRONOMY THERE'S OBSERVATIONALISTS SO NO ONE STUDIES THEORETICAL PHYSICS THAT'S SOMETHING HOLLYWOOD MADE UP BUT RATHER YOU MAY BE A THEORETICAL POLYMER PHYSICIST OR EXPERIMENTAL PARTICLE PHYSICIST OR COMPUTATIONAL CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICIST ETC

SO A CAREER IN PHYSICS INVOLVES PICKING A THEORY EXPERIMENT COMPUTATION AND A TOPIC PARTICLE CONDENSED MATTER QUANTUM INFORMATION ACOUSTIC ETC

AN EXPERIMENTAL CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICIST WITH A SPECIALIZATION IN EMERGING DEVICES IS WAY MORE EMPLOYABLE THAN AN ASTROPHYSICIST HOWEVER A COMPUTATIONAL ASTROPHYSICIST SHOULD SPECIALIZES A LOT IN FLUID COMPUTATION IS WAY MORE EMPLOYABLE THAN A STRING THEORIST WELL ACTUALLY PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE IS MORE EMPLOYABLE THAN A STRIG THEORIST
IM THINKING TWICE BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE THAT STUDY THEORETICAL PHYSICS GET HIRED IN INSURANCE ETC MORE THAN IN THE ACTUAL RESEARCH THEORETICAL PHYSICIST
I THOUGHT I WANTED TO DO ASTRO WHEN IN HIGH SCHOOL AND HAD THE OPTION OF MOVING INTERSTATE TO DO A BSC MAJORING IN ASTROPHYSICS OR STAYING PUT AND DOING A GENERAL PHYSICS BSC OVER A WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS OUT OF LAZINESS I CHOSE THE LATTER AND IN HINDSIGHT IT WAS A VERY GOOD DECISION AS I FOUND THAT I DIDN'T LIKE ASTROPHYSICS THAT MUCH EVEN THOUGH I TOOK COSMOLOGY AND GR DURING MY MSC IN DOING THE MORE GENERAL COURSE I FOUND SOMETHING THAT I WAS ACTUALLY REALLY INTERESTED IN AND I HAD OPTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY IN A NUMBER OF AREAS

I THINK UNDERGRAD PHYSICS SHOULD BE AS GENERAL AS POSSIBLE SO THAT YOU GET A SAMPLE OF EVERYTHING ONLY THEN CAN YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU LIKE
AN ASTRONOMY ASTROPHYSICS DEGREE IS BASICALLY A PHYSICS DEGREE WITH A FEW EXTRA COURSES AND MAYBE SOME SUBSTITUTIONS YOU REALLY START TO FOCUS IN GRAD SCHOOL

ALL OF THOSE COURSES LOOK IMPORTANT FOR A FOUNDATION IN ASTROPHYSICS WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF PHYSICS OF QUANTUM MATTER WHICH IS A BIT VAGUE

IF POSSIBLE IT WOULD BE GOOD TO GET SOME SUMMER EXPERIENCE SOMEWHERE WITH ASTROPHYSICS RESEARCH
OPTICS

DO YOU REALLY HAVE TO ASK

VECTOR CALCULUS

YES

MODERN PHYSICS FOCUSING ON SPECIAL RELATIVITY QUANTUM MECHANICS

YES

ELECTROMAGNETISM MODERN MATERIALS

YES

LINEAR ALGEBRA

YES

MECHANICS

YES

ATOMIC NUCLEAR PHYSICS

YES

PHYSICS OF QUANTUM MATTER

PROBABLY DEPENDING ON WHAT EXACTLY QUANTUM MATTER MEANS

THERMAL STATISTICAL PHYSICS

YES

ELECTROMAGNETIC THEORY PLASMA PHYSICS

YES
THIS ALL SOUNDS FINE HONESTLY THE BIGGEST RESUME BUILDER IS GETTING SOME UNDERGRAD RESEARCH EXPERIENCE EVEN IF IT'S NOT IN ASTRO AND TAKING SOME ASTRO COURSES GRAD SCHOOLS AREN'T SO FOCUSED ON THE EXACT COURSE CONTENT PROVIDED IT'S A FAIRLY TYPICAL PHYSICS EDUCATION
SINCE A STRUCTURAL SIZE FOR THE ELECTRON WOULD BE DETECTABLE AS A DEVIATION FROM STANDARD MODEL SCATTERING THE EXPERIMENTAL UPPER LIMIT SHOULD BE ABOUT THE LENGTH CORRESPONDING TO MAXIMUM ENERGIES PROBED IN LEPTON COLLIDES I'D SAY TO MASCULINE THIS IS BECAUSE THE SM MODELS THE ELECTRON WITH A LOCAL FIELD THEORY WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO IT BEING PLINTHLIKE

HOWEVER GIVEN THIS MEASUREMENT IT'S ACTUALLY STUPENDOUSLY UNLIKELY THE ELECTRON IS A COMPOSITE OBJECT SMALLER THAN THIS EXPERIMENTAL LIMIT BECAUSE IT WOULD NEED TO BE MADE FROM SUBCOMPONENTS INCREDIBLY MORE MASSIVE THAN ITSELF WHOSE MASS IS THEN MAGICALLY CANCELED BY THEIR NEGATIVE BINDING ENERGY TO GIVE THE HALF A MEV ELECTRON MASSACHUSETTS THERE IS A FINETUNING PROBLEM

OTHER SYSTEM IN WHICH THE ELECTRON IS EXTENDED BUT NOT LITERALLY COMPOSITE EAST G STRING THEORIES CAN BYPASS THIS PROBLEM
AT THE MOMENT WE CONSIDER THE ELECTRON TO BE A POINT PARTICLE WITH NO MEANINGFUL RADIUS

LAST I'VE HEARD THE UPPER BOUND WAS SOMETHING LIKE MASCULINE
THERE ARE NO PARTICLES ONLY EXCITATIONS IN FIELDS
YOU CAN GET REALLY FAR EAST G UNDERSTAND CHEMISTRY BY TREATING THE ELECTRON AS A WAVE USUALLY AND THEREBY ASSUME A RADIUS DERIVED BY SOLVING SCHROEDINGER S EQ IN A PRACTICAL SENSE THEN THE RADIUS IS THE APPROXIMATE DIMENSION OF ATOMIC AND MOLECULAR ORBITALS HARD CORE PARTICLE PHYSICISTS AND THE STRING CROWD MAY DISAGREE BUT M IS A GREAT USEFUL RESULT THE INTERACTION OF RADIATION AND MATTER AND THE CHEMICAL REACTIVITY OF MOLECULAR ATOMIC SPECIES IS USEFULLY UNDERSTOOD BY THE WAVE VIEW OF THE ELECTRONS I UNDERSTAND THAT FUNDAMENTALLY IT'S A POINT PARTICLE BUT MY CHEMISTRY BACKGROUND FIRMLY DATES MY CONCEPTION OF THE ELECTRONS TO THAT OF PAULING ET AL IT'S ALL WAVES DUDE
AT THE CONCLUSION OF THIS SERIES ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WITH THEORIES OF PHYSICS THAT ARISE FROM ASSUMING THAT SPACETIME IS A CONTINUUM I'D LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS IN TRIBUTE TO JOHN BAEZ A MATHEMATICAL PHYSICIST WHO IS A REMARKABLE FIGURE AND A VERY PROLIFIC WRITER IN THE FIELD

THE WIDE RANGE OF HIS WORK IS CLEARLY EVIDENT FROM HIS HOME PAGE AT UCR

HE ALSO AUTHORS THE AZIMUTH BLOG HETP AND IS ONE OF THE REGULARS AT THE CAFE

HE WRITES A LOT OF PHYSICSFORUMS ARTICLES

HE PARTICIPATED IN THE ORIGINAL USENET PHYSICS FAQ AND IS ONE OF THE HOSTS OF IT I BELIEVE HE IS NO LONGER ACTIVE IN MAINTAINING IT

HE HAS A REGULAR PRESENCE ON TWITTER AND GOOGLE

YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT HIS CRACKPOT INDEX

HERE'S AN TWO-PART INTERVIEW OF HIM

THE ABOVE IS JUST SOME OF THE STUFF HE IS INVOLVED IN IF INTERESTED THERE'S A LOT MORE AT HIS UCR HOME PAGE THERE'S A LOT THERE BUT I ESPECIALLY RECOMMEND CHECKING OUT HIS FUN STUFF HIS SERIOUS STUFF AND HIS TALKS AND SEMINARS




WONDERFUL SERIES
SOMETIMES INSTEAD OF DOING ALL THE ALGEBRA OR SMALLER STEPS I WRITE A SUMMARY OF THE IDEA THEN WRITE MAJOR LINES IT REALLY HELPS WHEN MY WRITING IS A BIT BEHIND AND LET'S ME FOCUS ON THE CONCEPTS AND IDEAS RATHER THAN GRITTY DETAILS THOSE I SAVE FOR SITTING DOWN BY MYSELF
KEEPING UP WITH COPYING SHOULDN'T PREVENT YOU FROM ACTIVELY FOLLOWING THE LECTURE OTHER THAN THAT YOU SHOULD NOTE THINGS SAID THAT AREN'T OBVIOUS SOMETIMES YOU ARE BUSY WITH DETAILS AND MISS CATCHING THE GENERAL IDEA
TRY NOT TO COPY WORD FOR WORD YOU COULD ALSO WRITE YOURSELF NOTES ON HOW YOU GOT TO A CERTAIN STEP I THINK THESE ARE CALLED ASIDES
I REALLY ONLY VIEW LECTURE TIME AS A CHANCE TO BE INTRODUCED TO THE TOPIC BY SOMEONE ELSE I SKIM THE CHAPTER GO TO CLASS THEN ACTUALLY LEARN THE STUFF WHILE DOING PROBLEM SETS AND REFERENCING THE BOOK OR ONLINE LECTURE NOTES NOT NECESSARILY FROM A PROFESSOR AT MY SCHOOL LOTS OF RESOURCES ONLINE I DON'T EVEN TRY TO TAKE NOTES IN CLASS AND I FEEL LIKE I GET A LOT MORE OUT OF THE LECTURE
INTERESTING READ I JUST DISCOVERED THE CAVENDISH EXPERIMENT LAST NIGHT WHEN A CONSPIRACY CLAIM THAT GRAVITY WAS A LIE I WASN'T AWARE THAT THE CONSTANT WAS SO INACCURATE RELATIVE TO OTHERS

WOULD GRAVITATIONAL WAVE RESEARCH POSSIBLY INFORM A MORE ACCURATE MEASUREMENT ALSO IF G VARIED AS THE ARTICLE SEEMED TO IMPLY AS A POSSIBILITY WOULDN'T THAT BE OBVIOUSLY OBSERVABLE IN VARIOUS LONG-DISTANCE MEASUREMENTS FOR INSTANCE WOULDN'T THE SPEED OF ANY LONG-TERM LONG-DISTANCE CRAFTS LIKE NEW HORIZONS VARY CONSIDERABLY AS G DID
THE DARK AGES OF THE UNIVERSE WERE NEARING THEIR END MILLION YEARS AFTER THE BIG BANG WHICH IS MILLION YEARS LATER THAN PREVIOUS MEASUREMENTS INDICATED
CHECKMATE ATHEISTS
YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST BOYS YOUNG EARTH THEORY WAS CORRECT ALL ALONG
JUST WHEN I THOUGHT I HAD A VAGUE AND DIM UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE GOING ON THEY THROW THIS CURVE-BALL SHAKES FIST


DEAR GOD THIS COMMENT SECTION

IT'S BECAUSE SPIN IS AN AWFUL TERM WE USE TO SHORTEN INTRINSIC ANGULAR MOMENTUM NONE OF THESE TEENY QUANTUM PARTICLES BOSONS OR FERMIONS ARE ACTUALLY SPINNING LIKE A TOP
REMOVED
ALSO IT FALLS OUT OF DIRAC BUT MY TINY BRAIN I AM A CHEMIST TAKES HIS RESULT ON FAITH I UNDERSTAND THE NECESSARY SYMMETRY BE TWEEN TIME AND SPACE WHY THE DIRAC EQUATION EQ IS SO DIFFERENT COMPARED TO SCHROEDINGER DUE TO TAKING ONE MORE DERIVATIVE WITH RESPECT TO TIME AND REMOVING ELECTROSTATIC POTENTIAL BAFFLES ME APPARENTLY FERMI DIRAC AND PAULI DID NOT GET LOST ON THE WAY TO SPINORS AND SUCH GOT TO TIP MY HAT TO DIRAC HE WAS TRULY BADASS
THIS IS AN EXCELLENT QUESTION

HOWEVER IS IT MEANINGFUL FOR PHOTONS TO HAVE INTRINSIC ANGULAR MOMENTUM WITHOUT TIME IS MOMENTUM EVEN THE CORRECT CONCEPT TO USE HERE
I MOSTLY AGREE WITH YOU I THINK THE TROUBLE IS WITH THE WORD EXPERIENCE NOT THE WORD TIME IT EXPERIENCES TIME IN THE SENSE THAT DEPENDING ON YOUR CHOICE OF ITS CO-ORDINATE TIME GENERALLY CHANGES ALONG ITS TRAJECTORY BUT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT WOULD MEAN FOR A PHOTON TO EXPERIENCE OR FEEL PROPER TIME WHICH BY DEFINITION IS THE TIME OBSERVERS NOTICE PASSING FOR THEM BECAUSE IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A WELL-DEFINED FRAME OF REFERENCE IT'S A CONTEXTUAL LIE TO SAY THAT IT DOESN'T EXPERIENCE TIME PASSING AT ALL BECAUSE MORE ACCURATELY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SAY IS THERE'S NO WAY TO DESCRIBE WHAT AN OBJECT MOVING AT C OBSERVES IF IT EVEN MAKES SENSE TO SAY THAT IT DOES
IN A NUTSHELL BECAUSE WE MEASURED IT
THE ANSWER IS A MODIFICATION OF THE QUESTION

A SPIN CANNOT CHANGE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T EXPERIENCE TIME BECAUSE IT TRAVELS AT THE SPEED OF CAUSALITY

COMPARATIVELY PARTICLES LIKE ELECTRONS CAN EVOLVE OVER TIME THE FACT THAT A SPIN UP ELECTRON CAN BECOME A SPIN DOWN ELECTRON SHOWS THAT IT DOES EXPERIENCE TIME
REFERENCE FRAMES A PHOTON ITSELF DOESN'T EXPERIENCE TIME BUT WE DO AND WE'RE THE ONES DOING THE MEASURING
IF IT DID EXPERIENCE TIME IT'D PROPAGATE AT BELOW C THEN IT'D BE POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO OVERTAKE IT AND SEE IT'S HELICITY REVERSED
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION CAN BE UNDERSTOOD WHEN YOU INTERNALIZE THE FACT THAT WHAT WE PERCEIVE AS TIME IS AN EMERGENT PROPERTY OF QUANTUM MECHANICAL SPIN ERGO PHOTONS ARE SIMPLY THE FORCE CARRIER THAT ALTERS AN OBJECT'S SPIN AND THUS THE CONCEPT OF TIME IS MEANINGLESS FOR A PHOTON

I'M ASHAMED THAT THE OTHER PARAGRAPH ABOUT FRAME OF REFERENCE GOT SO MANY VOTES
DOES IT HAVE SPIN OR JUST ORIENTATION FOR EXAMPLE MY LCD FILTERS UNPOLARIZED LIGHT BUT THAT LIGHT IS JUST ORIENTED A SPECIFIC WAY IT ISN'T ROTATING OR RATHER

LIGHT DOES NOT TWIRL

EDIT

OR ARE WE SPEAKING LOCALLY TO THE PHOTON IRRESPECTIVE OF ITS WAVE ORIENTATION IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT LIGHT DOES NOT EXPERIENCE TIME AND WHAT DO TIME AND SPIN HAVE TO DO WITH EACH OTHER
YES

WHETHER YOU GET MONEY OR CREDIT FOR IT THAT DEPENDS ON WHAT PROGRAMS ARE IN PLACE WITH YOUR COLLEGE AND THE UNIVERSITY BUT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES YOU MIGHT HAVE TO SEEK THEM OUT

I'VE HAD STUDENTS WORK FOR ME FROM LOCAL CHEEPS A THINGY IN QUEBEC
I THINK IT WOULD DEPEND OF BOTH AND THE DEPARTMENT YOU WANT TO RESEARCH IN
WHILE THERE ARE NO RESTRICTIONS ON DOING THIS AT LEAST NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE PROFESSOR USUALLY THE PROFESSOR OR RESEARCHER IS THE ONE WHO MAKES THE TIME TO CONDUCT A RESEARCH PROJECT WITH UNDERGRADUATES AS OPPOSED TO LAB PIS OR WORKING IN A LAB IN GENERAL SO IT'S ENTIRELY UP TO THEM

HOWEVER IF YOU SEND A PROFESSOR AN EMAIL EXPLAINING YOUR DRIVE TO DO RESEARCH AND SHOW THEM THAT YOU'RE KNOWLEDGABLE IN THEIR SUBJECT I WOULD SAY THAT YOUR CHANCES ARE GOOD

GOOD LUCK AND KEEP US UPDATED
OH I WONDERED WHAT THIS TWEET WAS ABOUT
HE'S CORRECT YOU HAVE TO THINK OF IT IN TERMS OF CHARGE AND CURRENT RATHER THAN WHAT'S PHYSICALLY MOVING

EDIT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUT IT MIGHT HELP
YOU'RE CORRECT THAT ELECTRONS WOULD BE MOVING ONTO THE SPHERES FROM THE GROUND HOWEVER SINCE THE QUESTION EXPLICITLY ASKED FOR THE SIGN OF THE CHARGE TRANSFERRED TO THE GROUND YOU WOULD NEED TO ADD THAT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF AN OBSERVER ELECTRONS MOVING ONTO THE SPHERES WOULD LOOK THE SAME AS SOME POSITIVE CHARGE MOVING FROM THE SPHERES TO THE GROUND

I SUSPECT THAT THE QUESTION IS STILL ASSUMING AN EARLIER STAGE OF KNOWLEDGE WHERE WE KNOW THAT CHARGE EXISTS AND THAT WE DEAL WITH SIGNED CHARGES BUT HAVEN'T YET DECIDED THAT ELECTRONS AND IONS ARE THE PARTICLES THAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN NEVER MIND DISSECTING THESE IONS INTO THEIR INDIVIDUAL PIECES IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT IN CONDENSED MATTER SPECIFICALLY IF YOU'RE DISCUSSING SEMICONDUCTORS POSITIVE HOLES ARE TREATED AS QUASI PARTICLES IN THEIR OWN RIGHT FOLLOWING THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE THAT IF IT WALKS LIKE A DUCK AND QUACKS LIKE A DUCK YOU MIGHT AS WELL TREAT IT LIKE A DUCK WITH THAT IN MIND FOCUSING TOO CAREFULLY ON THE MOTION OF THE ELECTRONS AND IGNORING THE APPARENT MOTION OF THE VACANCIES THEY LEAVE BEHIND MIGHT BE PROBLEMATIC FOR FUTURE COURSES
CHARGE AND ELECTRONS AREN'T THE SAME THING TECHNICALLY HOLES WOULD BE MOVING FROM THE BALL TO THE GROUND
CHARGE LIKE ELECTRICAL CURRENT IS AN ABSTRACT CONCEPT SEPARATED FROM THE BEHAVIOR OF INDIVIDUAL CHARGE CARRIERS NOT ALL OF WHICH ARE ELECTRONS
DISSENTING OPINION HERE I PERSONALLY WOULD SAY GO PHYSICS I DITCHED ENGINEERING EARLY ON FOR PHYSICS SOMEONE ONCE DESCRIBED TO ME PHYSICS AS THE LIBERAL ARTS OF SCIENCE SUBJECTS MANY SCHOOLS CATEGORIZE THEIR UNDERGRAD PHYSICS DEGREES AS BAS IN THE UNITED STATES

WHILE AN UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE IN ENGINEERING WILL DO A GOOD JOB OF SETTING YOU UP TO BE A SKILLED WORKER I LIKE TO THINK OF IT AS MODERN EDUCATED BLUE COLLAR I BELIEVE A SOLID PHYSICS EDUCATION WILL BENEFIT YOU MORE AS A PERSON BY DEVELOPING BETTER YOUR ABILITY TO THINK CRITICALLY PROBLEM SOLVE AND REASON

THE BIGGEST REASON I DROPPED ENGINEERING FOR PHYSICS THE LACK OF ANSWERING THE WHY MY PHYSICS EDUCATION DID A MUCH BETTER JOB OF THIS

THE DOWNSIDE TO STUDYING PHYSICS IS IT DOESN'T SET YOU UP FOR A JOB IF ALL YOU DO IS THE BARE MINIMUM IF YOU WANT TO JUST DO SCHOOLWORK AND ONE OR TWO INTERNSHIPS AND BE ABLE TO FIND GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT ENGINEERING WOULD DEFINITELY BE THE BETTER ROUTE I MADE THE MOST OF MY PHYSICS EDUCATION AND COUPLED IT WITH A GREAT LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM BEFORE GRADUATION I WAS PRESENTED WITH OPPORTUNITIES NOT JUST IN THE STEM FIELD BUT ALSO FINANCE BUSINESS AND CONSULTING

I ULTIMATELY CHOSE TO GO THE LET'S WAKE UP AT AN UNGODLY HOUR EVERYDAY ROUTE STRAIGHT OUT OF COLLEGE BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO AND I FIGURED THAT FOUR YEARS WASN'T TOO BAD PLUS GETTING ONE SHOT TO DO THIS WAS INCENTIVE ENOUGH

NEXT STEP WHO KNOWS I BELIEVE MY CHOICE TO STUDY PHYSICS HAS OPENED MANY MANY DOORS FOR ME
I'D SAY GO FOR AEROSPACE ENGINEERING LIKE YOU SAID GETTING A PHD REQUIRES A LOT OF EFFORT AND COMMITMENT AND IF WORKING IN PHYSICS SOUNDS BORING TO YOU THEN YOU PROBABLY WON'T HAVE THE MOTIVATION TO FINISH YOUR STUDIES

ENGINEERING SHOULD BE THE IDEAL CHOICE FOR YOU SINCE YOU LIKE CREATING THINGS AND IT ALSO HAS THE PHYSICAL COMPONENT IN IT SO YOU WOULD LEARN SOME PHYSICS ALONG THE WAY WITHOUT THE COMMITMENT OF DEDICATING YOURSELF ENTIRELY TO THE FIELD

BUT I REALIZE IT'S REALLY HARD TO GET A JOB AT NASA BOEING OR SPACE

THAT'S TRUE IT'S NOT THAT EASY TO GET A JOB AT BIG NAMES LIKE NASA OR SPACE BUT IF SOME PEOPLE HAVE DONE IT THEN SO CAN YOU WORK HARD ENJOY YOURSELF AND PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE THE SKY IS NO LONGER THE LIMIT FRIEND
GO FOR AEROSPACE YOU'LL HAVE TO GO INTO THE INDUSTRY ANYWAY IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE LIVING ON AMEN FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE AND YOU MIGHT AS WELL GET A HEAD START BY GETTING AN ENGINEERING DEGREE
TIL A COMPUTER SCIENTIST IS A PROGRAMMER
I WOULD NEVER SAY GETTING A DEGREE IN CS IS USELESS IT'S ONE OF THE BEST DEGREES TO GET IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A JOB IN PROGRAMMING COMPUTER SCIENTISTS ARE NEVER HURTING FOR WORK YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY BE MORE LIKELY TO GET A JOB IN THE SPACE INDUSTRY WITH A CS DEGREE THAN AERO LOL
YOU HAVE AMAZING QUALIFICATIONS DON'T LET THE FACT THAT YOU SPECIALIZE CURRENTLY IN SOMETHING UNRELATED TO THEIR COMPANY MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE NOT UP TO SNUFF YOU NEED TO SELL YOURSELF AS A PROBLEM SOLVER AND A CRITICAL THINKER WITH A VAST ARRAY OF MATHEMATICS SKILLS AS WELL AS RESEARCH SKILLS AND TEAM WORKING SKILLS DESCRIBE TO THEM HOW YOU CAN QUICKLY LEARN THEIR SYSTEMS AND HOW TO BE EFFICIENT IN THEIR WORK ENVIRONMENT AND THEN EXPLAIN THAT YOUR BACKGROUND BRINGS AN EXTRA LEVEL OF INGENUITY THAT FOCUSED ENGINEERS ARE MISSING
THE PION IS A SCALAR AND SO THE FINAL SPINS MUST BE OPPOSITE THEN YOU CAN SEE THE FINAL HELICITIES MUST BE EQUAL

IF THE MASS OF THE LEPTON IS ZERO THEN HELICITY CHIRALITY WHILE FOR THE ANTINEUTRINO OF NEGLIGIBLE MASS HELICITY CHIRALITY AND SO ONE OF THE PARTICLES MUST HAVE RIGHT CHIRALITY BUT THIS MEANS THE AMPLITUDE IS ZERO BECAUSE THE CHARGED WEAK FORCE ONLY COUPLES TO LEFT CHIRALITY

THEREFORE THE DECAY WIDTH MUST BE PROPORTIONAL TO A POSITIVE POWER OF THE LEPTON MASS HENCE THE SUPPRESSION OF THE ELECTRON DECAY CHANNEL WRT THE MUON CHANNEL PROPORTIONAL TO A POWER OF THE ELECTRON MUON MASS RATIO
US SCHREIBER IS ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF NAB WHICH IS A GREAT WIKI ON MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS FROM THE HIGHER CATEGORICAL POINT OF VIEW

ALSO CARTAN GEOMETRY IS PRETTY AWESOME IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN IT THERE'S A GREAT BOOK BY ROYAL WEST SHARPE ON THIS TOPIC
GOD I NEED TO HEAR GROUP THEORY
I AM AMUSED BY SOME OF THE CHOICES OF WORDING I LIKED HOW IN THE MIDDLE OF A JUMBLE OF TECHNICAL JARGON WE HAVE A SENTENCE THAT STARTS WITH

THIS BASIC FACT OF

THEN LATER WE GET

NOW A MIRACLE HAPPENS

GOLF CLAP WELL DONE SIR
IF IT COULD EXIST HOW WOULD NEGATIVE MASS BEHAVE
IN A RECENT R ASKSCIENCE POST THERE WAS MENTIONED THAT A CONTRACTED SPRING HAS MORE MASS THAN AN UNCONTRACTED ONE BECAUSE OF E MC 2 I ASSUME THIS MEANS REST MASS RIGHT IN ANY WAY IF ANYBODY HAS TOO MUCH TIME ON THEIR HANDS EVEN THOUGH THIS MIGHT BE THE WRONG SUBREDDIT FOR THIS COULD ANYBODY GO A BIT DEEPER INTO THE MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION OF THIS
MY QUESTION IS WHY IS THE DETECTOR IN A EXPERIMENT NOT CONSIDERED AN OBSERVER
WHY DO ELECTRICAL AND MAGNETIC FIELDS ALWAYS OPERATE AT RIGHT ANGLES TO EACH OTHER

I GUESS I'M STILL HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE FACT THAT THESE TWO FORCES ARE REALLY ONE UNIFIED FIELD FORCE THING IN THE CURRENT MODEL ARE THE WORLDS FIELD AND FORCE EVEN DISTINCT IF IT'S ONLY ONE THING WHY DO WE SEE IT REPRESENTED IN SUCH DISTINCT WAYS IF IT'S ACTUALLY TWO THINGS WHAT CAUSES THEM TO INTERACT SO CLOSELY ALL THE TIME

ALSO IF YOU WANT SOME EXTRA CREDIT I STILL HAVE NO IDEA WHY POLARIZED LIGHT DOESN'T JUST SPONTANEOUSLY JUST VIA ENTROPY SUGAR WILL DISSOLVE SPONTANEOUSLY INTO WATER SO WHY DOES LIGHT COLLIMATE AND JUST STAY THAT WAY
WHY ARE THE INERTIAL REST MASS OF A BODY AND THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE IT EXERTS ON OTHER OBJECTS PROPORTIONAL TO EACH OTHER


IN GR YOU HAVE THE STRESS ENERGY MOMENTUM TENSOR AND THE EINSTEIN TENSOR MY QUESTION IS WHAT IS A TENSOR I CAN KIND OF GET A FEELING IN MY MIND FOR THE STRESS ENERGY TENSOR RELATING TO THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD AND FROM WIKIPEDIA IT SEEMS THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING TO DO WITH VECTORS BUT ONCE THE ARTICLE USES TOPOLOGICAL MATHEMATICAL TERMS IM QUICKLY LOST IF SOMEONE HAS AN ANALOGY ON THE LEVEL OF FOR INSTANCE MOLECULES BEING REARRANGED IN A BALLOON REFLECTING HIGH ENTROPY THAT'D BE JUST GREAT
WHY CAN WE SEE A STAR PLACED LIGHTYEARS FROM ANY POSITION IN A METER SQUARE LET'S SAY I AM IN A POSITION I SEE A VERY DISTANT STAR I MOVE A LITTLE BIT AND I STILL SEE IT I WOULD SAY THAT AFTER SO MUCH DISTANCE THE PHOTON SHOULD DISPERSE SOMEHOW EVEN A LASER SHOT FROM SUCH A DISTANCE WOULD DISPERSE

2 CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY STARTING FROM QUANTUM THEORY GRAVITY OR GENERAL RELATIVITY SHOULD NOT EXIST

REMOVED
WHAT IS THE STANDARD EXPLANATION WHY MASSLESS PARTICLE MUST MOVE AT SPEED OF LIGHT

I HAVE MY WAY OF EXPLAINING IT BUT I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE ARE DIFFERENT ARGUMENTS

WHEN I STUDIED SPECIAL RELATIVITY I SOMEHOW NEVER HEARD EXPLANATION BY PROFESSOR WHETHER IT IS BECAUSE I MISSED CLASS OR SOMETHING ELSE I DON'T KNOW

I EXPLAINED IT TO MYSELF BY USING COUNTER EXAMPLE SUPPOSE THAT YOU HAVE MASSLESS PARTICLE WHICH MOVES WITH VELOCITY V COUNTY THEN EXISTS FRAME OF REFERENCE IN WHICH PARTICLE IS AT REST AND SINCE IT HAS NO MASS IT SHOULD HAVE NO ENERGY WHICH IS CONTRADICTION
I'M A FOURTH YEAR MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS STUDENT IN CANADA IMMENSELY INTERESTED IN STUDYING FIELD THEORIES BOTH CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM BUT WITHOUT ANY REAL IDEA WHERE TO START I'M UNSURE WHERE MY GRADUATE STUDIES WILL TAKE ME AND I WANT TO STUDY THIS STUFF CASUALLY SO I'D LIKE AN IDEA OF WHERE TO START

AS WELL SINCE I'M DOING A FINAL PROJECT THIS SEMESTER HAVING A BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE IN FIELD THEORIES MAY BE NICE I WAS GIVEN A POSSIBLE PROJECT TALKING ABOUT VORTEX SOLUTIONS FLAT DIRECTIONS OF SCALAR POTENTIAL AGUE THEORY SUPERSYMMETRIC THEORY WITH ZERO SUPERPOTENTIAL AND A LOT OF OTHER THINGS I'VE NEVER HEARD OF OR ONLY HAVE A FAINT IDEA OF WHAT'S MEANT

ANY HELP WOULD BE MUCH APPRECIATED
ARE THERE ANY VIDEO RESOURCES THAT GO INTO DETAIL FOR THE MATH BEHIND THE SECOND SEQUENCE OF UNIVERSITY PHYSICS STARTING WITH ELECTRIC FIELDS AND DIPOLES
I AM LITERALLY DYING IN CLASSICAL I PASSED PHYSICS WITH FLYING COLORS COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDING THE TOPICS AND EVERYTHING BUT I CAN'T EVEN WRAP MY HEAD AROUND SOLVING ELECTRIC FIELDS AND DIPOLES MATHEMATICALLY AND IT'S THE 2ND WEEK OF CLASSICAL

I GO TO ALL THE CLASSES AND RECITATIONS I READ THE BOOK AND ALL USUALLY IF I ENCOUNTER A SITUATION LIKE THIS I CAN WORK IT OUT WITH OUTSIDE RESOURCES BUT ALL OF THE LECTURES I AM FINDING ONLINE DO NOT GO INTO THE MATH EXAMPLES ARE THE WALTER LEWIN LECTURES AND BOZEMAN SCIENCE THEY SIMPLY EXPLAIN THE CONCEPTS

EXAMPLE OF PROFESSOR LEONARD

THANK YOU VERY MUCH

HELLO R PHYSICS I HAVE A QUESTION THAT I CAN'T SEEM TO LOGICALLY FIGURE OUT WITHOUT SOME HELP I DON'T IMAGINE I'M RIGHT BUT I CAN'T FIND THE REASONS I'M WRONG SO HELP
I'VE STUDIED PHYSICS IN MY OWN TIME FOR YEARS BUT I AM ATTENDING MY FIRST COURSE IN IT THIS YEAR I HOPE MY QUESTION IS UNDERSTANDABLE I'M GONNA WRITE A PAPER FOR FUN AND HOPEFULLY SOME EXTRA CREDIT

MY QUESTION IS ABOUT THE REDSHIFT WE SEE WHEN LOOKING AT GALAXIES ALL GALAXIES IN ALL DIRECTIONS ARE ACCELERATING AWAY FROM US EXPECT FOR THE ANDROMEDA WHICH IS SET TO COLLIDE WITH THE MILKY WAY I BELIEVE SPACE IS THOUGHT TO BE A PERFECT VACUUM AND IT'S REALLY CLOSE TO ONE I LOOKED UP AND FOUND THAT THEIR ARE A FEW ATOMS PER CUBIC METER WE HUMANS GOT THIS INFORMATION IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM SO IT'D BE SAFE TO ASSUME THAT INTERGALACTIC SPACE MIGHT BE ONE ATOM PER CUBIC METER OR LESS GALAXIES WE SEE ARE HUNDREDS OF LIGHT YEARS AWAY AND ONE LIGHT YEAR CONTAINS METERS IN THAT AMOUNT OF METERS THE PHOTONS WE RECEIVE FROM THE GALAXIES WOULD HAVE ENCOUNTERED ATOMS AT SOME POINT RIGHT HOW DO PHOTONS INTERACT WITH SINGLER ATOMS IF THEY DO INTERACT IT'D MOST LIKELY BE HYDROGEN HELIUM LITHIUM MAYBE EVEN SOME METALS FE PB BUT THOSE WOULD BE MORE RARE THEN THE ALREADY RARE INTERACTION OF ATOMS IN INTERGALACTIC SPACE LASTLY MY BIGGEST QUESTION WITH CONCERNING REDSHIFT IF THE PHOTONS WE RECEIVE FROM THESE GALAXIES HAVE INTERACTED WITH ATOMS ALONG THEIR JOURNEY TO EARTH COULD THIS CAUSE THE OBSERVER EARTHLINGS TO EXPERIENCE GALAXIES TO BE MORE RED DUE TO THE PHOTONS JOURNEY HAVING BEEN IMPEDED BY SOME ATOMS
I HOPE THAT SOMEONE CAN HELP ME
WORKING ON A PROJECT THAT REQUIRES A MV MM ELECTRIC FIELD SET UP I HAVE A PLAN ON HOW TO GET THE FIELD BUT IS THERE ANY ROUGH WAY FOR ME TO CONFIRM THAT IT DOES INDEED HAVE A VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY MV MM WITHOUT NEEDING TO BUY AN EXPENSIVE ELECTRIC FIELD METER

IF BUYING A METER IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET GOOD RESULTS ARE THERE ANY IN PARTICULAR WHICH WOULD BE GOOD FOR SOMETHING SMALL LIKE THIS IT'LL BE TWO ALUMINUM FOIL PLATES ABOUT CM APART HOOKED UP TO A V POWER SOURCE I'M REALLY DUMB WITH PHYSICS THANKS IN ADVANCE TO ANYBODY THAT REPLIES
WHICH TECHNOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS WERE POSSIBLE AFTER THE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE DUALITY PROPERTY
HOW DO I FIND THE GRAPH OF VELOCITY IF I HAVE THE GRAPH OF ACCELERATION THANKS
IS THERE A LIMIT TO HOW MUCH ENERGY DEVICES THAT FUNCTION ON THE PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT CAN TAKE WHAT IF THEY'RE TAKING IN REALLY HIGH ENERGY PHOTONS DO THERE EXIST ALTERNATIVE METHODS FOR DEALING WITH HIGHER ENERGIES OR WILL NORMAL DEVICES SUFFICE

THANKS

EDIT TO BE SPECIFIC I AM REFERRING TO PHOTONS WITH ENERGY LEVELS IN THE RANGE OF EV OR GREATER
HEY I WOULD LIKE TO ASK SOMETHING TO START WITH AND THEN CONTINUE MY THOUGHTS I HAVE NO SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE OF THIS SUBJECT SO WHAT DOES THE POTENTIAL EXISTENCE OF WORMHOLES MEAN FOR SPACETIME
WHAT WOULD BE THE CONSEQUENCES IF THE SPEED OF LIGHT WAS MUCH SLOWER SAY AROUND THE SAME AS THE SPEED OF SOUND
COULD AN INTERSTELLAR PROBE HARNESS THE CBR AS A POWER SOURCE


I KNOW IT WOULD ONLY BE A VERY VERY VERY TINY AMOUNT OF POWER EVEN IF IT WERE POSSIBLE AND PROBABLY A RADIOACTIVE SUBSTANCE WITH A VERY LONG HALF-LIFE WOULD BE MORE USEFUL AS A IN PRACTICE

BUT WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE AT ALL
IF YOU HAVE A GARDEN HOSE PUSHING OUT WATER IT WILL BE PUSHED AROUND DUE TO CONSERVATION OF MOMENTUM PREVENTING IT FROM HANGING STRAIGHT DOWN BUT IF YOU PUT JUST THE TIP OF THAT HOSE IN WATER ALL OF A SUDDEN IT CALMS DOWN AND HANGS AS IF NO WATER IS COMING OUT OF IT WHY DOES CONSERVATION OF MOMENTUM APPEAR TO VANISH WHY DOES THE FORCE SUDDENLY VANISH
WHY DOES THE RELATIVISTIC ENERGY FORMULA NOT WORK FOR LOW SPEEDS
IF THE CHARGE IS STATIONARY AND THEN STARTS MOVING FROM POINT A TO POINT B IT WOULD EMIT RADIATION IF IT IS ALREADY MOVING AT A CONSTANT VELOCITY IT WOULD NOT

CONSIDER THAT IF YOU WERE MOVING AT THE SAME CONSTANT VELOCITY AS THE CHARGE IT WOULD APPEAR STATIONARY TO YOU
IF IT EMITTED RADIATION AT CONSTANT VELOCITY THE LAWS OF PHYSICS WOULD NOT BE FRAME INDEPENDENT
ALTHOUGH THE QUESTION DIDN'T ASK ABOUT ACCELERATION I SEE THE ISSUE IS SHOWING UP IN THE COMMENTS IN WHICH CASE THIS IS RELEVANT BOLDING MINE

THE RELEVANT QUESTIONS WE CONSIDER ARE DOES A UNIFORMLY ACCELERATED CHARGE ACTUALLY RADIATE IN A CONSTANT
GRAVITATIONAL FIELD SHOULD FREE-FALLING OBSERVERS DETECT ANY RADIATION EMITTED BY FREE-FALLING CHARGES IS THE EQUIVALENCE PRINCIPLE VALID FOR SUCH SITUATIONS IF THE ANSWER TO THE FIRST QUESTION IS AFFIRMATIVE A FREE-FALLING CHARGE WILL RADIATE ACCORDING TO AN OBSERVER AT REST BECAUSE IN A CONSTANT GRAVITATIONAL FIELD ANY PARTICLE SHOULD MOVE WITH UNIFORM ACCELERATION HOWEVER AN OBSERVER
FALLING FREELY WITH THE CHARGE WOULD OBSERVE IT AT REST AND NO RADIATION AT ALL HOW CAN THIS ANSWER BE COMPATIBLE WITH
AN AFFIRMATIVE ANSWER TO THE FIRST QUESTION MOREOVER IF THE EQUIVALENCE PRINCIPLE IS ASSUMED TO BE VALID WE WOULD
CONCLUDE THAT A CHARGED PARTICLE AT REST ON A TABLE SHOULD RADIATE BECAUSE FOR FREE-FALLING INERTIAL OBSERVERS THE PARTICLE IS ACCELERATING TO EXPLAIN THIS PUZZLE WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE CONCEPT OF RADIATION HAS NO ABSOLUTE MEANING
AND THAT IT DEPENDS BOTH ON THE RADIATION FIELD AND THE STATE OF
MOTION OF THE OBSERVER
THIS DEPENDENCE IS THE
MAIN CONCLUSION OF A CELEBRATED AND LONG DEBATE EXHAUSTIVELY PRESENTED IN THE RECENT SERIES OF PAPERS BY ERIKSEN AND
GRAN
WHERE THE READER CAN FIND RELEVANT REFERENCES


ABS PHYSICS

IS THERE A MORE RECENT PAPER
THE FIELD OF A CHARGED PARTICLE DOES NOT CONTAIN R RADIATION TERMS SO THERE CAN BE NO ENERGY PROPAGATION TO INFINITY AKA RADIATION
NO ROUGHLY THE UNIFORMLY MOVING CHARGED PARTICLE CARRIES ITS ELECTROSTATIC FIELD WITH IT AND BY THE LORENTZ TRANSFORMATIONS IF YOU ARE IN UNIFORM MOTION WITH RESPECT TO THAT CHARGE YOU WILL ALSO MEASURE A MAGNETIC FIELD CIRCULATING AROUND THAT CURRENT
I THINK IT'S GENERALLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU ATTEND A DIFFERENT INSTITUTION FOR YOUR GRADUATE DEGREE IF YOU'RE ABLE IN TERMS OF SCHOOLS A BIG PART OF THE APPLICATION PROCESS IS MAKING A CASE FOR WHY YOU WOULD BE A GOOD FIT FOR THE PROGRAM THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS IS TO FIND PROGRAMS WITH FACULTY CONDUCTING RESEARCH IN AREAS THAT YOU ARE SPECIFICALLY INTERESTED IN REACHING OUT TO THOSE FACULTY BEFORE DURING THE APPLICATION PROCESS IS ALSO NOT A BAD IDEA

PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY START WORKING ON RESEARCH AT YOUR CURRENT INSTITUTION IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY TALK TO FACULTY IN YOUR DEPARTMENT IF YOUR SCHOOL HAS THE OPTION TO DO AN HONORS THESIS DO IT SINCE YOU'RE A JUNIOR THIS YEAR YOU ARE ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR REUS RESEARCH EXPERIENCE FOR UNDERGRADUATES FOR NEXT SUMMER I THINK A LOT OF THE DEADLINES WILL BE IN MARCH BUT IT WOULDN'T HURT TO START LOOKING NOW AT THE END OF THE DAY I'D SAY GRADUATE PROGRAMS ARE MOST INTERESTED IN YOUR RESEARCH EXPERIENCE SO REALLY TAKE THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS TO BUILD UP SOME EXPERIENCE
I RECOMMEND THAT YOU READ WHAT TO DO WHEN THE TRISECTOR COMES

MORE PRAGMATICALLY TELL THEM ABOUT SABINE TALK TO A PHYSICIST SERVICE SHE AND HER TEAM HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE

THE MAJORITY OF MY CALLERS ARE THE ONES WHO SEEK ADVICE FOR AN IDEA THEY VE TRIED TO FORMALISE UNSUCCESSFULLY OFTEN FOR A LONG TIME THE VARIETY OF THEIR IDEAS IS BEWILDERING BUT THESE CALLERS HAVE TWO THINGS IN COMMON THEY SPEND AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF TIME ON THEIR THEORIES AND THEY ARE FRUSTRATED THAT NOBODY IS INTERESTED

IT'S PRICEY THOUGH FOR MINUTES
NOTHING CLEARS THAT UP QUITE LIKE PROBING THE THEORY FOR WHAT ITS WORTH IF YOU'RE WILLING REALLY GET INTO THE NITTY GRITTY OF THEIR THEORY AND FIND PROBLEMS IN IT OR REVEAL THAT IT COMES FROM POOR EPISTEMIC PRACTICE OR YOU FIND OUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY A GENIUS WHO JUST UNIFIED EVERYTHING WHO KNOWS
I'VE SEEN A VERY SIMILAR CASE FIRST HAND YOUNG STUDENT MISSING CLASS FOR HEALTH REASONS FANTASTICAL THEORY THAT DEBUNKS ALL OF MODERN SCIENCE HE HAD VERY SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS AND WOULD LAPSE INTO MANIA WHEN HE NEGLECTED TO TAKE HIS AMEDS IN GENERAL HE SEEMED LIKE A BRIGHT STUDENT AND YOU COULD NOT TELL FROM NORMAL CONVERSATION THAT ANYTHING WAS WRONG BUT IN HIS MANIC STATES HE WOULD GENERATE THESE CRACKPOT THEORIES THAT MADE PERFECT SENSE TO HIM MENTAL ILLNESS COMMONLY MANIFESTS ITSELF AT THIS AGE AND IF YOU THINK THIS COULD BE AN ISSUE YOU MAY WANT TO CONTACT THE APPROPRIATE COLLEGE HEALTH CHANNELS EXPLAINING TO YOUR STUDENT ABOUT THE NUMEROUS FALLACIES IN HIS OR HER THEORY WILL DO NO GOOD IN THIS CASE IF POSSIBLE MAYBE ASK HIS OR HER FRIENDS AFTER CLASS IF THEY HOPEFULLY HAVE SOME AND CASUALLY BRING UP YOUR STUDENT I HAVEN'T SEEN SO-AND-SO AROUND DO YOU GUYS DO HW WITH HIM AND SEE WHAT THEY SAY IF IT IS MENTAL ILLNESS IT CAN BE EXTREMELY DEBILITATING AND THE AFFECTED STUDENT WILL LIKELY BE UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS S PROBLEM

IN MY PERSONAL CASE THE STUDENT WAS NOT TREATED UNTIL HE WAS FOUND INJURED WANDERING AROUND THE CITY WITH NO IDEA WHAT HE WAS DOING OUR WHERE HE WAS HIS BANK ACCOUNT HAD BEEN DRAINED BY FRIENDS THAT TOOK ADVANTAGE OF HIS FRAGILE STATE GOOD LUCK I HOPE YOUR CASE TURNS OUT BETTER
I WOULD EMAIL HIM TO EXPLAIN THAT IT REALLY ISN'T YOUR FIELD CONSEQUENTLY HE SHOULD CONTACT SOMEONE WITH EXPERTISE IN THAT SPECIFIC AREA IF HE WANTS FEEDBACK
I LIKE THE DESCRIPTION U VERYLITTLE GAVE IT'S SORT OF BROAD BUT ACCURATE IF HE SHE IS RIGHT ABOUT YOUR STUDENT JUST BEING NAIVE IT'S WORTH SITTING DOWN AND TALKING TO THEM FOR A WHILE I'VE HAD THIS HAPPEN TO ME BEFORE WITH STUDENTS AND OLDER PEOPLE AND IT'S TRUE YOUNGER STUDENTS MIGHT JUST BE NAIVE ABOUT THE FIELD BUT FOR PEOPLE LIKE THAT AS OTHERS HAVE SAID THEY MIGHT BE CURED BY EXPLAINING THE PROBLEMS IN YOUR FIELD AND TRYING TO SHOW WHERE YOUR STUDENT'S IDEAS FALL SHORT IN SOLVING THOSE PROBLEMS THERE'S A SOMETHING TO REMEMBER THOUGH DON'T RIDICULE THEM OUTRIGHT IT'S TRUE SOME CRACKPOTS WON'T LISTEN AND EVEN GO ON TO MISINFORM OTHERS AND THEY MIGHT DESERVE A HARSHER TREATMENT BUT THIS IS A STUDENT SO IT'S WORTH ACTUALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HE OR SHE IS SAYS ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR IDEA IT NOT ONLY SHOWS YOU ARE LISTENING AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND BUT IT WILL OPEN THEM UP TO BEING THE SAME TOWARD YOU THEN YOU CAN SLIP IN YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE STUDENT'S IDEA AND FACTS ABOUT YOUR FIELD I READ SOMEWHERE THAT THIS IS A GENERAL TECHNIQUE YOU CAN USE TO TRY AND CONVINCE SOMEONE OF YOUR POINT LISTEN ASK QUESTIONS DRAW THEM OUT AND MAKE THEM EXPLAIN THEN WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT AND YOU FEEL YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE SAYING AND THEY THINK YOU UNDERSTAND START PUSHING BACK

IF YOU CARE ABOUT TEACHING AND GOOD SCIENCE EDUCATION THIS WOULD BE WORTHWHILE EVEN IF IT IS ONE STUDENT
HOW DO I DEAL WITH SUCH AN INDIVIDUAL CAN THEY BE SAVED IF I NURTURE THEIR PASSIONATE SIDE UNTIL THEIR CRANK SIDE DISAPPEARS

IT'S VERY SIMPLE TELL THE INDIVIDUAL THAT SCIENCE REQUIRES EMPIRICAL TESTABILITY AND FALSIFIABILITY THAT UNTESTED IDEAS ARE ASSUMED TO BE FALSE NOT TRUE THE NULL HYPOTHESIS AND SCIENCE RELIES ON AN ATTITUDE OF SKEPTICISM NOT CREDULOUSNESS

EXPLAIN THAT SCIENTISTS ASSUME IDEAS ARE FALSE UNTIL EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE APPEARS WHILE A PSEUDOSCIENTIST ASSUMES THE OPPOSITE IDEAS ARE TRUE UNTIL PROVEN FALSE THIS MEANS A PSEUDOSCIENTIST ACCEPTS FOR EXAMPLE BIGFOOT BECAUSE BIGFOOT HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN NOT TO EXIST BUT BIGFOOT CANNOT BE PROVEN NOT TO EXIST THAT WOULD REQUIRE PROOF OF A NEGATIVE A LOGICAL ERROR

THE ABOVE LOGICAL ARGUMENT TAKES FIVE MINUTES AND WORKS WITH EVERYONE EXCEPT THE MENTALLY ILL

NOTWITHSTANDING WHAT THEIR POSITING THEIR THEORY TO BE THE FACT THAT YOU MENTIONED THEIR HEALTH AS WELL AS THEIR PARANOIA DO YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF PROBLEMS THEY HAVE PARANOIA IS OFTEN A SYMPTOM OF A MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM AND THIS STUDENT MAY REQUIRE A REFERRAL TO A PSYCHIATRIST MORE THAN THEY MAY REQUIRE SCIENTIFIC GUIDANCE
WHEN I WAS A STUDENT AT PRINCETON THERE WAS A SHELF OF SO-CALLED CRACKPOT BOOKS THAT HAD BEEN SENT TO THE LIBRARY IN FINE HALL I USED TO LOOK AT THESE AND WAS STRUCK HOW MANY WERE REACTIONARY RATHER THAN RADICAL WHY RELATIVITY IS BUNK WHY QUEEN MASCULINE IS INCORRECT WHY EINSTEIN WAS WRONG ETC VERY FEW CONTAINED TRULY NEW IDEAS AS FOR DEALING WITH PEOPLE I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE THEM TO CONTINUE STUDY OF CONVENTIONAL SCIENCE AND IT WILL ONLY HELP YOU DEVELOP YOUR IDEAS
SEND YOUR STUDENT HERE
THAT THEY ARE TAKING AN INTRODUCTORY COURSE IN THE FIELD IS VERY POSITIVE I THINK PERHAPS THEY'VE BUILT THEIR CASTLE IN THE AIR AND ARE NOW TRYING TO BUILD THE FOUNDATIONS FOR IT AS AN OUTSIDER TO VARIOUS FIELDS I'VE THOUGHT UP SOME PRODUCTS IN MY CASE AS WELL AND GOING TO SCHOOL TO LEARN ABOUT THE RELATED FIELDS TO DEVELOP IT IT IS I THINK THE SANEST THING ONE CAN DO

WHAT HELPS ME IS TRYING TO BREAK THE IDEA DOWN INTO ITS MANY COMPONENTS AND TRYING TO DEVELOP OR DISPROVE THOSE SEPARATELY
ONE THING WHICH I THINK NEEDS TO BE EMPHASIZED MORE IS THAT YOU ARE OBLIGATED TO REVIEW PERSONAL THEORIES FOR YOUR STUDENTS YOUR JOB ENTAILS HELPING THEM WITH CONCEPTS COVERED IN CLASS BUT ANYTHING BEYOND THAT IS UP TO YOU

IF YOU DECIDE TO DO IT JUDGING BY HOW THESE THINGS WORK IN PHYSICS THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS IT COULD PLAY OUT THE STUDENT COULD BE GENUINELY CURIOUS ABOUT THE FIELD AND RECEPTIVE TO CRITICAL FEEDBACK ABOUT THEIR IDEAS IN THAT CASE YES YOU CAN PROBABLY NURTURE THEIR PASSIONATE SIDE AS YOU SAID AND TEACH THEM SOMETHING ABOUT HOW RESEARCH IN YOUR FIELD WORKS OR THEY COULD BE CONVINCED THEY'VE STUMBLED ONTO THE TRUTH WHICH IS BEING SUPPRESSED BY A WORLDWIDE CONSPIRACY OF SCIENTISTS AND IF YOU TELL THEM ANYTHING LESS THAN THAT THEIR IDEA IS BRILLIANT AND GROUNDBREAKING IN THEIR MIND YOU BECOME THE EMBODIMENT OF THAT WORLDWIDE CONSPIRACY AND OF COURSE THERE'S A WHOLE SPECTRUM OF POSSIBLE RESPONSES IN BETWEEN

NOW IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THAT THIS STUDENT IS SO FAR OFF THE DEEP END THAT YOU PUT YOURSELF IN DANGER BY NOT PRAISING THEIR THEORY THAT'S THE EXTREME END OF THE SPECTRUM BUT THE FACT THAT THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT SOMEONE STEALING THEIR THEORY MAKES ME SKEPTICAL THAT THEY'RE IN THE RECEPTIVE TO CRITICAL FEEDBACK CATEGORY I CAN'T BE SURE I DON'T KNOW THE PERSON THIS IS JUST SOMETHING YOU SHOULD CONSIDER BEFORE DECIDING HOW TO RESPOND TO THEM
IN MY EXPERIENCE CRANKERY ARISES FROM A DEEP NEED TO FEEL SPECIAL UNLESS THIS PSYCHOLOGICAL NEED CAN BE FULFILLED IN SOME OTHER WAY THE CRANKERY WILL CONTINUE
SEEMS LIKE YOU HAVE A FEW OPTIONS HERE COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT THE CRANK IN QUESTION IS A STUDENT
AS AN EDUCATOR THERE'S A LEVEL OF DUTY YOU HAVE TO TALK TO THIS STUDENT AND TRY TO CLARIFY CORRECT THE STUDENT'S CRANK THEORY
THAT BEING SAID CRANKS ARE A HUGE PAIN YOU CAN PROVIDE THEM WITH ALL THE EVIDENCE ALL THE COMPELLING ARGUMENTS ALL THE LOGIC YOU POSSIBLY CAN BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IF THEY ARE A CRANK THEY'RE DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO ACCEPT IT

AS ONE OF MY SENIOR COLLEAGUES TOLD ME WHEN I FIRST ASKED HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM AT SOME POINT YOU JUST NEED TO WALK AWAY
DON'T DISCOURAGE IMAGINATION OUR IMAGINATION PROVES WE DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING LISTENING WILL LET THEIR THOUGHTS OUT AND THEY'LL PROBABLY START THINKING DIFFERENTLY ONCE THEY DIG THEIR HOLE IT'S KINDA LIKE VERBAL WRITING SOME OF US NEED TO LET IT OUT SOME OF US ARE SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW WHERE THESE THINGS COME FROM
A LOT OF COMMENTS HERE ARE QUITE SCATHING IN THEIR VIEWS OF YOUNG CRANKS AND EVEN GOING SO FAR AS TO CALL IT A MENTAL PROBLEM

I FEEL THAT COULD BE UNFAIR AS A TEENAGER I WOULD VORACIOUSLY READ ABOUT PHYSICS AND FORM MY OWN THEORIES I EVEN WROTE ONE UP ONCE AND SENT IT TO STEPHEN HAWKING AND NATURE I REALLY WISH I HAD A COPY NOW SINCE I'VE COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN IT I KNOW OF OTHERS WHO DID THE SAME SORT OF THING IT IS JUST A WAY OF EXPLORING WHAT WE ARE LEARNING PERHAPS COUPLED WITH DREAMS OF GRANDEUR

SO I'D PRAISE HIS LEARNING AND THINKING BUT ENCOURAGE HIM TO LEARN MORE AND TELL HIM NOT TO EXPECT TO PUBLISH UNTIL HE AT LEAST HAS A DEGREE IN THE SUBJECT HE WILL NEED THAT TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT IT AND HAVE IT ACCEPTED BY HIS PEERS WHICH CAN BE HARD EVEN WHEN YOU ARE A PROFESSIONAL AND YOU ARE RIGHT HE'LL ALSO NEED IT TO DETERMINE THE THEORIES STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES HIMSELF GETTING HIM TO SLOW DOWN AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HE WON'T BE GETTING THIS YEAR'S NOBEL PRIZE IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

IF YOU SEE ERRORS I GUESS YOU CAN POINT THEM OUT BUT I LACK ENOUGH CONTEXT TO SAY ANY MORE ABOUT THAT

IF YOU DO WANT TO DISCUSS WITH HIM ABOUT HIS WORK THEN PLEASE TAKE THIS ADAGE FOR HELP PEOPLE BELIEVE IN THINGS THEY UNDERSTAND TO BE TRUE AND THINGS THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND AS FALSE

HE I'M ASSUME IT'S MALE WILL PROBABLY GLOSS OVER ANYTHING YOU HAVE TO SAY BECAUSE HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND IT AND WILL HAMMER HIS IDEAS TO OVERPOWER ANY OBJECTIONS YOU HAVE

IN SIMILAR SITUATIONS THAT I'VE BEEN IN I WOULD STAY ON ONE TOPIC EVEN ONE THEOREM IDEA AND POUND AWAY AT IT UNTIL HE ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDS IT THEN TALK ABOUT HOW HIS WORK CONTRADICTS IT HE WILL NEVER BELIEVE HIS WORK CONTRADICTS ANYTHING BECAUSE THE THING IT CONTRADICTS HE DOESN'T ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND

THIS IS FROM MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IMMOV
I WOULD BE VERY CAREFUL HERE TO DETERMINE IF THE PERSON IS LIKE ACTUALLY CRAZY AS IN SCHIZOPHRENIC

OTHERWISE I'D TREAT THEM LIKE ANYONE ELSE
FROM ANOTHER REPLY

MORE PRAGMATICALLY TELL THEM ABOUT SABINE TALK TO A PHYSICIST SERVICE

I WAS GOING TO MENTION THIS

YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC OBLIGATION TO HELP WITH CLASSWORK AS A TA BUT OUTSIDE OF THAT YOUR EXPERTISE SHOULD BE WORTH SOMETHING MAYBE THIS PERSON'S A HONEST TO GOODNESS CRANK OR MAYBE THEY'RE CONFUSED ABOUT SOMETHING AND THEY THINK IN THEIR CONFUSION THEY'VE SEEN SOMETHING THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVEN'T

AT THE END OF THE DAY IF I WERE TO COME TO YOU WITH A PHYSICS PAPER THAT TOUCHED UPON YOUR FIELD AND ASKED YOU TO CHECK MY WORK I'D EXPECT YOU TO BE COMPENSATED IN SOME WAY FOR IT TELL THIS PERSON THAT YOU HAVE A LOT ON YOUR PLATE AND IF THEY'RE SERIOUS ABOUT YOU LOOKING AT IT THEN IT WILL BE X PER HOUR OF YOUR EARNEST WORK

TL R AS MY GRANDPA SAID IF YOU'RE GOOD AT SOMETHING NEVER DO IT FOR FREE
JUST TRY TO BE OBJECTIVE IT'S YOUR JOB TO EDUCATE THEM ON THE CLASS THEY ARE IN NOT TO CHANGE THEIR WORLD-VIEW IMAGINE THAT THEY JUST EMAILED THE TEXTBOOK IF YOU ARE WELL-VERSED IN YOUR FIELD YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO CORRECT ANY MISINTERPRETATIONS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS CLASS WITHOUT MAKING IT PERSONAL
AUH THOUGHT THIS WAS THE TITLE OF AN R DOGSLEEP STORY AT FIRST ANYHOW THIS SOUNDS LIKE A BIT MORE DELICATE AND SERIOUS THAN YOUR REGULAR DISMISSABLE QUANTUM WOO
HELP IF NOT A PSYCHOLOGIST CAN YOU CONFRONT IT AND HAVE THIS THEORY PREDICT SOMETHING SCIENCE PREDICTS NOT JUST STATES THE REASON FOR ITS CREDIBILITY

ALL THE BEST TO YOU AND GOOD ON YOU FOR CARING ABOUT THIS
DAMN THIS COMMENT SECTION IS ENTERTAINING AS HELL LOVE ME SOME COMMENT SCORE BELOW THRESHOLD
CHECK OUT

IT IS GETTING POPULAR ON R MATH AND SEEMS TO BE RELATED TO YOUR PROBLEM
I'D SHOW INTEREST AND THEN AS YOU GET TO KNOW THEM AND THEIR WORK YOU'LL BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY IF THEY ARE CRAZY OBSESSED
I THINK DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH TIME YOU HAVE TRYING TO EXPLAIN WHY THEIR THEORY AND METHOD OF OBTAINING THIS THEORY IS BS COULD BE THE BEST THING

I THINK ITS BEST NOT TO THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT ALL THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF DOING THE BEST THING JUST BECAUSE ITS PROBABLY IMPOSSIBLE AND AT BEST YOU'RE JUST TRYING HARD TO NOT HURT THIER FEELINGS

IF IT WAS ME THEN SINCE THEY'RE A STUDENT AND NOT SOME RANDOM CRANK OFF THE STREET YOU EMAILED ID TRY AND EXPLAIN THE TRUTH OF THE SITUATION

I THINK WITH SUCH CRANK THEORIES IT CAN BE HELPFUL TO POINT OUT THAT EITHER THEIR THEORY IS NOT TESTABLE OR THAT IT GIVES NO PREDICTIONS YOU CAN MEASURE

SUCH AS IF I POSTULATE THAT THE LAWS OF THE UNIVERSE ARE ACTUALLY SIMPLY THE WILL OF SENTIENT UNICORN IN A PARALLEL DIMENSION YOU COULD ASK WELL HOW COULD WE TEST THIS OR ASSUMING THIS THEORY IS TRUE WHAT DOES IT PREDICT AND THUS HOW WOULD WE GO ABOUT MEASURING THIS

AND THEN PERHAPS AS THEY REALISE THAT THIER THEORY CANNOT DO ANY OF THESE THINGS YOU COULD POINT OUT THAT THIS IS WHY ITS NOT A SCIENTIFIC THEORY AND THUS USELESS AND THUS AN ARBITRARY IMAGINATION


I ALWAYS LIKE PHYSICS ARTICLES LIKE THIS SIMPLE BUT REALLY INTERESTING
IGNORING ALL AERODYNAMIC INTERACTIONS OF COURSE IF YOU KNOW AT LEAST THE VELOCITY OF THE WIND WHICH ISN'T UNIFORM AND CHANGES BASED ON A BUNCH OF FACTORS YOU CAN MAYBE GUESS WHERE THE BULLET WILL LAND THE BULLET HAS A SMALL CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA WITH RESPECT TO THE VELOCITY VECTOR AND WITH RESPECT TO ANY VECTOR ORTHOGONAL TO THE VELOCITY VECTOR SO DRAG WON'T BE MUCH BUT GIVEN THE DISTANCE THE BULLET TRAVELS A SMALL INPUT OF FORCE WILL GREATLY AFFECT THE TRAJECTORY

EDIT ACTUALLY THEY BRING THIS UP AT THE END OH WELL
FROM THIS ANALYSIS YOU COULD HAVE THE SAME RESULT BY BENDING FORWARD AND HAVE YOUR BODY OVER THE CENTER OF MASSACHUSETTS

BUT THIS DOES NOT WORK
IT SOUNDS LIKE PHYSICS GRADUATE SCHOOL IS FOR YOU

THE BACHELOR'S SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO GET YOU SOMEWHERE IN INDUSTRY THAT YOU'D RATHER BE
I HAVEN'T HAD ANY OF YOUR EXPERIENCES BUT I KNOW THAT DEPRESSION DURING UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES IS NOT UNCOMMON IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU OUGHT TO TAKE A BREAK FROM PHYSICS IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT ANYMORE I CAN'T IMAGINE GOING TO GRADUATE SCHOOL IS GOING TO HELP BUT DON'T FEAR IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'VE WASTED YOUR TIME PHYSICS BACHELOR DEGREES ARE STILL AMONG THE HIGHEST PAYING BACHELOR DEGREES AND THAT'S INCLUDING PEOPLE WHO USE THEIR DEGREES TO GET JOBS IN FIELDS COMPLETELY UNRELATED TO PHYSICS HIGHEST EARNING BACHELOR DEGREES

SO EVEN IF YOU DON'T FEEL ALL THAT INTO PHYSICS ANYMORE DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU'VE WASTED YOUR TIME YOU'VE DEFINITELY MADE A GOOD INVESTMENT EVEN IF YOU DON'T CONTINUE WORKING IN PHYSICS

AS FOR I UNDERSTAND THE PAIN PHYSICS IS VERY BAD AT FUN FACTS BECAUSE THE FACTS ARE EITHER INCREDIBLY INTUITIVE DID YOU KNOW THAT HEAT FLOWS FROM HOT TO COLD THINGS OR ARE COMPLETELY REMOVED FROM EVERYDAY EXPERIENCE AND IN EITHER CASE IT'S VERY HARD TO EXPLAIN THE UNDERLYING PHYSICS CONCEPTS WITHOUT RESORTING TO SIMPLISTIC ANALOGIES WHICH ALWAYS GIVE PEOPLE THE WRONG IDEA THIS IS JUST AN UNFORTUNATE FACT OF PHYSICS THOUGH
I'M A PHYSICIST THAT HAS BEEN WORKING AS AN EE FOR YEARS AND AN ADJUNCT UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR FOR I'VE BEEN TEACHING AT GRAD UNDERGRAD LEVELS AND I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO WANT TO QUIT PHYSICS

I WOULD SUGGEST YOU GET A JOB AT THE TUTORING CENTER HELPING OTHERS YOU WILL GET SOME HIGHLY NEEDED PERSPECTIVE ON HOW HARD IT IS TO FIRST LEARN A CONCEPT SOME SERIOUSLY NEEDED SOCIAL INTERACTION WITH OTHER MAJORS AND YOU WILL GET TO REALIZE THAT YOU ACTUALLY KNOW A THAT IS A UNIT OF MEASURE ABOUT A LOT OF COOL THINGS IF YOU WERE MY STUDENT I WOULD LET YOU TEACH AN ENTIRE CLASSICAL

BEST WISHES
I THINK THESE ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS TO SOME DEGREE BUT ALSO THE LENS WHICH YOU ARE LOOKING AT EVERYTHING THROUGH IS CLEARLY QUITE DARK

IT'S TRUE PHYSICS HAS A BAD REPUTATION AMONG MANY YOUNG PEOPLE ESPECIALLY STUDENTS OF HIGHER ED BUT TALKING ABOUT YOUR JOB IS NORMALLY POOR FORM IN ANY SOCIAL SITUATION I SINCERELY DOUBT THOSE OTHER PEOPLE ARE MORE INTERESTING BECAUSE OF THEIR COLLEGE MAJOR THEY ARE PROBABLY JUST BETTER ROUNDED AND LESS JADED INDIVIDUALS

2 THIS IS AN EXTREMELY PERSONAL THING THE THING TO ENJOY IS THE LEARNING AND PRIDE THAT COMES WITH GOING THROUGH ALL THE STEPS NEEDED TO PERFORM A SCIENTIFICALLY VALID MEASUREMENT IF YOU CAN NOT FIND PLEASURE IN THAT THEN I AGREE THAT CLEARLY LAB WORK IS NOT FOR YOU HOWEVER EVERYONE FEELS LIKE THAT SOMETIMES AND IN MY EXPERIENCE STEPPING AWAY FOR A WHILE REALLY HELPED ME APPRECIATE MY WORK

THIS IS TRUE TO SOME DEGREE FOR ANY KNOWLEDGE WORK BUT THERE ARE WITHIN PHYSICS THAT ARE MORE SOCIAL I WORK ON AN LOC DETECTOR AND THERE IS BASICALLY NOTHING I DO ALONE OF COURSE MY ACTUAL WORK MOSTLY CODING READING AND MAKING PRESENTATIONS IS PERFORMED BY MYSELF BUT THERE ARE ALWAYS AT LEAST PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN WHAT I'M DOING AND AGAIN IN MY EXPERIENCE IF YOU'RE A NICE PERSON THEY ARE HAPPY TO TALK I DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE PART OF A COMMUNITY WHEN I WAS WORKING IN QUANTUM INFORMATION THEORY HOWEVER I FELT A LOT MORE ISOLATED MY INSTITUTION DOES NOT HAVE MANY PEOPLE WORKING IN THAT FIELD

THIS IS ABOUT THE SAME AS 2

WOMEN IN PHYSICS ARE A RARE BREED THIS IS A SAD SAD TRUTH AND I SINCERELY AGREE THAT NOT HAVING WOMEN AROUND TO INTERACT WITH IS QUITE DAMAGING TO THE MALE PSYCHE AND FURTHER IT TENDS TO MAKE YOU SOMEWHAT AWKWARD AND NERVOUS AROUND WOMEN WHICH IN TURN MAKES WOMEN UNCOMFORTABLE AROUND YOU THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM BUT IT'S NOT THAT RARE IN ANY FIELD THAT YOU WILL NEED TO FIND HOBBIES AND CONNECT WITH WOMEN OUTSIDE OF WORK AS FAR AS OTHER PEOPLE BEING BORING I DISAGREE WITH THAT AND I WOULD GUESS YOU ARE LIKELY JUDGING BOOKS BY THEIR COVER OF COURSE MOST OF THE PEOPLE YOU MEET ARE GOING TO BE INTO PHYSICS IF YOU WENT INTO A GYM TO MEET PEOPLE YOU'D FIND THEY ARE LIKELY MOSTLY INTO ATHLETICS YOUR JOB AND YOUR SOCIAL CIRCLE DO NOT NEED TO BE ONE IN THE SAME FINDING OTHER HOBBIES AND FRIENDS WILL BE AN IMPORTANT THING TO DO REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU WORK PUT YOUR SOCIAL NEEDS ON PAR WITH YOUR PROFESSIONAL NEEDS

THAT IS LEARNING IT IS TOUGH AND TAKES A LOT OUT OF YOU THE THING THAT MAKES EVERY PHYSICIST SPECIAL IS THAT THEY LEARN TO MANAGE THAT ANXIETY KEEP THOSE PROBLEMS WITH YOU AND DON'T GIVE UP ON THEM THERE'S NO SHAME IN NOT KNOWING HOW TO DO A PROBLEM IF YOU ARE WORKING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ABOUT IT IS CONFUSING YOU IF YOU LEARN TO DO THAT YOU WILL BE A VERY USEFUL INDIVIDUAL

PHYSICS IS HARD NO ONE CAN REALLY KEEP ALL THE STEPS TO COMPLICATED WORK IN THEIR HEAD AT ONCE FURTHER NOT EVERYONE IS A GREAT TEACHER AND AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU WILL NEED TO LEARN HOW TO LEARN YOURSELF I WILL MAKE AN ASIDE TO MENTION THAT WHEN A PROFESSOR SAYS X IS TRIVIAL VERY OFTEN THEY MEAN THERE'S SOME TRICK TO THIS THAT I DON'T REMEMBER I AGREE WITH YOU THAT THIS IS A HORRIBLE HORRIBLE PRACTICE AND IS UNBEARABLY DISCOURAGING TO STUDENTS DO NOT LET ARROGANT PEOPLE WITH FRAGILE EGOS MAKE YOU THINK YOU'RE STUPID LEARN TO ASK GOOD QUESTIONS AND YOU WILL SEE THAT THE PROBLEMS YOU HAVE WILL STUMP THE PROFESSOR AS WELL TIMES OUT OF AND THE OTHER TIMES YOU'LL LEARN SOMETHING

WE DO NOT GET SUCH HORRIBLE PAY FOR DOING A JOB THAT GIVES YOU SUCH INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM NOT TO MENTION THERE ARE MANY HIGH PAYING PRIVATE INDUSTRY JOBS PHYSICISTS CAN HOLD IF THEY EXIT ACADEMIA AT ANY POINT ALONG THEIR CAREER OF COURSE YOUR JOB WILL NOT ALWAYS FEEL FULFILLING BUT DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE TO THINK IT'S AN SORT OF DEAL SOME JOBS ARE MORE FULFILLING THAN OTHERS

IN ANY CASE IT'S PERFECTLY REASONABLE TO REALIZE THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT CAREER FOR YOU I HAVE WANTED TO LEAVE PHYSICS BEFORE AND WENT SO FAR AS GOING ON A LEAVE OF ABSENCE FROM SCHOOL TO FOCUS ON LOOKING FOR A JOB IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE AND I EVENTUALLY REALIZED I HAD BEEN TAKING MANY THINGS I LOVED ABOUT MY LIFE FOR GRANTED I WOULD DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMEND YOU CONTINUE IN THIS FIELD IF YOU THINK THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE YOU'D RATHER BE DOING YOU'RE VERY YOUNG YOU SHOULD BE EXPLORING A BIT PHYSICS WILL ALWAYS BE THERE IF YOU WANT TO COME BACK
WAIT UNTIL YOU GET INTO THE REAL WORLD BUD YOU FEEL INADEQUATE BECAUSE YOU ARE AROUND INCREDIBLY INTELLIGENT PEOPLE DOING INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT MIND EXERCISES TO PRODUCE INCREDIBLY SCIENTIFIC RESULTS ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU DROP OUT YOU MAY NEVER BE INTELLECTUALLY STIMULATED TO THAT EXTENT AGAIN

TAKE IT FROM SOMEONE WHO GRADUATED WITH A DEGREE IN ASTROPHYSICS AND ONLY LASTED MONTHS IN A COFFEE SHOP BEFORE JUMPING RIGHT BACK IN YOU CAN ALSO TALK TO MY BUDDY WHO IS MINDLESSLY SCREENING DATA AT GOOGLE GET THE MASTER'S DO SOMETHING COOL IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO BE IN PHYSICS SPECIFICALLY THINK OF YOUR MASTER'S DEGREE AS PROOF THAT YOU CAN SIT DOWN WITH DIFFICULT AND NUANCED PROBLEMS AND PROVIDE GOOD SOLUTIONS IN A FIXED TIME FRAME
MAYBE YOU ARE NOT TALKING TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE PHYSICS IS INTERESTING EVEN FOR PEOPLE MORE OR LESS SO THEN OTHER SUBJECTS

2 I THINK MOST STUDENTS FEEL THAT WAY

HONESTLY PHYSICS PEOPLE ARE NOT THE MOST OUTGOING PEOPLE FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN AND LOOKING AT MYSELF BUT THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT THERE IS NO SOCIAL INTERACTIONS IN PHYSICS COMMUNITIES WHETHER IN LAB GROUPS OR THE MAJOR AS A WHOLE ITS DEPENDENT ON US

SOMETHINGS YOU CAN'T REALLY HELP

WEIRDLY ENOUGH THE PHYSICS DEPARTMENT AT MY SCHOOL SOME OF THE MOST HELPFUL AND ENJOYABLE TO LEARN FROM I'VE ONLY REALLY HAD THAT PROBLEM YOU DESCRIBED WITH MATH PROFESSORS BUT THAT JUST ME

YOU SEEM TO BE AHEAD OF ME FROM AT THAT POINT SO I CAN'T COMMENT BUT I DO SOMETIMES WONDER WHY PHYSICS I GUESS ITS BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A WIDE AND VARIED FIELD THAT'S ITS HARD TO STRAY AWAY FROM PRAGMATICALLY THOUGH IT'S ALSO NICE THAT YOU CAN PROBABLY BULLSHIT YOUR PHYSICS DEGREE TO GET A PROGRAMMING ENGINEERING AND OTHER NON PHYSICS BUT TECHNICAL JOBS SO AT WORST GETTING A PHYSICS DEGREE DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A COMPLETE WASTE PERHAPS TRY LOOKING INTO WHAT FUELED YOUR DRIVE IN THE FIRST PLACE OR FIND SOMETHING TO REINVIGORATE YOUR PASSION THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONTINUE WITH YOUR PATHOLOGY
PROFESSORS TEACHERS SEEM UNINTERESTED AND ARE REALLY BAD IN EXPLAINING STUFF I KEEP HEARING STUFF LIKE OH THAT'S TRIVIAL THAT'S TRIVIAL THAT'S TRIVIAL TRIVIAL TRIVIAL TRIVIAL I'LL SKIP THAT EVERYTHING IS TRIVIAL AND EASY TO THEM AND THEY DO NOT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S DEFINITELY NOT TO THEIR STUDENTS SERIOUSLY IT IS NOT UNCOMMON TO HAVE A 2 HOUR CLASS AND OF THE STUDENTS INCLUDING ME WALKING OUT OKE I HAD NO IDEA WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE LAST MINUTES GUESS I'LL HAVE TO STUDY IT ALL BY MYSELF AT HOME AND HOPE I UNDERSTAND LITERALLY EVERY DAMN TIME AND ASKING THE TEACHER TO EXPLAIN IT BETTER NEVER HELPS AS THEIR EXPLANATIONS ARE OFTEN JUST BAD THEY JUST MAKE YOU FEEL DUMB AND IT'S FRUSTRATING TO BE HONEST

UGH I REMEMBER THIS
IT'S AMAZING HOW NEARLY EVERYONE OF THESE POINTS IS THE TOTAL OPPOSITE OF MY EXPERIENCE I GUESS IT DEPENDS WHERE YOU LIVE AND THE UNIVERSITY WORKPLACE CULTURE
I STOPPED STUDYING PHYSICS AFTER I GOT MY BACHELORS B SOUTH USA SYSTEM I THOUGHT I WASN'T AS GOOD AS OTHERS IN MY CLASS DESPITE GETTING GOOD GRADES AND I DIDN'T WANT TO LIVE THE LIFE OF AN ACADEMIC IT SEEMED TOO ISOLATED TOO UNCERTAIN AND YEAH TOO FULL OF A PARTICULAR TYPE OF ASIAN WHITE GUY I WENT INTO THE BUSINESS WORLD INSTEAD AND EVENTUALLY GOT AN MBA

NOW YEARS AFTER GRADUATING I'M SEEING MY CLASSMATES GET PROFESSORSHIPS AND START TO GAIN TRACTION IN THEIR CAREERS DO I REGRET LEAVING THE FIELD SOMETIMES I STILL THINK I WOULD HAVE BEEN UNHAPPY OR A FAILURE AS AN ACADEMIC BUT I HAVE SOME FRIENDS WHO WORK MAINLY ON SPACE MISSIONS WHO SEEM TO HAVE A LOT OF COLLABORATION AND DIVERSITY IN THEIR LIFE ON THE OTHER HAND SOME OF MY FRIENDS DOING YET ANOTHER POSTHOC ARE EARNING OF WHAT I EARNED MY FIRST YEAR OUT OF SCHOOL WHEREAS I HAVE A VERY COMFORTABLE LIFESTYLE STILL THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I ACHINGLY MISS DOING SCIENCE YOU GET TO DISCOVER SOMETHING NOBODY IN THE WORLD KNEW BEFORE AND THAT IS AN AMAZING FEELING IT'S COOL TO DO BUSINESS STUFF AND HAVE IMMEDIATE TANGIBLE IMPACT ON THE WORLD BUT IT'S NOT REALLY THE SAME PLUS YOUR MATH AND PHYSICS SKILLS ATROPHY PRETTY FAST IF YOU AREN'T USING THEM SO YOU SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE FEELING LIKE YOU'RE SIGNIFICANTLY STUPIDER THAN YOU WERE AS AN UNDERGRADUATE

THE THING THAT STANDS OUT AS A RED FLAG TO ME IS YOUR IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO PHYSICS AS A CAREER YOU'RE GOING TO RAPIDLY REACH A POINT WHERE YOU ARE THE EXPERT ON SOMETHING MEANING THAT HOWEVER MUCH COLLABORATION YOU DO THERE'S NOBODY ELSE WHO KNOWS HOW TO SOLVE THE PARTICULAR PROBLEM YOU'RE WORKING ON YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO LOOK UP ANSWERS THIS IS FOR EVERYONE BUT TO BE SUCCESSFUL YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO THRIVE IN THAT KIND OF ENVIRONMENT IF YOU FIND THIS VERY DIFFICULT WITH JUST PROBLEM SETS AS OPPOSED TO GETTING STUCK USUALLY PRODUCING THE GOOD KIND OF FRUSTRATION THAT MAKES YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE TEMPERAMENT FOR A CAREER IN PHYSICS
MAN I CAN CERTAINLY RELATE
I ALSO LOST INTEREST HAD DEPRESSION DURING STUDIES ACTUALLY I WAS ONE STEP AWAY FROM COMPLETELY CHANGING MY CAREER DECISION BUT IN THE 3RD YEAR I GOT A STUDENT RESEARCHER POSITION AT THE RESEARCH REACTOR IN MY COUNTRY THE SALARY WAS OK TO GET THROUGH THE REMAINING YEARS OF THE UNI HOWEVER THE EXPERIENCE WAS PRICELESS AND I FINALLY STARTED TO LOVE PHYSICS AGAIN NOW I WOULDN T CHANGE MY DECISION FOR ANYTHING SINCE AS A FRESH GRADUATE I HAD 2 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN MY FIELD I GOT AN IAEA FELLOWSHIP AFTER THE UNIVERSITY AND NOW ALSO ITER FELLOWSHIP AT THE MOMENT I AM WORKING ON VARIOUS PROJECTS FOR ITER FOR EU DOMESTIC AGENCY IN THE FIELD OF NEUTRONICS AND DIAGNOSTICS IT WASN T EASY I GAD CLOSE TO FREE TIME DURING STUDIES HOWEVER WHEN YOU WORK ON A CHALLENGING PROJECT I BELIEVE IT WAS WORTH IT
I LOVED NUMBER HAHA OUR ENTIRE CLASS ALWAYS RANTED ABOUT EXPERIMENTAL ERROR

MY EXPERIENCE WITH PHYSICS FLUCTUATED WITH THE QUALITY OF CLASSMATES I HAD IN MY FIRST YEAR I HATED IT BECAUSE ALL THE OTHER STUDENT IN THE MAJOR REALLY DIDNT GEL WITH ME THEN THE NEXT YEAR WE HAD TWO NEW STUDENT WHO KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK WITH RECRUITING NEW STUDENTS AND THE ENTIRE CLASS ACTUALLY BECAME A REALLY CLOSE FRIEND GROUP YEAH HOURS A WEEK OF WORD SUCKS BUT IT SUCKS LESS WHEN THERE ARE OF YOUR FRIENDS PULLING AN WITH YOU

AND YEAH THERE'S DEFINITELY A DEPRESSION MOLDED IN WITH THAT BUT THE DEGREE YOU'LL HAVE IS ARGUABLY THE MOST VALUABLE BS YOU CAN HAVE THAT TELLS EMPLOYERS YOU CAN CRITICALLY THINK AND PROBLEM SOLVE


YEAH SO MY ADVICE WOULD BE TO TRY AND MAKE FRIENDS WITH SOME OF THE OTHER STUDENTS OR RECRUIT NEW COOLER STUDENTS OR JOIN ANOTHER STUDENT ORGANIZATION OF SIMILAR INTERESTS TO YOUR SO YOU HAVE SOME SOCIAL LIFE TO LOOK FORWARD TO ONCE YOU GET OUT OF CLASSICAL FOR ME IT WAS A FRATERNITY NOTHING FEEDS THE DEPRESSIVE CYCLE MORE THAN JUST DOING WORK AND NEVER HAVING ANYTHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO EVEN IF IT'S JUST WATCHING SPORTS WITH FRIENDS ONE DAY OUT OF THE WEEK
READ SOME POPULAR PHYSICS BOOKS A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME DARK MATTER AND THE DINOSAURS AND PICK UP SOME TALKING POINTS FROM THEM THOSE BOOKS ARE DESIGNED TO ENGAGE THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND THEY WORK WELL FOR THAT DO NOT MENTION EQUATIONS WHEN TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO DO NOT STUDY PHYSICS

2 YOU DON'T NEED TO WORK IN A LABORATORY HIGH ENERGY AND ASTRO FOLKS GENERALLY DON'T WORK IN LABS OR YOU CAN SPECIALIZE IN SIMULATIONS IN ANY FIELD

TABLETOP GAMES BEER WILL FIX THAT HAVE YOU EVER PLAYED MUNCHKIN

IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE HAD SHITTY PROFESSORS YOU SHOULD PICK YOUR UPPER LEVEL CLASSES BASED ON HOW WELL RESPECTED THE PROFESSOR IS AMONG STUDENTS THAT MATTERS MORE THAN THE SUBJECT MATERIAL IT'S A WASTE OF TIME TO TAKE ANY CLASS WITH A BAD PROFESSOR YOU COULD JUST AS WELL READ THE TEXTBOOK ON YOUR OWN TIME

I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOUR OTHER POINTS THOSE ARE YOUR VALID OPINIONS TALK TO YOUR ADVISOR ABOUT WHAT CAREER YOU SHOULD PREPARE FOR CONSIDER CHANGING TO A COMSCI OR ENGINEERING MAJOR

WELL SO I AM IN GRADUATE SCHOOL NEAR COMPLETION COUPLE OF YEARS I DONT THINK I WILL STAY IN ACADEMICS IF YOU HAVE SOME TIME LOOK INTO AP STATISTICS WEBSITES THEY HAVE A LOT OF RELATED JOBS STATS ON VARIOUS PHYSICS GRADUATES BACHELORS MASTERS PHS HAVE TRANSITIONED INTO OTHER FIELDS THEY HAVE COUPLE OF PUBLISHED RESEARCH AS TO WHAT SKILLS AS A PHYSICIST HELPS PEOPLE WHO HAVE TRANSITIONED TO GET SUCCESS AT STUDYING PHYSICS HELPS YOU THINK IN CERTAIN WAY AND MAKES YOU TACKLE PROBLEM IN A DIFFERENT LOGICAL AND EFFICIENT WHICH IS VERY VALUABLE
IT TOOK ME A WHILE YEARS OF GRAD SCHOOL TO REALIZED FEW OF THE POINTS YOU HAVE POINTED OUT PARTLY LACK OF ANY BREAK FROM STUDIES ACADEMIC SECTOR IS TO BLAME BUT I AM PLANNING TO MOVE OUT OF THE ACADEMIC SECTOR AS OF NOW I DIDNT GET ANY INFORMATION ABOUT OTHER JOBS THAN ACADEMICS FROM THE REDDIN SUBREDDIT BUT YA BOTTOM LINE I AM IN GRAD SCHOOL AND I DO AGREE WITH MOST OF THE POINTS YOU POINTED OUT THERE IS ALWAYS A WAY OUT AND YOU DONT HAVE TO STICK WITH IT IF YOU DONT WANT TO PHYSICS PROVIDES YOU VARIOUS SKILLS WHICH ARE ALREADY TO GROW IN YOU EVEN BEFORE YOU REALIZE WHICH ARE VERY VALUABLE

YOUR TIME LEARNING PHYSICS IN SCHOOL WILL LIKELY ONLY BE A SHADE OF YOUR CAREER

BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR CONCLUSIONS
AS A WOMAN WHO JUST RECEIVED HER BACHELOR'S IN PHYSICS I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I HOPE YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SWITCH LABS UNIVERSITIES I SAW SOMEWHERE THAT YOU ARE A EUROPEAN STUDENT SO I AM UNFAMILIAR WITH EUROPEAN GRADUATE STUDIES I AM FROM THE US HOWEVER SINCE IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE STUCK WORKING WITH PHYSICS I HOPE THAT YOU GET THE CHANCE TO EXPERIENCE ANOTHER ATMOSPHERE

I WENT TO A UNIVERSITY WHERE I WAS SURROUNDED BY A MULTITUDE OF FASCINATING PEOPLE WHO PROVIDED ME A VERY FULFILLING SOCIAL LIFE WHILE WE STRUGGLED THROUGH HOMEWORK SETS TOGETHER AND TAUGHT EACH OTHER NEW CONCEPTS THE PROFESSORS DO TEND TO SAY THAT A PROBLEM IS TRIVIAL WHICH CAN BE FRUSTRATING HOWEVER THERE ARE RESOURCES OUT THERE THAT YOU CAN FIND TO GUIDE YOU THROUGH A NEAT TRICK OR PROCESS TO UNDERSTAND THE TRIVIAL PARTS IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO TEACH YOURSELF AND REINFORCE THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU GAIN BY ASKING QUESTIONS TO WHICH YOU'VE GIVEN A LOT OF THOUGHT

ALSO IF YOU ARE ABLE TO SUCCINCTLY DESCRIBE SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON OR WHICH FASCINATES YOU THEN YOU CAN EASILY GET SOMEONE WHO IS NOT FOCUSING ON PHYSICS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND WHY IT'S A BIG DEAL

ONE LAST NOTE THE LAB YOU WORK IN DOES NOT HAVE TO BE SO ANTISOCIAL I WORK IN A BIOPHYSICS LAB AND IT'S A VERY SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT EXPLORE DIFFERENT AREAS AND SEE WHAT YOU CAN FIND
I UNDERSTAND YOUR FEELING AT THE MOMENT IT WAS THE SAME FOR ME ONE YEAR AGO I TOOK A BREAK AND LEAVED PHYSICS FOR ALMOST 2 MONTHS THEN I CAME BACK THE STUDY OF THIS FIELD CAN BE VERY FRUSTRATING SOMETIMES AS YOU MENTIONED NO FUNFACTS IT IS DIFFICULT TO MEET INTERESTING STUDENTS AND SOME TEACHERS ARE VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND TODAY I'M IN MY FIFTH YEAR IN COLLEGE NEXT YEAR I WILL START MY PHD AND THINGS ARE GETTING BETTER HOPE IT WILL BE THE SAME FOR YOU
SORRY FOR MY NOTSOGOOD ENGLISH IT IS NOT MY NATIVE LANGUAGE
I'M ENTERING MY LAST YEAR OF UNDERGRAD AND I'M FEELING THE EXACT SAME WAY LIKE IT WAS EERIE READING THIS DON'T WORRY THERE ARE MANY OTHERS LIKE YOU
OOH BOY YOU SHOULD NOT CONTINUE PHYSICS STUDIES I'M A MATHEMATICS STUDENT AND THE ISSUE IS BASICALLY THE SAME

I'VE HAD THOSE SAME THOUGHTS OF I CAN'T TALK TO ANYONE ABOUT MY FIELD OR NO ONE GIVES ME THE ACCOLADES I WANT BECAUSE NO ONE UNDERSTANDS WHAT I DO AND FOR THAT I TOOK A STEP BACK MY LOVE FOR MATH OVERRIDES EVERY ONE OF THOSE POINTS OF CONTENTION

I CAN'T SAY THE SAME FOR YOU BUT IT REALLY DOES SOUND LIKE PHYSICS IS NOT FOR YOU IT SEEMS THAT YOU REQUIRE A GREAT DEAL OF SOCIAL INTERACTION SOCIAL VALIDATION THAT WOULD BE LOST IF YOU CONTINUE DOWN THIS PATHOLOGY NOTE THIS MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE TRUE SINCE IN GRAD SCHOOL YOU COULD POTENTIALLY MAKE FRIENDS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THE SAME THINGS AS YOU AND CAN GIVE YOU VALIDATION THAT YOU NEED

IT MAY BE DEPRESSION YOU'RE FEELING BUT I'D VENTURE TO SAY IT'S STEMMING FROM SOME SORT OF REGRET YOU HAVE NOW WILL LEAVE UNDERGRAD WITH A DEGREE THAT DIDN'T GIVE YOU WHAT YOU EXPECTED IT SUCKS IT ALSO MAKES ME WONDER WHY YOU WANTED TO STUDY PHYSICS IN THE FIRST PLACE

I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND NOT DOING GRADUATE SCHOOL IF YOU NEED CONVINCING FROM OTHER PEOPLE IF YOU THINK YOU CAN'T DO THIS DON'T DO THIS YOUR PHYSICS DEGREE WILL NOT GO TO WASTE LUCKILY MOST PEOPLE ASSUME PHYSICS STUDENTS ARE OF A PARTICULAR INTELLIGENCE SAME FOR MATH AND YOU CAN BENEFIT FROM THAT HAVING A STEM DEGREE WILL GET YOU A JOB SOMEWHERE IF ACADEMIA IS NOT ON YOUR PLATE CURRENTLY
I DID A DEGREE IN PHYSICS AT A SMALL UNIVERSITY THEN I TOOK A YEAR OFF AND DID A MASTER'S DEGREE IN PHYSICS

IT TAKES SOME TIME TO LEARN HOW TO TALK ABOUT THINGS A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN METAPHYSICS

2 LAB WORK WAS SO INTERESTING I GOT TO USE HIGH VACUUM EQUIPMENT RADIOACTIVE ISOTOPES GAAS LIQUID NITROGEN SOME OF MY FRIENDS DID LASER SPECTROSCOPY THEIR LASERS WERE AMAZING OTHERS DID NMR BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT THAT WAS MOSTLY LOOKING AT COMPUTER SCREENS I GOT TO LEARN SO MANY COOL THINGS ABOUT COMPUTERS EAST G PROGRAMMING APPLE II IN ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE

SOCIAL INTERACTION THIS AGAIN WILL TAKE A FEW MORE YEARS FOR YOU YOU MAY NOT HAVE A LOT OF GOOD INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER PHYSICS STUDENTS BREAK OUT OF YOUR BOX JOIN A ROCK CLIMBING CLUB OR SOMETHING

AH THE RESULTS AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT WAS THE PROBLEM FOR ME YOU SEE I COULD NEVER GET ANYTHING REPRODUCIBLE IT WAS A NIGHTMARE THAT'S WHY I NEVER WENT ON TO DO A PH D

DON'T BE SO STUCK UP

ASSIGNMENTS ARE DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING WORK TOGETHER WITH OTHERS INSTEAD OF THINKING OF THEM AS BORING DOLTS IF YOU ARE NOT INTO PUZZLES AND MENTAL CHALLENGES THEN YOU'RE IN THE WRONG FIELD YOU SHOULD ENJOY PLAYING SODOKU CHESS GO OR OTHER SIMILAR THINGS YOU SHOULD LOVE LEARNING NEW THINGS RESEARCHING THINGS ON YOUR OWN

YES THIS IS SOMETIMES TRUE HOWEVER READ THE TEXT BOOK ALSO FIND A PROFESSOR WHO IS GOOD AND ASK HIM GET A TUTOR SEE

I GOT PAID QUITE WELL WHEN I WORKED AS A TENSE A IN CANADA



IF YOU WANT A JOB IN PHYSICS THEN YOU WILL HAVE TO DO A OR PH D HOWEVER IF YOU ARE GOOD AT PHYSICS AND PROBLEM SOLVING AND FROM YOUR POST I'M NOT AT ALL CONVINCED THAT YOU ARE THEN A PHYSICS DEGREE HAS DONE A GREAT DEAL TO PREPARE YOU FOR A GOOD JOB IN COMPUTER PROGRAMMING YOU WILL GET PAID WELL AS A PROGRAMMER IF YOU GET TO BE ANY GOOD IT INVOLVES VERY SIMILAR SKILLS TO SOLVING PHYSICS PROBLEMS MANY PROGRAMMERS ARE SOCIALLY INEPT SO THAT WILL BE THE SAME AS YOUR CURRENT SITUATION BUT YOU WILL HAVE A GOOD JOB AND IF YOU LIKE LEARNING THINGS YOU CAN ENJOY THE JOB IT CAN TAKE YOU ANYWHERE
DAMN PHYSICS HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY FAVORITE SUBJECT AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN MOST SUCCESSFUL IN PHYSICS COMPARED TO OTHER CLASSES AS WELL HOWEVER I DECIDED TO MAJOR IN BIOCHEMISTRY I'M A JUNIOR NOW AND ALWAYS FIND MYSELF WISHING THAT I HAD CHOSEN PHYSICS READING YOUR COMPLAINTS MAKES ME FEEL SLIGHTLY BETTER ABOUT MY DECISION STILL I'M CONSIDERING DOING BIOPHYSICS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT FOR GRAD SCHOOL BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW FUN THAT WILL BE
MSE IN PHYSICS HERE

AD FIELD OF STUDY DOES NOT MAKE YOU INTERESTING GUY I'D SUGGEST YOU FINDING A HOBBY OR OTHER TOPIC NOT NECESSARILY PHYSICS RELATED OR MAYBE SOMETHING ON THE PHYSICS PHILOSOPHY BORDER ABOUT WHICH YOU CAN TALK FREELY WITH YOUR FRIENDS

AD 2 PHYSICS IS NOT ALWAYS A LABORATORY I SHARE YOUR EXPERIENCE LAB WORK WAS TOO DEMANDING SO I CHOSE COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS TO BE MY BSE SPECIALIZATION AND NUCLEAR PHYSICS ON MSE THIS MEANT MOST OF WORK WAS DATA ANALYSIS SIMULATION PREPARATION ETC I WAS A MEMBER OF BIG EXPERIMENT ALICE WHICH MEANT COLLABORATION WITH LOT OF PEOPLE MAYBE IS THIS YOUR WAY TO GO

AD YEP IT'S JUST PHYSICS BUT STILL YOU CAN DO MORE WORK WHICH REQUIRE PEOPLE INTERACTION LIKE SCIENCE POPULARIZATION

AD UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS THE HARSH TRUTH I THINK YOU SHOULD TRY JOINING BIGGER EXPERIMENT WHICH WILL FORCE COLLABORATION WITH OTHER PEOPLE MAYBE WHEN YOU WILL SEE THE BIGGER PICTURE WITH THE WHOLE TEAM EFFORT THIS WILL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER

AD HOW ABOUT STUDENT CIRCLES ORGANIZATIONS IF YOU HAVE BORING PEOPLE AT YOUR FACULTY TRY FINDING PEOPLE TO SOCIALIZE IN OTHER PLACES PROTID IN MY COUNTRY MOST OF FEMALE STUDENTS WENT TO STUDY OPTICS OPTICAL ELECTRONICS MEDICAL PHYSICS YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND LADIES THERE

AD THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS YOU MAY NOT LIKE IT I DIDN'T LIKE IT AT THAT TIME BUT NOW I THINK I LEARNED A LOT FROM THIS WAY OF STUDYING THIS FORCES YOUR BRAIN TO FIND SOLUTIONS OUT OF THE BOX AND TO GRASP HARD CONCEPTS THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WHICH WILL YOU LEARN DURING YOUR PHYSICS STUDIES PHYSICS GRADUATES ARE VALUABLE ON THE JOB MARKET BECAUSE OF THEIR OUT OF THE BOX THINKING AND ANALYTICAL MINDS IF YOU'RE HAVING HARD TIME DOING IT PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE AND PRACTICE BELIEVE ME PRACTICE WILL MAKE YOU BETTER AT EVERYTHING

AD DID YOU TRY TO ASK OTHER STUDENTS DID YOU TRY TO LEARN IN GROUPS DID YOU TRY TO ASK SOME PHD CANDIDATE ABOUT THE TOPIC I REMEMBER I WAS HAVING TROUBLES WITH SOME TOPIC FROM QUANTUM MECHANICS RELATED WITH ALGEBRA I ASKED MY ELECTRODYNAMICS PROFESSOR BECAUSE I LIKED HIM AND HE WAS EASY GOING PERSON WHICH WAS EAGER TO HELP AND HE EXPLAINED IT TO ME CLEARLY ALWAYS TRY OTHER WAYS

AD PHYSICISTS ARE NOT WELL PAID THIS IS THE REASON WHY I LEFT PHYSICS I AM SOFTWARE DEVELOPER NOW BUT I DON'T REGRET CHOOSING THIS FIELD OF STUDY I'D RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE BECAUSE IT IS KINA EYE-OPENER HM MAYBE IS BETTER WORD

MY OVERALL IMPRESSION IS THAT THE REASON YOU LOST YOUR INTEREST IN PHYSICS IS YOUR APPROACH I KNOW THAT IT IS EASIER WHEN THERE ARE PEOPLE AROUND WHICH SHARE YOUR MINDSET BUT NONETHELESS YOU SHOULDN'T GIVE UP TRY FINDING PEOPLE WHICH CAN HELP YOU YOU CAN FIND THEM IN EAST G THE STUDENT CIRCLES TRY APPROACHING PROFESSORS WITH QUESTIONS YES I KNOW THAT IT MIGHT BE HARD TRY TO MAKE YOUR QUESTIONS MORE PRECISE I EAST INSTEAD I DON'T UNDERSTAND ASK HOW CAN I GET INFO ABOUT THIS X IN Y HOW IT WAS DERIVED THIS WILL LESSEN YOUR CHANCES TO BE PUT OFF BY A PROFESSOR DIG DEEPER AND DEEPER TRY TO UNDERSTAND I KNOW THAT IT WILL BE HARD IT WILL BE DEPRESSING BUT I FOUND THE PRIZE AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS HOLE MOST REWARDING SATISFACTION FROM UNDERSTANDING HARD CONCEPTS THIS WAS IMPROVING MY MORALE THROUGH WHOLE STUDIES

REGARDING THE INTERNSHIP JOB YES THE SITUATION WILL CHANGE FOR BETTER BUT BEWARE THERE ARE SHITTY INTERNSHIPS JOBS OUT THERE WHEN YOU FIND ONE QUIT AND GET ANOTHER YOU CAN BE JUMPING BETWEEN THEM FOR A YEAR TWO OR THREE BUT DON'T GIVE UP THIS IS IMPORTANT EXPERIENCE WHICH WILL ALLOW YOU TO DISTINGUISH WHAT IS GOOD OR BAD FOR YOU

IF MY POST SOUNDED OFFENSIVE SORRY I DIDN'T MEAN THAT IT'S JUST YOU NEED SOME STRONG ADVICE A KICK IN YOUR BUTT TO GET THINGS TOGETHER GET OUT OF YOUR CHANDRA AND START DOING THINGS WHICH WILL MAKE YOUR LIFE BETTER GOOD LUCK MAN YOU'RE NOT ALONE
RECENTLY GRADUATED PARTICLE PHYSICS PHD HERE

NOBODY EVER UNDERSTANDS OR IS INTERESTED IN WHAT I AM SAYING IF I BRING UP PHYSICS IN CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHERS PEOPLE WHO STUDIED GEOLOGY MEDICINE BUSINESS ETC ALWAYS DO SEEM TO HAVE INTERESTING SUBJECTS TO BRING UP

I ACTUALLY HAVE THE OPPOSITE IMPRESSION WHENEVER I AM AT A PARTY AND I MENTION THAT I AM A PARTICLE PHYSICIST PEOPLE CAN'T STOP ASKING QUESTIONS

2 LABORATORY WORK SUCKS YOU OFTEN SIT IN A DARK ROOM WITHOUT SUNSHINE AND OFTEN WITH A LOT OF NOISY EQUIPMENT IT'S ALMOST NEVER A AS YOU DON'T INTERACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE BUT JUST YOUR LAB EQUIPMENT

AGAIN MY EXPERIENCE IS THE OPPOSITE EXPERIMENTS NOWADAYS ARE GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER AND REQUIRE A LOT OF INTERNATIONAL TEAM EFFORT ALTHOUGH OF COURSE YOU SOME TIMES HAVE TO SIT DOWN AND GET YOUR SHIT CALCULATION PROGRAMMING DONE MOST OF THE WORK CONSISTS OF TALKING WITH OTHER PEOPLE EVEN FOR THEORETICAL PHYSICISTS

SOCIAL INTERACTION OVERALL IS JUST VERY LOW PREPARING AN EXPERIMENT WRITING A REPORT STUDYING NEW PHENOMENA ANALYSING DATA CREATING A MODEL MOST OF THE TIME IT'S JUST YOU DOING YOUR OWN THING

SEE QUESTION ABOVE


ACCOMPLISHMENTS DON'T FEEL REWARDING AND AREN'T INTERESTING ON THEIR OWN AT THE END OF A WHOLE EXPERIMENT THE CONCLUSION COULD BE I CANNOT MEASURE THIS OR THAT PHENOMENA ACCURATE ENOUGH WITH THIS EQUIPMENT WELL AWESOME I GUESS YAY

YEAH THAT'S TRUE ONLY A VERY SMALL PORTION OF US WILL ACCOMPLISH WORK THAT WILL LEAD TO A NOBEL PRIZE HOWEVER BEING AT THE VERY FOREFRONT OF SCIENCE IS ALREADY COOL ENOUGH FOR ME AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THIS ALLOWS ME TO HAVE A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING IN OTHER PERHAPS COOLER RESULTS THAT POP UP IN MAGAZINES

UNINTERESTING PEOPLE TO STUDY WORK WITH MOST PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE VERY LITTLE HOBBIES STUDENT LIFE BESIDES PHYSICS PHYSICS ALSO SEEMS TO TAKE A HUGE CHUNK OF YOUR TIME MORE THAN OTHER STUDIES DO NOT TO MENTION IT'S A SAUSAGEFEST WITH IN MY YEAR OF THE PEOPLE BEING MALE

ALTHOUGH THEY DO EXIST THE PHYSICS NERD IN THE CLASSROOM USUALLY DOESN'T MAKE IT FAR IN RESEARCH THE REASON IS EXACTLY THAT MODERN RESEARCH NEEDS A LOT OF COMMUNICATION AND NOBODY IS SMART ENOUGH TO DO THE RESEARCH ON HIS OWN NOT EVEN THIS PHYSICS NERD WITHOUT HOBBIES IN YOUR CLASS ROOM YOU'LL HAVE A LOT LESS OF THESE GUYS IN RESEARCH ALTHOUGH IT STILL MIGHT BE A SAUSAGE FEST BUT YOU CAN HAVE AN INTERESTING JOB WHICH IS A SAUSAGE FEST AND YOU HAVE HOBBIES IN THE EVENING

STUDYING AND FINISHING ASSIGNMENTS IS OVERALL JUST A VERY FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE YOU OFTEN GET STUCK WITH NO IDEA WHAT TO DO TO GET TO THE SOLUTION YOU OFTEN DON'T UNDERSTAND SOMETHING AT ALL AND IF YOU'RE NOT CONSTANTLY CONCENTRATED YOU GET LOST AND BEHIND REALLY QUICKLY

HAHA THIS SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE MY RESEARCH IF YOU DON'T LIKE BEING CONFUSED IT IS PERHAPS BETTER TO QUIT PHYSICS NOW

PROFESSORS TEACHERS SEEM UNINTERESTED AND ARE REALLY BAD IN EXPLAINING STUFF I KEEP HEARING STUFF LIKE OH THAT'S TRIVIAL THAT'S TRIVIAL THAT'S TRIVIAL TRIVIAL TRIVIAL TRIVIAL I'LL SKIP THAT EVERYTHING IS TRIVIAL AND EASY TO THEM AND THEY DO NOT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S DEFINITELY NOT TO THEIR STUDENTS SERIOUSLY IT IS NOT UNCOMMON TO HAVE A 2 HOUR CLASS AND OF THE STUDENTS INCLUDING ME WALKING OUT OKE I HAD NO IDEA WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE LAST MINUTES GUESS I'LL HAVE TO STUDY IT ALL BY MYSELF AT HOME AND HOPE I UNDERSTAND LITERALLY EVERY DAMN TIME AND ASKING THE TEACHER TO EXPLAIN IT BETTER NEVER HELPS AS THEIR EXPLANATIONS ARE OFTEN JUST BAD THEY JUST MAKE YOU FEEL DUMB AND IT'S FRUSTRATING TO BE HONEST

I KINDA AGREE BUT I KIND OF NEED THOSE LECTURES TO FEEL MODEST AGAIN IN ANY CASE BAD TEACHERS EXIST PHYSICS IS HARD AND EVERYONE HAS TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING CERTAIN STUFF THE HARD PART IS NOT GETTING REMOTIVATED BY IT AND TO BE HARD AND PUSH THROUGH IT

AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU DON'T EVEN SEEM TO GET PAID THAT MUCH FOR GOING THROUGH ALL OF THIS AFTERALL THAT'S WHAT A JOB IS FOR AND MORE OFTEN THAN NOT EVEN IF YOU LOVE PHYSICS IF YOU ARE GOING TO DO IT HOURS A WEEK YOU WILL GET BORED OF IT AND YOU ARE GOING TO START HATING YOUR JOB SOME EXTRA MONEY TO HAVE A LESS STRESSFUL LIFE IS ALWAYS WELCOME THEN

I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT SWITCHING MY PHYSICS JOB THAT I LOVE FOR A JOB WITH MORE MAYBE I'LL DO IT AT SOME POINT LATER AND PREFERABLY BEFORE I'M SINCE ACADEMIA IS INDEED NOT A VERY SMART CHOICE BUT FOR NOW PHYSICS IS FUN AND THE JOB DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THE HOURS A WEEK WHICH WILL GET ME BORED LIKE YOU SAY

I THINK I WROTE ENOUGH ALREADY I DON'T EVEN CARE ABOUT MONEY THAT MUCH YET BY THE WAY SO DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S MY PRIMARY CONCERN IN THIS

IN GENERAL I THINK YOU HAVE A SLIGHTLY WRONG IMAGE OF HOW RESEARCH WORKS I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU DO SOME KIND OF INTERNSHIP TO SEE IF YOU LIKE IT
I HAVE PERSONALLY HAD GUYS AND GIRLS LIKE YOU AND SOME EVEN STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL TAG ALONG WITH ME FOR A DAY JUST TO SEE IF THEY LIKE RESEARCH AND THE WAY OF LIFE

FEEL FREE TO PM ME OP IF YOU HAVE SOME SPECIFIC QUESTION

I'M GOING TO BE HONEST I DIDN'T READ ALL YOUR CONCERNS BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS SCIENCE CAREERS ESPECIALLY PHYSICS REQUIRES A LOT OF SACRIFICE YOU WON'T MAKE MONEY YOU WON'T MAKE FRIENDS YOU WON'T MAKE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE BUT THOSE TIMES THAT YOU DO ARE THAT MUCH GREATER BECAUSE YOU DID IT WITH SOMETHING YOU LOVE BUT IF YOU DON'T LOVE IT THEN MAYBE IT'S NOT FOR YOU BUT DON'T CONFUSE FRUSTRATION WITH LACK OF AFFECTION
I'VE ALMOST FINISHED A PHD IN PHYSICS IT WAS THE GREATEST WASTE OF LIFETIME EVER

I NOW WORK IN QUANTITATIVE FINANCE PROGRAMMING SPECIALIZED HIGH PERFORMANCE BACK TESTING SOLUTIONS FOR DERIVATIVES WHICH I ORIGINALLY STARTED AS A HOBBY MY CURRENT EMPLOYER DIDN'T CARE ABOUT MY DEGREE AT ALL HE HIRED ME WHEN HE SAW THE RETURNS OF THE STRATEGIES I PROPOSED NOTHING OF THE PHYSICS PART IN PHYSICS EVER HELPED ME AT MY WORK I ONLY NEED SOME OF THE MATH I LEARNED IN THE FIRST TWO SEMESTERS LINEAR ALGEBRA ANALYSIS PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS STATISTICS

MY PROPOSAL LEAVE AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE DECENT MONEY THE IMPORTANCE OF MONEY WILL IMMEDIATELY OCCUR TO YOU AS SOON AS YOU DON'T HAVE ANY KEEP IN MIND THAT PHYSICS ON IT'S OWN WON'T MAKE YOU ANY MONEY YOU ALMOST ALWAYS WILL HAVE TO SWITCH TO SOME OTHER OCCUPATION FIELD SO WHY NOT DO IT RIGHT AWAY
JOIN US ASTROPHYSICISTS ASTRONOMERS WE ARE AT AVERAGE QUITE NICE PEOPLE AND EVERYBODY LOVES STUFF ABOUT STARS PLANETS THE COSMOS AND SUCH

MOST CONFERENCES ARE QUITE INTERESTING AND WE HAVE DRINKS TOGETHER AFTERWARDS
UNINTERESTING PEOPLE TO STUDY WORK WITH MOST PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE VERY LITTLE HOBBIES STUDENT LIFE BESIDES PHYSICS PHYSICS ALSO SEEMS TO TAKE A HUGE CHUNK OF YOUR TIME MORE THAN OTHER STUDIES DO NOT TO MENTION IT'S A SAUSAGE FEST WITH IN MY YEAR OF THE PEOPLE BEING MALE

REALLY I HAVE THE EXACT OPPOSITE OBSERVATION FOR PHYSICISTS ALMOST ALL PHYSICISTS I KNOW HAVE A SECONDARY OR TWO OR THREE OR MORE HOBBIES ONE OLD GUY WAS AN AVID SAILOR WHO WOULD SAIL IN THE SUMMERS I WAS WORRIED HE'D DIE EVERY SUMMER ANOTHER IS A IN A QUARTET MORE THAN A FEW CARTOONISTS AND SO ON WHILE THE ENGINEERING FRIENDS I HAVE ARE ALL ABOUT HOW HARD ENGINEERING WAS AND HOW HARD THEY PARTY WHEN THEY ARE NOT WORKING WHICH APPARENTLY MOSTLY MEANS LOUD AND TERRIBLE MUSIC WITH A LOT OF LIQUOR UNTIL THEY PASS OUT OR THROW UP

AND ABOUT THE RATIO IN MY UNDERGRAD IT WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY EVEN IF YOU COUNTED THE WHOLE DEPARTMENT BUT MORE LIKE WHEN YOU TAKE AWAY ASTRONOMY MAJORS IN GRAD SCHOOL YEAH THAT SEEMS ABOUT RIGHT IT'S NO ENGINEERING THOUGH THEY GET FEMALE PER MALES OR AT LEAST IT SEEMED THAT WAY TO MY FEMALE ENGINEERING FRIENDS

PEOPLE TELL ME IT GETS BETTER ONCE I DO MY MASTER'S MOST LIKELY PLASMA PHYSICS OR NUCLEAR FUSION ENGINEERING AND GET A COOL INTERNSHIP JOB

PLASMA PHYSICS IS THE BEST I DON'T THINK NUCLEAR FUSION ENGINEERING EXISTS THOUGH YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK INTO ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING OR MATERIALS SCIENCE IF YOU ARE THINKING OF AN ENGINEERING MASTERS OF USE TO NUCLEAR FUSION ENERGY RESEARCH THOUGH PLS HALP
I REALLY WANTED TO LIST ALL THE REASONS YOUR ATTITUDE IS SO TERRIBLE BUT I CAN'T HELP THINKING I HAD THE SAME THOUGHTS WHEN I WAS BEING ANNOYED THINGS DON'T SUIT YOU OR FALL INTO PLACE IS QUITE NORMAL BUT IT'S ALSO A REALLY SHITTY ATTITUDE YOU TALK ABOUT DEPRESSION WELL THAT'S A ROOT CAUSE OF IT RIGHT THERE

BEING MISERABLE WHEN YOU'RE IS HORRIBLE BUT IT'S VERY COMMON DON'T FOCUS ON THE NEGATIVE THOUGHTS YOU'RE HAVING AND JUST SIT BACK AND CONSIDER THE REALITY WHENEVER YOUR MOOD GOES THAT WAY DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT JUST DOING SAY MEDICINE OR BUSINESS REALLY WOULD MAKE YOU HAPPY IS THAT REALLY THE PROBLEM IF YOU COULD TALK ABOUT PHYSICS TO BE PEOPLE AT PARTIES WOULD EVERYTHING BE FINE

YOU SHOULD CONTINUE TO APPLY YOURSELF TO THE SUBJECT IF IT DOESN'T FIT IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S A DISASTER BE POSITIVE IF YOU DON'T LIKE PHYSICS YOU TRIED IT GET THE DEGREE AND LOOK FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT YOU CAN USE IT WITH THERE IS A SHIT LOAD MORE YOU CAN DO WITH A PHYSICS DEGREE THAN ANY OTHER SCIENCE DEGREE

IF YOU DON'T LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE SUBJECT THEN WHY ARE YOU LOOKING TO DO A MASTERS IF YOU HAVE TIME LOOK AT DIFFERENT MASTER OPTIONS FOR EXAMPLE IF WE'RE CUTTING TO THE CHASE MEDICAL PHYSICS HAS MORE WOMEN AND IS MORE APPLIED THAN LAB BASED RESEARCH

BTW NOT THAT YOU SHOULD BE BRINGING UP PHYSICS IN CONVERSATION BUT IF YOU CAN'T SOUND MORE INTERESTING TALKING ABOUT PHYSICS THAN A GEOLOGY OR BUSINESS STUDENT THEN YOU'RE AN IDIOT



I'M GOING THROUGH SOMETHING SIMILAR I TRANSFERRED SCHOOLS RECENTLY HOME UNIVERSITY WAS IN A PART OF THE COUNTY THAT WAS NOT PLAYING NICE WITH MY CHRONIC HEALTH ISSUES AND WENT FROM A SCHOOL WITH REALLY DEDICATED PROFS AND A SMALL DEPARTMENT TO A SCHOOL THAT ENDED UP HAVING PROFS WHO ARE TOO BUSY AND DON'T KNOW HOW TO TEACH WISH I'D KNOWN BEFORE I TRANSFERRED

I FEEL LONELY AND WORST OF ALL I FEEL STUPID FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS I WAS POSITIVE THAT I WOULD GO TO GRAD SCHOOL FOR PHYSICS WITH THE END GOAL OF GETTING A PH D IN PHYSICS EDUCATION STUDYING BOTH PHYSICS AND HOW BEST TO PRESENT IT TO STUDENTS THAT'S WHAT ALL MY RESEARCH IS IN THAT'S WHAT I'VE SPENT THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS DEDICATING MYSELF TO NOW I'M DRAGGING MYSELF TO CLASS AND FEELING LIKE THERE'S NO POINT IN TRYING

IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT IS POSSIBLY NOT SO GREAT FOR YOUR MENTAL HEALTH AND I DEFINITELY SYMPATHIZE WITH THAT PERSONALLY I KNOW THAT I AM CLINICALLY DEPRESSED AT THE MOMENT IT DEFINITELY DOESN'T HELP WHEN TRYING TO MAKE LIFE DECISIONS

THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT YOU CAN DO QUITE A BIT WITH AN UNDERGRAD DEGREE IN PHYSICS A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T EVEN GET HIRED TO WORK SPECIFICALLY IN A PHYSICS FIELD THE WAY ONE OF MY FAVORITE PROFS PUT IT IS THAT YOU BASICALLY HAVE A DEGREE IN AND MANY EMPLOYERS LOVE THAT YOU CAN ALSO GO TO GRAD SCHOOL FOR PLENTY OF OTHER THINGS PERSONALLY MY OWN DEPRESSION AND SUBSEQUENT APATHY REGARDING PHYSICS MEANS THAT PHYSICS GRAD SCHOOL IS OUT OF THE QUESTION I WANT TO PURSUE PHYSICS ON THE SIDE AS A HOBBY THAT I CAN LEARN ABOUT AND LOVE IN MY FREE TIME I'LL BE GOING TO GRAD SCHOOL FOR GEOSCIENCE INSTEAD

SO ULTIMATELY NO IT WASN'T A BAD DECISION IMHO YOU CAN DO A LOT OF THINGS WITH THAT DEGREE AND YOU CAN EVEN STILL GO TO GRAD SCHOOL FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT I HOPE SOME OF THIS IS HELPFUL

EDIT I MADE AN INCORRECT ASSUMPTION THAT YOU WERE IN THE AMERICAS MY APOLOGIES IS IT POSSIBLE TO GO TO GRAD SCHOOL FOR SOMETHING RELATED BUT NOT SPECIFICALLY PHYSICS FOR EXAMPLE I CHOSE GEOSCIENCE BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A HOBBY OF MINE AND I HAVE ALL THE REQUIREMENTS MATH AND SCIENCE BACKGROUND IS ALL THEY REQUIRE HERE

EDIT 2 LOOKING BACK ON YOUR POST IT ISN'T CLEAR IF YOU'VE DONE ANY LAB WORK OUTSIDE OF CLASSES CLASS LAB WORK AT LEAST IN MY OWN EXPERIENCE IS OFTEN TEDIOUS AND PLAGUED WITH BROKEN EQUIPMENT IT ISN'T AT ALL LIKE WORKING IN A LAB DOING NEW EXPERIMENTS WITH A GROUP IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO WORK WITH A PROFESSOR AT YOUR UNIVERSITY YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY GIVE IT A TRY I WENT OUT OF MY WAY TO BEFRIEND A NEW PROFESSOR WHO IS NOW MY RESEARCH ADVISOR AND CONNECTION TO MOST OF THE OTHER PEOPLE I KNOW IN THE DEPARTMENT KNOWING PEOPLE AND BUILDING CONNECTIONS IS VERY REWARDING AS WELL
I SUFFERED FROM MINOR DEPRESSION AT THE START OF MY JUNIOR YEAR AND AFTER I FINISHED MY BACHELORS THE MOST I CAN SAY IS YES A LOT OF PEOPLE IN TECH ARE KIND OF LAME FIND THE ONES THAT AREN'T AND FUCKING STICK TO THEM IT IS AMAZING HOW MUCH DOING WORK WITH EVEN ANOTHER PERSON IN THE ROOM IMPROVES IT TREMENDOUSLY AND WORKING WITH A STUDY GROUP MAKES WORK AT LEAST TWICE AS ENJOYABLE AND EASIER WHEN YOUR MIND GETS ALL TIED UP IN KNOTS IN MY EXPERIENCE ALL IT TAKES TO GET OUT IS JUST TALKING ABOUT YOUR PROBLEM WITH ANOTHER PERSON ONCE YOU LEARN HOW TO DO IT THE KNOTS JUST SLIP AWAY AND PLUS THE PROMISE THAT YOU'LL ALL BE UP FOR A DRINK AFTER A PARTICULARLY TOUGH SET CAN GET YOU THROUGH JUST ABOUT ANYTHING

AS FOR THE CAREER STUFF I HAVE MORE LIMITED EXPERIENCE BUT ONCE YOU START GETTING INTERNSHIPS AND SEEING STUFF FROM THE OTHER SIDE THINGS IMPROVE TREMENDOUSLY YOU MIGHT NOT NOTICE IT NOW BUT EVERYONE AROUND YOU IS SUBCONSCIOUSLY TREATING YOU AS IF YOU'RE HEADED FOR ACADEMIA SUDDENLY YOU'RE OUT OF THAT DARK DARK WORLD AND CAN SEE A LIGHT THAT THEY CAN'T SORRY TO ANY ACADEMICS HERE PEOPLE AT WORK ARE THE ONES WHO DIDN'T CHOOSE ACADEMIA SO IN MY EXPERIENCE THEY'RE MORE INTERESTING NOT A LOT OF WOMEN TO BE SURE BUT I'D SAY YOU SHOULDN'T BE LOOKING FOR LOVE AT YOUR WORKPLACE ANYWAYS AND AGAIN IF YOU FIND A GOOD TEAM TO WORK WITH IT'S A WHOLE OTHER WORLD TIME FLIES BY TECH ISN'T NICE BECAUSE THE PAYS EXCEPTIONAL IT'S GREAT BECAUSE THE PAY IS REALLY GOOD FOR AN ENJOYABLE LOW STRESS JOB WITH MINIMAL PREREQUISITES

SO I GUESS I GOT AWAY FROM MY POINT BUT IT'S THAT A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT YOU'RE IN A BAD ATMOSPHERE BUT THAT ATMOSPHERE ISN'T NEARLY AS PERVASIVE AS YOU PERCEIVE IT TO BE IN MY EXPERIENCE
UNINTERESTING PEOPLE TO STUDY WORK WITH MOST PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE VERY LITTLE HOBBIES STUDENT LIFE BESIDES PHYSICS PHYSICS ALSO SEEMS TO TAKE A HUGE CHUNK OF YOUR TIME MORE THAN OTHER STUDIES DO NOT TO MENTION IT'S A SAUSAGEFEST WITH IN MY YEAR OF THE PEOPLE BEING MALE

THIS IS BECAUSE PHYSICS IS OFTEN TIMES SUCH A HUGELY FASCINATING SUBJECT TO ITS FOLLOWERS STUDIERS THAT IT IS ENTIRELY FULFILLING OUTSIDERS CALL IT AN IMBALANCE LIFE BUT PEOPLE THAT LIVE IT DO NOT ALWAYS AGREE

PHYSICS IS BASICALLY A PASSION AN OBSESSION FOR THOSE WHO ARE TRULY GOOD AT IT THE SAME IS TRUE OF MATHEMATICS I BELIEVE THOSE TWO SUBJECTS HAVE THIS EFFECT MORE THAN ANY OTHERS

IF YOU'RE YOUNG YOU MAY STILL DEVELOP THIS IF YOU AREN'T MAYBE YOU'RE IN THE WRONG FIELD

IT BEING A SAUSAGE FEST TELLS ME YOU ARE NO OLDER THAN YEARS OLD SO YOU REALLY NEED TO DO SOME THINKING ABOUT YOUR LIFE BEFORE YOU WRITE OFF A CAREER FIELD BECAUSE YOUR AREN'T HOT BELIEVE ME AT I'M SURE I HAD SOME OF THOSE FEELINGS TOO YOU JUST NEED TO BE MORE MATURE ABOUT THIS
DO A POSTGRADUATE IN SOMETHING FINANCIAL MAYBE
HONESTLY IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU AREN'T THAT INTERESTED IN IT YOU COULD ALWAYS SWITCH TO MATH AND BECOME A HEDGE FUND QUANT
I'M CURRENTLY A STUDENT IN A MASTER DEGREE IN NUCLEAR PHYSICS I'VE FELT THE SAME AFTER MY 3RD YEAR I'VE HESITATE A LOT BUT AFTER TRYING THE MASTER DEGREE IN PHYSICS EDUCATION TO BECOME AN HIGHSCHOOL TEACHER I CAME BACK BECAUSE I WAS PASSIONATE AND I DON'T REGRET IT AT ALL IF YOU ARE IN 3RD YEAR MAYBE YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH EXPERIENCE IN LAB RESEARCH EVEN IF IT CAN BE VERY FRUSTRATING IT'S ALSO VERY INTERESTING AND VERY REWARDING TO SEE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WORKS BUT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR RECOGNITION FROM OTHER PEOPLE OR MONEY OR CELEBRITY IT IS NOT FOR YOU
I CAN RECOGNIZE MYSELF IN A LOT OF YOUR THOUGHTS AT THE END OF MY BACHELOR IN PHYSICS I WAS OVERWORKED AND IT MADE ME DOUBT IF I WAS DOING THE BEST THING FOR ME AFTER A BREAK AND TIME TO THINK I REDISCOVERED WHY I LIKE PHYSICS AND WHY I WANT TO DO IT A BREAK COULD HELP YOU TOO EVEN IF YOU DECIDE TO LEAVE PHYSICS

HAVE YOU LOOKED INTO ONE YEAR MASTER'S PROGRAMS IF YOU STILL WANT TO DO SOMETHING RELATED TO SCIENCE BUT WITH MORE SOCIAL INTERACTION PROGRAMS LIKE SCIENCE AND BUSINESS SCIENCE AND EDUCATION OR SCIENCE AND COMMUNICATION MIGHT SUIT YOU A LOT OF JOBS THAT PHYSICS MAJORS GET INTO LIKE CONSULTANCY IT OR PROJECT MANAGEMENT ARE STILL OPTIONS WITH A MASTER'S IN SUCH AN AREA I HAVE SEEN CLASSMATES TAKE THESE PATHS IN THE NETHERLANDS IT'S TRUE THAT IT'S RARE FOR STUDENTS TO GET A JOB DIRECTLY AFTER THEIR BACHELOR'S HERE

GOOD LUCK
I DID A PHYSICS DEGREE BECAUSE I FOUND THE SUBJECT INTERESTING I NEVER HAD ANY PLANS TO WORK IN THE FIELD AFTERWARDS THE GOOD THING WITH PHYSICS IS THAT THE PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS YOU LEARN ARE TRANSFERABLE TO A LOT OF JOBS I NOW WORK AS A SOFTWARE ENGINEER MYSELF
I DON'T KNOW HOE OTHER BUSINESSES HANDLE HIRING BUT WE TREAT A BS IN PHYSICS THE SAME AS A BS IN ENGINEERING THERE ARE LOTS OF ENTRY LEVEL OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG ENGINEERS SOME OF THE ENGINEERING JOBS ARE A DULL PAPERWORK GRIND BUT SOME PEOPLE WANT THAT DEVELOPMENT ENGINEERING IS VERY INTERESTING IT IS NOT PURE SCIENCE TRUE BUT YOU MIGHT FIND THAT FIGURING OUT HOW TO DO SOMETHING IS JUST AS REWARDING AS MAKING SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES
I'M IN THE SAME BOAT AS YOU AT THE MOMENT A I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF MY SECOND TERM AND WORKING ON MY TEACHER'S LASER SPECTROSCOPY LABORATORY THIS HAS BEEN GIVING ME A LOT OF UNDERSTANDING ON WHAT I MIGHT WORK LATER ON

SADLY I DON'T THINK I WILL LIKE IT I'VE ALWAYS ENJOYED PHYSICS AND MATHS AND I'M ALSO ENJOYING ALL MY SUBJECTS BUT THE CAREER PATH DOESN'T SEEM INTEREST ME I'VE BEEN CONTEMPLATING A CHANGE IN COURSE TO MECHANICAL ENGINEERING BECAUSE FROM THE TALKS THAT I HAD WITH MY TEACHERS IT APPEARS BE THE MAJOR THAT BEST SUITS MY INTERESTS BUT I HAVE ROUGHLY YEAR TO DECIDE BECAUSE OF THE LAB WORK HOPEFULLY YOU WILL CHOOSE WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU AND THINGS WILL WORK OUT FINE
HEY OP I JUST GOT MY BACHELORS IN PHYSICS AND MATH IN MAY AND I WAS IN A SIMILAR BOAT WITH YOU TOWARDS THE END OF MY UNDERGRAD STUDIES

I HAD ALWAYS PLANNED ON DOING THE PH D TRACK BUT HAD DECIDED BEFORE MY LAST SEMESTER THAT GOING TO GRAD SCHOOL WASN'T SOMETHING I WANTED TO DO CERTAINLY NOT NOW AND PROBABLY NOT EVER

BUT THEN THE NIGHT BEFORE MY LAST FINAL EXAM ELECTRODYNAMICS CAME AROUND AND I POPPED SOME ADDERALL AND STAYED UP ALL NIGHT STUDYING I HADN'T PAYED ATTENTION IN THE CLASS ALL SEMESTER AND BASICALLY HAD TO TEACH IT ALL TO MYSELF THAT NIGHT AROUND AM WITH THE ABILITY TO FOCUS WELL ON THE WORK I HAD THIS HUGE EPIPHANY THAT I WAS REALLY ENJOYING SOLVING PRACTICE PROBLEMS AND UNDERSTANDING THEM AFTER AT LEAST 2 OR SEMESTERS OF FEELING VERY BURNT OUT I STARTED TO FEEL VERY SAD THAT I WOULDN'T BE SITTING IN CLASS AND LEARNING AND ACCOMPLISHING THESE THINGS ANY MORE AT THAT MOMENT I DECIDED I WANTED TO PURSUE PHYSICS FURTHER

BUT I'M NOT DOING IT RIGHT NOW I'M TAKING AT LEAST A YEAR OFF TO GO TEACH ENGLISH IN ASIA AND THEN PLANNING ON COMING BACK TO DO GRAD SCHOOL

MAYBE YOUR JADEDNESS IS MORE INTENSE THAN MINE WAS BUT PERHAPS TAKE SOME TIME TO REALLY THINK ABOUT WHY YOU DID PHYSICS IN THE FIRST PLACE MAYBE SOME OF THAT PASSION IS STILL THERE MAYBE TAKE SOME TIME OFF AND SEE WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO DO BUT I'D DEFINITELY SAY DON'T GO TO GRAD SCHOOL IF YOU AREN'T SURE YOU WANT TO AND IT ISN'T A BIG DEAL IF YOU DON'T
OF THE TIME CAN BE REMEDIED BY DOING THE READING BEFORE CLASSICAL
I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN BUT I TRULY HOPE YOU DO NOT BELIEVE THAT YOUR TIME HAS BEEN WASTED HAVING GRADUATED WITH A BS IN PHYSICS I CAN ATTEST TO A LOT OF THE CONCERNS DISPLEASURES YOU HAVE HAD PERSONALLY I WASN'T SURE PURSUING GRADUATE STUDY IN PHYSICS WAS RIGHT FOR ME AFTERWARDS MY CONCERN WAS THAT SO MUCH TIME AND EFFORT IN PHYSICS ARE DEDICATED SIMPLY TO VERIFYING EXISTING MODELS TO JUSTIFY THE USE OF VARIOUS MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORKS WHEREAS I SOUGHT TO APPLY A LOT OF THE FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE GLEANED FROM PHYSICS STUDY MORE TO THE CREATING OF DELIVERABLES I WENT INTO NUCLEAR ENGINEERING PHD STUDY AND THE COMBINATION OF PHYSICS AND ENGINEERING APPROACHES TO MY RESEARCH SEEMS TO BE APPRECIATED

THE FACT THAT CANNOT BE UNDERSTATED ENOUGH IS THAT THE SKILLS YOU'VE UNDOUBTEDLY ACQUIRED DURING YOU BS ARE UNIVERSALLY APPLICABLE THE WORK ETHIC TAKEN FROM HOURS SPENT APPROACHING THE SAME SIMPLE PROBLEM DIFFERENT WAYS THE HUMILITY REQUIRED WHEN YOU REALIZE OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD AROUND US IS OFTEN BASED ON MODELS THAT CONSISTENTLY REQUIRE UPDATING AND THE CREATIVITY NEEDED WHEN YOUR STUDY IS BASED SO HEAVILY IN ABSTRACTION

DESPITE COMPANIES AND PLACES OF WORK STATING THAT THEY MAY MORE OFTEN BE LOOKING FOR PEOPLE WITH PIECES OF PAPER THAT DON'T SAY PHYSICS ON THEM MANY DON'T REALIZE THE SKILLET THAT A BS IN PHYSICS COMES WITH IT MAY BE HARD TO FORGE A PATH OUTSIDE OF THE USUAL GRIND FROM BS RIGHT TO GRAD SCHOOL BUT DON'T REGRET YOUR CHOICE BECAUSE I AM CERTAIN THAT YOUR DEGREE HAS AT THE BARE MINIMUM INSTILLED IN YOU A PHENOMENAL FRAMEWORK FOR BEING A LIFELONG LEARNER IN ANY FIELD OR ANY CAREER PATH
IT'S SO FUNNY BECAUSE IF YOU LIST THOSE SAME THINGS BUT WITH A POSITIVE TONE INSTEAD OF NEGATIVE IT'S EXACTLY WHY I DO PHYSICS

EXCEPT MAYBE THE 1ST ONE I HATE TALKING ABOUT WORK IT MAKES OTHER PEOPLE FEEL DUMB AND MAKES THEM THINK I'M SMARTER THAN I AM
HEY MAN I DID A B SOUTH IN PHYSICS THEN SWITCHED TO MECHANICAL ENGINEERING FOR GRAD SCHOOL

ALL OF THE THINGS YOU SAID I FELT THOSE AT SOME POINT EXCEPT FOR

WHAT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THAT STUDYING PHYSICS CHANGES THE WAY YOUR BRAIN FUNCTIONS IT CREATES A SPECIFIC KIND OF MIND WHICH STUDYING OTHER SUBJECTS DOES NOT IF YOU DON'T LIKE LACWORK STAY OUT OF GRADSCHOOL THE SOCIAL ASPECT ONLY GETS WORSE THE EQUIPMENT GETS LOUDER AND THE ROOMS GET LESS SUNNY HAHA

BUT CHEER UP YOU CAN GET A JOB DOING ANYTHING YOU'RE GOOD AT AND STUDYING PHYSICS MAKES YOU GOOD AT A LOT OF THINGS MOST SMART PEOPLE I KNOW EAST G MY WIFE BEST FRIENDS DID NOT STUDY SCIENCE IN COLLEGE I WAS AN OUTLIER LIKE YOU ALMOST EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM PEOPLE HAVE EXPRESSED TO ME SOME KIND OF REGRET FOR NOT PURSUING COMPUTER SCIENCE CHEMISTRY ETC THE VALUE OF A EDUCATION IS SOMETHING THAT APPRECIATES OVER TIME LOTS OF OTHER DEGREE PROGRAMS BUSINESS ADMIN INTERNATIONAL STUDIES ENGLISH ETC LEAVE BRIGHT GRADUATES WITH DOUBTS TOO


EVERYBODY LIKES A PHYSICS MAJOR WITH ENTHUSIASM JUST FAKE IT TIL YOU MAKE IT BRO
YOU GET TO TELL FOLKS SILLY TALES ABOUT THE NAMES OF THE DERIVATIVES OF MOTION VELOCITY ACCELERATION JERK ETC
IF YOU WHERE INITIALLY ATTRACTED TO PHYSICS BECAUSE OF SCIENCE FICTION LEVEL PHYSICS OR THE EXCITEMENT OF NEW DISCOVERY AS I WAS I RECOMMEND YOU EITHER LOOK INTO CHEMISTRY OR ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY FOR ONE IS A SCIENCE WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE EFFECTS IN A MACROSCOPIC SCALE AS APPOSED TO PHYSICS WHERE YOU ARE MOSTLY LIMITED TO A COMPUTER SPITTING OUT NUMBERS THAT DON'T MAKE SENSE UNTIL YOU ANALYZE THEM FOR MONTHS ENGINEERING MY CURRENT MAJOR IS MORE LIKE APPLIED PHYSICS YOU TAKE THE KNOWLEDGE OBTAINED THROUGH PHYSICS AND DISCOVER WAYS TO IMPLEMENT IT IN NEW TECHNOLOGY IT IS HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IS FINDING OUT WHAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO SO CONGRATULATIONS YOU'RE ALREADY HALFWAY THERE GOOD LUCK AND DON'T BE AFRAID TO EXPLORE A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS
I HAD REGRETS HALF WAY THROUGH JUNIOR YEAR I ENDED UP GOING INTO CS WITH A PHYSICS DEGREE
AS SOMEONE EMPATHETIC TO SOME OF THE THINGS YOU MENTION I THINK IT COULD HELP TO TAKE SOME TIME TO REMEMBER WHY YOU DECIDED TO EMBARK ON THIS JOURNEY IN THE FIRST PLACE

I THINK IF YOU'RE REASON WAS THAT YOU'LL HAVE A BUNCH OF FRIENDS AND A GREAT TIME SOCIALLY THEN YOUR DISAPPOINTMENT IS JUSTIFIED

IF YOUR INTEREST WAS INSTEAD SIMPLY SCIENCE NAMELY PHYSICS THEN IT MIGHT BE GOOD TO REMIND YOURSELF OF THAT ITS ABOUT PHYSICS ITS NOT ABOUT UNIVERSITY UNIVERSITY DEGREES ARE JUST A SEMI CONVENIENT AND FORMALLY NECESSARY WAY TO GO ABOUT LEANING PHYSICS


DO YOU PERHAPS STUDY AT TU E IF SO I CAN TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU ON SOME POINTS ESPECIALLY AND NEXT TO THAT AT THE END OF MY FIRST YEAR BSC NOW IN MY THIRD I REALIZED THAT THIS WASN'T THE THING I WANTED TO DO AFTER ALL LUCKILY I COULD CHANGE MY ELECTIVES DRASTICALLY IN ORDER TO PREPARE FOR A MASTER'S IN A DIFFERENT FIELD OF STUDY INSTEAD OF STARTING A NEW BSC AGAIN IF YOU STUDY AT TU E FROM MY EXPERIENCE THE AMOUNT AND VARIETY OF ELECTIVES IS VERY BIG SO MAYBE YOU CAN TRY SOME
HONESTLY IT SOUNDS LIKE THE PROBLEM IS YOUR UNIVERSITY NOT PHYSICS IN GENERAL MY EXPERIENCE STUDYING PHYSICS IS ALMOST COMPLETELY OPPOSITE TO YOURS
CONTEXT I'M AUSTRALIAN AND I'VE HEARD THE CULTURE IN UNIVERSITIES HERE IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LAID BACK AND CASUAL AND THUS SOCIAL I DON'T KNOW ANYONE IN MY UNIVERSITY THAT CALLS ANYONE BY DR NAME OR PROF NAME EVERYONE IS ON A FIRST NAME BASIS SO TAKE MY PERSPECTIVE WITH THAT IN MIND MY SOLE POINT IS THAT THIS ISN'T A PROBLEM WITH PHYSICS ITSELF IT'S ONE PARTICULAR SUBSET OF PHYSICS CULTURE SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD


DEPENDS WHO YOU HANG OUT WITH I GUESS

2 YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO LAB WORK BUT EVEN MOST LAB WORK IS VERY TEAM BASED MOST OF MY PHYSICS WORK IS COLLABORATION WITH OTHER PEOPLE

AGAIN THIS CLASHES WITH MY EXPERIENCE BUT MAYBE IT'S JUST THE PARTICULAR FIELD EXPERIMENTS YOU WERE DOING I'M ALWAYS BOUNCING IDEAS OFF MY COWORKERS AND SOCIALIZING WITH THEM WHILE WORKING

TYPICALLY YOU WOULD BE WORKING ON A PROJECT THAT YOU CAN BE PRETTY CONFIDENT IS GOING TO WORK IT'S ALL ABOUT STANDING ON THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS RIGHT SO USUALLY YOU'RE USING ESTABLISHED METHODS WITH ESTABLISHED EQUIPMENT TO DO SOME TINY THING THAT ISN'T ESTABLISHED YET THE FACT THAT THE EQUIPMENT AND METHODS ARE ESTABLISHED USUALLY MEANS YOUR PROJECT HAS A HIGH CHANCE OF SUCCESS IF YOU'RE CONSTANTLY INVOLVED WITH PROJECTS THAT HAVE NO POSITIVE RESULTS THEN WHOEVER IS CALLING THE SHOTS ON WHAT THE PROJECTS SHOULD BE REALLY NEEDS TO UP THEIR GAME

IF YOU'RE IN UNDERGRAD OR DOING SOME OTHER MINOR PROJECT THEN THAT MAY JUST BE THE WAY THE COOKIE CRUMBLES FOR THAT PROJECT

AGAIN REALLY JUST DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU END UP AND WHO YOU END UP SOCIALIZING WITH MY OFFICE SPACE IS FEMALE THEY ALL ARE SUPER INTERESTING PEOPLE WITH GREAT HOBBIES AND DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON STUFF MY HOBBIES ARE GAMING WRITING ART PHILOSOPHY POLITICS LEARNING JAPANESE SCIENTIFIC VISUAL DESIGN MAYBE ALL THESE THINGS COUNT AS BORING TO YOU BUT I'M PROBABLY THE LEAST INTERESTING OF MY COHORT

THIS IS ENTIRELY AN ISSUE OF HOW YOU GET TAUGHT AND HOW YOU LEARN BOTH OF THESE THINGS CAN BE IMPROVED BUT IT'S NOT THE FAULT OF PHYSICS

YOUR PROFESSORS JUST SOUND LIKE THEY'RE NOT VERY GOOD AT THE TEACHING NURTURING SIDE OF THINGS THIS SEEMS TO BE A COMMON POINT IN MOST OF YOUR COMPLAINTS IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT THE PLACE AND PEOPLE YOU FIND YOURSELF WITH ARE PUTTING A DOWNER ON YOUR PHYSICS LIFE THIS IS NOT THE FAULT OF PHYSICS

IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN MONEY IT IS TRUE THAT LIVING THE LIFE OF A PHYSICIST WILL NOT MAKE YOU MUCH MONEY YOU SHOULD BE A PHYSICIST BECAUSE YOU LOVE PHYSICS THAT BEING SAID HAVING A DEGREE IN PHYSICS IS GREAT FOR APPLYING TO ECONOMIC ACCOUNTING ORIENTED JOBS WHICH WILL GET YOU A LOT OF MONEY LOTS OF PHYSICISTS GO INTO HIGH FREQUENCY TRADING AND MAKE TOO MUCH MONEY TO KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH


HAVING FINISHED READING AND RESPONDING TO YOUR WHOLE POST I SEE THAT YOU'RE IN UNDERGRAD LEARNING PHYSICS IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TO DOING PHYSICS BUT IF YOU'RE FEELING DOWN AND OUT BY UNDERGRAD THEN I CAN'T REALLY RECOMMEND PHYSICS TO YOU THAT BEING SAID IT MIGHT JUST BE BECAUSE YOUR LEARNING ENVIRONMENT IS HORRID ALL I CAN SAY IS IF YOU DO DECIDE TO GO INTO THEN YOU SHOULD MAKE SURE YOU GO SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU LIKE THE PEOPLE AND PROFESSORS
NOBODY EVER UNDERSTANDS OR IS INTERESTED IN WHAT I AM SAYING IF I BRING UP PHYSICS IN CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHERS

AS A PHD STUDENT WHO LOVES DOING OUTREACH EVENTS TO THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE SUBJECT ITS DIFFICULT TO GET PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT PHYSICS MANY PEOPLE STRUGGLE AT SCHOOL DOING IT AND DON'T SEE IT AS SOMETHING FUN AND COOL THE TRICK IS TO FIND SOMETHING THAT'S AMAZING AND FIND A NEAT WAY OF EXPLAINING IT OR BRINGING UP A TOPIC ABOUT SOMETHING THATS HAPPENED RECENTLY IN THE NEWS

YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER THAT PEOPLE MIGHT NOT HAVE A BACKGROUND OR KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT IMAGINE TRYING TO TALK TO SOMEONE ABOUT FOOTBALL THAT KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT IT JUST MORE PEOPLE KNOW FOOTBALL THAN THEY DO PHYSICS

2 LABORATORY WORK SUCKS YOU OFTEN SIT IN A DARK ROOM WITHOUT SUNSHINE AND OFTEN WITH A LOT OF NOISY EQUIPMENT

WHILE THIS IS CERTAINLY TRUE IN SOME RESEARCH FIELDS IT'S SOMETIMES NOT A BAD THING JUST MAKE SURE THAT IF FOR INSTANCE PEOPLE ARE HAVING COFFEE OR GOING TO LUNCH YOU TRY AND JOIN THEM THE LONG STRETCHES IN THE LAB WHERE YOU'RE JUST WITH THE EQUIPMENT MAKING STUFF WORK CAN BE QUITE THERAPEUTIC

SOCIAL INTERACTION OVERALL IS JUST VERY LOW

NOT SOMETHING I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED IN GRAD SCHOOL QUITE THE OPPOSITE ACTUALLY COMPARED TO UNDERGRAD

ACCOMPLISHMENTS DON'T FEEL REWARDING AND AREN'T INTERESTING ON THEIR OWN

THIS IS JUST A MATTER OF PERSPECTIVE FOR INSTANCE I CAN'T MEASURE HIGH FREQUENCY MOTION WITH THE THING I'M WORKING ON BECAUSE A FAN IS RATTLING A TONNE OPTICAL BENCH AND CAUSING A LASER BEAM TO MOVE ABOUT BY HUNDREDTHS OF A NANOMETER THAT GENUINELY IS AMAZING

UNINTERESTING PEOPLE TO STUDY WORK WITH MOST PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE VERY LITTLE HOBBIES STUDENT LIFE BESIDES PHYSICS

AGAIN NOT SOMETHING I'VE EVER FOUND IN GRAD SCHOOL TALK TO PEOPLE THEY'RE MORE INTERESTING THAN YOU FIRST THINK

STUDYING AND FINISHING ASSIGNMENTS IS OVERALL JUST A VERY FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE YOU OFTEN GET STUCK WITH NO IDEA WHAT TO DO TO GET TO THE SOLUTION

THIS IS WHAT RESEARCH IS ABOUT YOUR DOING IT BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE HAS DONE IT BEFORE YOU GET AROUND THIS BY TRYING DIFFERENT STUFF AND WRITING IT DOWN TO RULE OUT FACTORS WRITING UP IS ANNOYING BUT AT LEAST YOU GET A PAPER OR TWO OUT OF THE WHOLE THING

PROFESSORS TEACHERS SEEM UNINTERESTED AND ARE REALLY BAD IN EXPLAINING STUFF I KEEP HEARING STUFF LIKE OH THAT'S TRIVIAL THAT'S TRIVIAL THAT'S TRIVIAL TRIVIAL TRIVIAL TRIVIAL I'LL SKIP THAT

GO TO THEM AND EXPLAIN THAT ITS NOT TRIVIAL TO YOU I'VE HAD LECTURERS THAT SAY ITS TRIVIAL FIND SOMEONE ELSE WHO WILL KNOW YOU'LL FIND THAT YOU'LL NEVER UTTER THE WORDS IT'S TRIVIAL OR IT'S EASY TO ANYONE

AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU DON'T EVEN SEEM TO GET PAID THAT MUCH FOR GOING THROUGH ALL OF THIS AFTERALL THAT'S WHAT A JOB IS FOR

IF YOU'RE DOING GRAD SCHOOL RESEARCH IN AN INSTITUTION FOR THE MONEY YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG IDEA YOU DO IT BECAUSE YOU FIND IT FUN TO EXPLORE MORE ABOUT THE WORLD IN A WAY THAT NO ONE ELSE HAS DONE BEFORE

WITH DEPRESSION PEOPLE GET IT I HAD DEPRESSION DOING MY MASTERS PROJECT IT WASN'T A FUN TIME BUT IT WILL GET BETTER NO MATTER HOW BLEAK IT SOUNDS NOW EITHER ON YOUR OWN OR GETTING HELP HELP YOU'RE CERTAINLY NOT ALONE IN GETTING DEPRESSED HAVING IMPOSTER SYNDROME AT ALL BY DOING A DEGREE ESPECIALLY IN A DEGREE LIKE PHYSICS YOUR DOING SOMETHING FEW PEOPLE DO SEE POINT CERTAINLY DON'T TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM WHAT YOUR DOING OR THINK THAT THE WHOLE THING SHOULD BE TRIVIAL ITS NOT


I THINK IT JUST DEPENDS ON YOUR PERSONALITY TYPE MOST OF THE THINGS YOU LIST I LOVE AND HAVE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES WITH THINK OF WHAT MADE YOU FIRST LOVE PHYSICS AND SCIENCE AND TRY TO IMAGINE WHY YOU STARTED YOUR BS IN PHYSICS
MAYBE YOU CAN TRANSITION INTO A DATA SCIENCE CAREER
I JUST GRADUATED IN MAY WITH MY BACHELORS IN PHYSICS AND WHILE I AGREE WITH MUCH OF WHAT YOU SAID I ALSO AGREE WITH OTHER PEOPLE WHO'VE COMMENTED IN THAT IT SEEMS LIKE A BIT OF AN ATTITUDE PROBLEM

I AM LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE SPENT ENOUGH TIME ON AN ASTRONOMY RESEARCH PROJECT THAT FORCED ME TO BECOME GOOD AT ARTICULATING PHYSICS TO THIS ALSO STEMS FROM THE FACT THAT I TRULY FIND PHYSICS AND AS U SAID METAPHYSICS ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING

ALL THINGS CONSIDERED I AM MORE ON THE INTROVERTED SIDE OF THE SPECTRUM PRETTY AVERAGE FOR A PHYSICIST SO I FEEL YOUR PAIN ON THE SOCIAL SIDE I STRUGGLED WITH DEPRESSION THROUGH ALL YEARS OF MY UNDERGRAD US BUT FINDING A GOOD FRIEND GROUP OF VARYING DISCIPLINES REALLY OPENED MY MIND AND HELPED ME COPE WITH LIFE AND THE INTENSE DIFFICULTY OF STUDYING PHYSICS DON'T LET THE CYNICISM CONSUME YOU THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO REALLY DO CARE ABOUT PHYSICS MANY OF THEM WHO DON'T STUDY ANY OF IT I AM LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE FRIENDS WHO LOVE METAPHYSICS AND PHYSICS ALMOST AS MUCH AS I DO AND THEY LOVE TO HEAR ABOUT PHYSICAL CONCEPTS APPLIED TO THEIR EVERYDAY LIVES IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE ALL THAT I'VE STUDIED IS SO WORTH IT

CHIN UP PAL HAVING THE PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS LIKE MANY OF US DO REALLY DOES OPEN DOORS TO SOME COMPLETELY UNRELATED FIELDS TEST THE WATERS FIND YOUR PASSIONS AND PURSUE THEM THAT DEGREE PUTS YOU METERS AHEAD OF OTHER

ALSO WOULD NOT SUGGEST GRAD SCHOOL YET IF THIS IS YOUR CURRENT DEMEANOR ABOUT PHYSICS
I PERSONALLY HAVEN'T HAD MANY OF THE SAME EXPERIENCES WHILE STUDYING PHYSICS BUT I CAN TRY TO OFFER SOME ADVICE ANYWAY

IF YOU ARE NO LONGER ENJOYING YOUR PHYSICS STUDIES YOU MOST LIKELY DON'T WANT TO MAKE A CAREER OUT OF IT YOU PROBABLY DON'T EVEN WANT TO GO TO GRADUATE SCHOOL IN IT EVEN IF THAT IS THE NORM IN YOUR COUNTRY IT'S OKAY TO LEAVE THE FIELD YOU MIGHT CONSIDER SEVERAL OPTIONS SUCH AS GOING DIRECTLY INTO INDUSTRY OR PURSUING A MASTER'S DEGREE IN A RELATED FIELD SUCH AS ENGINEERING DATA SCIENCE FINANCE OR COMPUTER SCIENCE PHYSICISTS ARE OFTEN ABLE TO TRANSITION INTO THESE AND OTHER AREAS IF YOU CAN I MIGHT TRY TAKING SOME CLASSES AND BUILDING SKILLS IN THESE AREAS BEFORE YOU GRADUATE YOU ALSO MIGHT SEEK OUT ALUMNI OF YOUR UNIVERSITY OR OTHERS IN YOUR BROADER SOCIAL NETWORK WHO HAVE MADE SIMILAR DECISIONS AFTER GETTING THEIR BACHELOR'S

HOWEVER I THINK YOU SHOULD ALSO BE CONCERNED WITH THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE FEELINGS YOU DESCRIBE IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE SUFFERING SOME SOCIAL ISOLATION STRUGGLES WITH MOTIVATION OVERALL NEGATIVITY AND POSSIBLY DEPRESSION DISCLAIMER I'M A PHYSICIST NOT A PSYCHOLOGIST AND I'M BASING THIS ON ONE REDDIN POST ONE OF THE MAIN SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION IS A LOSS OF INTEREST IN ACTIVITIES THAT YOU PREVIOUSLY ENJOYED FURTHERMORE THERE ISN'T ALWAYS A CLEAR-CUT REASON THAT A PERSON DEVELOPS DEPRESSION AT ANY GIVEN POINT IN THEIR LIFE WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS THAT YOUR PHYSICS STUDIES MAY BE THE REASON YOU'RE FEELING DEPRESSED BUT IT COULD ALSO BE THAT UNDERLYING DEPRESSION WITH OR WITHOUT AN APPARENT CAUSE IS THE REASON YOU NO LONGER ENJOY PHYSICS IF YOU HAVE UNDERLYING DEPRESSION THAT WILL FOLLOW YOU EVEN IF YOU CHANGE FIELDS AND YOU PROBABLY WON'T BE ANY HAPPIER

I'D HONESTLY RECOMMEND SEEKING HELP FROM A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO HELP YOU WORK THROUGH SOME OF THESE FEELINGS HOPEFULLY HELP YOU SORT OUT WHAT'S REALLY AT THE BOTTOM OF THEM AND GUIDE YOU TOWARDS A BETTER FUTURE FOR YOURSELF
FIRST GIVEN YOUR STRONG BACKGROUND IN PHYSICS I'D CONSIDER ENGINEERING IN A NUTSHELL PHYSICISTS STUDY THINGS ENGINEERS DESIGN AND BUILD THINGS INCLUDING EQUIPMENT USED BY PHYSICISTS AND OTHER SCIENTISTS ULTIMATELY ENGINEERING IS APPLIED SCIENCE AND A LOT OF ENGINEERING RELIES HEAVILY ON PHYSICS SO YOU'RE AHEAD OF THE GAME BOTH FIELDS ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ENGINEERS CAN'T DO THEIR JOBS WITHOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENTISTS GENERALLY CAN'T DO THEIR JOBS WITHOUT ENGINEERING BUT THE CREATIVE ASPECTS OF ENGINEERING MAKE IT MORE APPEALING TO MANY PEOPLE

SECOND LIKE YOU I LOVED AND WAS GOOD AT SCIENCE AND STARTED OUT IN CHEMICAL ENGINEERING BECAUSE I THOUGHT CHEMISTRY WAS FASCINATING I HAD AN AWESOME ADVANCED CHEMISTRY PROF MY FIRST YEAR BUT I REALIZED I WAS CRAP IN LACWORK AND ONE DAY I GOT A LOOK AT ALL THE PASTY UPPERCLASS PHYSICS STUDENTS INTERRED IN THE BOWELS OF THE CHEM BUILDING AND DECIDED IT WASN'T FOR ME I JUMPED TO COMPUTER ENGINEERING WHICH ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING WITH MORE OF A DIGITAL SOFTWARE FOCUS

PROFESSIONALLY I ENDED UP WORKING AS AN EMBEDDED SOFTWARE ENGINEER THESE DAYS PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING POWERED BY ELECTRICITY THAT IS MORE COMPLEX THAN A LIGHT BULB HAS GOT A LITTLE COMPUTER IN IT RUNNING SOFTWARE WRITTEN BY SOMEONE LIKE ME THAT INCLUDES NOT ONLY CONSUMER GADGETS AND EVERYTHING IN THE TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATION SECTORS BUT MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS OF ALL SIZES BIG SCIENCE PROJECTS LIKE THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER AND FUSION REACTORS CONTAIN THOUSANDS OF EMBEDDED DEVICES AS CAREERS GO IT'S INTERESTING CREATIVE FUN AND PROFITABLE

THIRD THE ABSOLUTE WORST CLASSES I TOOK WERE MY THREE SEMESTERS OF ENGINEERING PHYSICS TAUGHT IN THE PHYSICS DEPARTMENT SHAMEFULLY BAD THE OPEN SECRET WAS THAT THE PHYSICISTS LOOKED DOWN ON ENGINEERS AND GAVE US THE OLDEST COULDN'T GIVE A SHIT GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS ONE FOOT OUT THE DOOR PROF AND THIS WAS AT ONE OF THE BEST PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS IN THE US I'M SORRY TO HEAR YOUR EXPERIENCE WASN'T MUCH BETTER AS A PHYSICS MAJOR

WITH RESPECT TO THE SOCIAL ASPECTS ENGINEERING IS GENERALLY FAIRLY SOMETIMES INTENSELY SO MOST PEOPLE STILL WON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THAT'S TRUE WITH ANY SPECIALTY PROFESSION BUT YOU'LL HAVE MORE PEOPLE TO TALK ABOUT IT WITH AND IT'S GETTING BETTER ESPECIALLY IN FIELDS LIKE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING BUT IT'S STILL TOO MUCH OF A SAUSAGE FEST
HEY DON'T BE DISCOURAGED I'M A PHYSICS MAJOR TOO WITH A CONCENTRATION IN ASTRONOMY EVEN IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE MAKING NO PROGRESS JUST REALIZE THAT AT LEAST YOU'RE TAKING STEPS YOU HAVE TO BUILD A HOUSE ONE BRICK AT A TIME AND EVEN IF YOU JUST ADD A FEW BRICKS IT'S STILL CONTRIBUTING TO SOMETHING SUPER COOL YOU COULD FIND A NEW FUNDAMENTAL PARTICLE OR FIGURE OUT IF HUMANS CAN LIVE ON OTHER PLANETS BASED ON THEIR ATMOSPHERE AND DISTANCE FROM THEIR SUN SCIENCE IS ABOUT ANSWERING QUESTIONS AND ENDING UP WITH MORE QUESTIONS BUT YOU CAN LEAVE A LEGACY AND FIND OUT SOMETHING HUGE DON'T GIVE UP PHYSICS MAJORS ARE AWESOME AND I'M A GIRL SO ONE DAY I'LL HELP OUT WITH THE DEMOGRAPHIC LOL BUT NOT GRAD SCHOOL MAYBE JUST SEE YOUR OPTIONS AND FIND AN ALTERNATIVE I'M JUST A SOPHOMORE IN COLLEGE SO I CAN'T GIVE MUCH ADVICE BUT I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE COOL SO STICK WITH IT
IF YOU'RE APPROACHING THE END IT MIGHT BE WORTH FINISHING IT I KNOW IT SUCKS BUT IF YOU THINK YOU CAN GRADUATE WITH A DECENT GA FOR GRAD SCHOOL THEN STICK IT OUT AND GO FOR A MORE HANDS ON MAJOR FOR GRAD SCHOOL FOR INSTANCE MY ENVIRO ENGINEERING PROFESSOR WAS A PHYSICS STUDENT UNTIL HIS DOCTORATE WHEN HE STUDIED FLOW PATTERNS OF POLLUTANTS IN BAYS AND ESTUARIES I'VE HEARD SIMILAR CASES FOR OTHER PHYSICAL SCIENCE DOCTORATES YOU'VE MADE IT THIS FAR MIGHT AS WELL FINISH UP AND MAYBE TRY DOING AN INTERNSHIP WITH ANOTHER DISCIPLINE A FRIEND FROM COLLEGE WAS A MATH MAJOR BUT WE MET IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE BECAUSE HE WAS HELPING AN ATAMOSCO PROFESSOR WITH HIS ATMOSPHERIC MODEL PARAMETERS AND OBVIOUSLY NEEDED TO TAKE SOME CLASSES TO KNOW A LITTLE SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT HE WAS MODELING WITH THE PHYSICS DEGREE YOU'LL BE THE PICK OF THE LITER FOR A GRADATE PROGRAM FOR MATH FORMULA HEAVY MAJORS LIKE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE OR AEROSPACE ENGINEERING OR SHIT ANYTHING REALLY MY CALC PROFESSOR AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE GOT A DOCTORATE IN SOMETHING RANDOM LIKE BUSINESS JUST TO GET THE BUMP IN PAY AND HE SAID IT WAS SUPER EASY BECAUSE A LOT OF PROJECTS WERE GROUP PROJECTS SO THE REST OF THE GROUP DID ALL THE WORK AND GAVE HIM ALL THE MATH TO DO WHICH HE SAID WAS SUPER SIMPLE STUFF

UNTIL THEN FIND A HOBBY RELEASE LIKE ARCHERY OR SHOOTING WHICH WILL ALLOW YOU TO APPLY PHYSICS PRINCIPLES IN A FUN MANNER OR MAYBE SOMETHING MORE PHYSICALLY RIGOROUS BRAZILIAN JIUJITSU SEEMS TO APEAK TO MORE CEREBRAL TYPES SOMETHING THAT GETS YOU OUT OF YOUR PLACE IN A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT PHYSICALLY DEMANDING BUT ALSO TEACHES YOU TO RELAX TOO MAYBE EVEN JUST YOGA OR WEIGHT LIFTING OR JOGGING OR CYCLING OR SWIMMING THESE ARE ACTIVITIES WHERE YOU CAN HAVE TIME TO THINK BY YOURSELF BUT GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO INTERACT WITH PEOPLE THAT AREN'T PHYSICISTS AND MAYBE EVEN MORE LADIES PLUS THERE'S A LOT OF RESEARCH SUPPORTING THAT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IMPROVES PEOPLE'S OUTLOOK AND HELPS WITH DEPRESSION A LOT OF LADIES DO YOGA TOO AND IT'S BECOMING MORE COMMON FOR MEN ESPECIALLY ATHLETES
PRETTY ACCURATELY CAPTURES MY EXPERIENCE THE PHYSICS TEACHING STAFF AT MY UNIVERSITY WERE WITHOUT EXCEPTION INCREDIBLY ARROGANT PEOPLE WITH MASSIVE CHIPS ON THEIR SHOULDERS EVERY WORD OUT OF THEIR MOUTHS WAS AN ATTEMPT TO PROVE HOW SMART THEY WERE RATHER THAN HELP OR EXPLANATION I WAS GLAD TO HAVE ENGINEERING DOUBLE AS AN ALTERNATIVE OPTION
I REALLY FEEL YOUR PAIN I HAVE ONLY JUST STARTED A MAJOR IN PHYSICS IN MY UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE I'M AND HAVE ALSO TRIED STUDYING CHEMISTRY AND BIOCHEM AND I HAVE TO SAY THE LABS IN PHYSICS HAVE BEEN THE LEAST EXCITING COMPARED TO LABS IN OTHER SCIENCES BUT I HAVE FOUND PHYSICS TO BE MORE SOCIAL THAN MY OTHER SCIENCE CLASSES BECAUSE WE ALL BOND OVER HOW FUCKING FRUSTRATED WE ARE THAT EVERYTHING IS SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND ALSO SOME OF THE TEACHERS ARE CONDESCENDING BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THIS SHIT FOR YEARS AND DON'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO RELATE TO US WHEN WE DON'T UNDERSTAND SOMETHING THAT IS SO SIMPLE TO THEM SO THEY GET ANNOYED HAVING TO EXPLAIN IT TO EVERYONE A MILLION TIMES JUST TRY AND REMEMBER WHY IT WAS YOU CHOSE TO STUDY PHYSICS IN THE FIRST PLACE LIFE IS SO FUCKING AMAZING AND IF WE ARE EVEN ABLE GRAZE THE SURFACE OF UNDERSTANDING SOME OF MOST COMPLEX PROBLEMS THEN THAT IS ENOUGH FOR ME I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE BEING ABLE TO DISCOVER SOMETHING THAT HASN'T BEEN THOUGHT OF YET BECAUSE I WILL FIRST HAVE TO LEARN EVERYTHING THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN FIGURED OUT I AM SHATTERED THOUGH BECAUSE NOW THAT I AM ALMOST A YEAR INTO THIS MAJOR I HAVE JUST COME TO THE REALIZATION THAT THE ENTIRE COURSE THEY ARE TEACHING US IS CATERED TO THE RESEARCH MY UNIVERSITY IS DOING WHICH INCLUDES ZERO ASTROPHYSICS OR ASTRONOMY WHICH ARE THE ONLY TYPES OF PHYSICS I WANTED TO LEARN
AS A MAN WITH A PHD IN PHYSICS AND CURRENTLY WORKING IN RESEARCH I WOULD ADVISE YOU TO FINISH YOUR STUDIES WITH THE SKILL SET THAT YOU WILL OBTAIN IN THE STUDIES YOU CAN DO A LOT OF INTERESTING STUFF OUTSIDE SCIENCE AND THIS IS THE MAIN REASON WHY FINISHING IS A GOOD IDEA AND YOU CAN ALSO STAY IN SCIENCE IF YOU FEEL LIKE IT LATER
YOU ARE DEPRESSED BECAUSE YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND STUFF IT IS NORMAL NOT TO UNDERSTAND STUFF BECAUSE PHYSICS IS HARD WHEN WE ARE AT THIS LIFE IS HARD AS WELL THESE ARE JUST FACTS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS NOT TO TAKE FAILING TO UNDERSTAND PERSONALLY AND ACCEPT IS JUST AS A PART OF THE GAME THIS IN NO WAY REFLECTS UPON YOU AS BEING STUPID OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS SUCH THOUGHTS ARE ONLY DESTRUCTIVE WE ARE ALL DIFFERENT AND WE ALL NEED A DIFFERENT CLICK TO TRULY UNDERSTAND SOME THINGS I ONCE READ A CERTAIN PASSAGE FROM A BOOK OVER BEFORE I UNDERSTOOD WHAT IS GOING ON IN MY OWN WAY NEEDLES TO SAY THAT YOU HAVE PEOPLE PRETENDING TO BE VERY SMART SOME PEOPLE ARE TRULY SMART BUT NOT NEARLY AS MUCH AS YOU WOULD THINK MOST ARE JUST FAKING IT
SO PEOPLE TELL YOU IT GETS BETTER LATER SORRY TO BREAK THIS TO YOU BUT THIS IS PRETTY MUCH HOW SCIENCE IS STUDYING IS A GREAT TIME OF LIFE BECAUSE OF THE FREEDOM FROM BUT IT CAN NOT POSSIBLY GET BETTER WHEN YOU HAVE A WIFE KIDS AND NEED TO BULLSHIT ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO AND HOW IT IS THE BEST THING EVER ONLY TO GET FUNDING

YOUR THOUGHTS ARE PERFECTLY NORMAL AND YOU HAVE NOTHING TO BE DEPRESSED ABOUT BEING STUPID ETC BECAUSE THIS IS NOT TRUE IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE EVEN TO FINISH PHD AND DECIDE THEN WHAT TO DO I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DID A PHD IN PHYSICS SOME OF THEM STAYED IN SCIENCE AS I DID BUT SOME WENT ON TO INDUSTRY AND LET ME TELL YOU THAT PHYSICISTS CAN WORK A LOT OF DIFFERENT JOBS BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS IN BANKS IN PROGRAMMING IN ENGINEERING ETC
NOBODY EVER UNDERSTANDS OR IS INTERESTED IN WHAT I AM SAYING IF I BRING UP PHYSICS IN CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHERS PEOPLE WHO STUDIED GEOLOGY MEDICINE BUSINESS ETC ALWAYS DO SEEM TO HAVE INTERESTING SUBJECTS TO BRING UP

NOT SOMETHING I'VE NOTICED DON'T WANT TO RULE IT OUT

2 LABORATORY WORK SUCKS YOU OFTEN SIT IN A DARK ROOM WITHOUT SUNSHINE AND OFTEN WITH A LOT OF NOISY EQUIPMENT IT'S ALMOST NEVER A AS YOU DON'T INTERACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE BUT JUST YOUR LAB EQUIPMENT

DEPENDS ON THE UNIVERSITY FOR MY DEGREE WE WERE ONLY IN A DARK ROOM WHEN IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY AND FIRST YEAR WAS IN PAIRS SECOND YEAR ONE SEMESTER IN PAIRS AND ONE SEMESTER WAS AN ELECTRONICS EXPERIMENT IN A GROUP OF FOUR THIRD YEAR WAS A DISSERTATION WHICH WAS OBVIOUSLY ALONE BUT AS MINE WAS CODING WAS MORE TIME IN THE LIBRARY MEETING YOUR SUPERVISOR AS PER ANY OTHER COURSE

SOCIAL INTERACTION OVERALL IS JUST VERY LOW PREPARING AN EXPERIMENT WRITING A REPORT STUDYING NEW PHENOMENA ANALYSING DATA CREATING A MODEL MOST OF THE TIME IT'S JUST YOU DOING YOUR OWN THING

MAINLY COVERED THIS ABOVE DEPENDS ON THE UNI

ACCOMPLISHMENTS DON'T FEEL REWARDING AND AREN'T INTERESTING ON THEIR OWN AT THE END OF A WHOLE EXPERIMENT THE CONCLUSION COULD BE I CANNOT MEASURE THIS OR THAT PHENOMENA ACCURATE ENOUGH WITH THIS EQUIPMENT WELL AWESOME I GUESS YAY

THIS IS WHAT LABS IN FIRST YEAR WAS LIKE IT GOT MUCH BETTER IN 2ND YEAR AND THE DISSERTATION WAS EXTREMELY REWARDING

UNINTERESTING PEOPLE TO STUDY WORK WITH MOST PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE VERY LITTLE HOBBIES STUDENT LIFE BESIDES PHYSICS PHYSICS ALSO SEEMS TO TAKE A HUGE CHUNK OF YOUR TIME MORE THAN OTHER STUDIES DO NOT TO MENTION IT'S A SAUSAGEFEST WITH IN MY YEAR OF THE PEOPLE BEING MALE

IT DOES TAKE UP A MASSIVE CHUNK OF YOUR TIME AND THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO WILL HAVE NO INTERESTS OTHER THAN PHYSICS BUT THERE WILL ALSO BE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DO IT MAY TAKE A WEEK OR TWO TO WORK OUT WHO'S WHO IN THAT SENSE BUT AFTERWARDS IT'S SOUND AS FOR THE AMOUNT OF BLOKES THAT'S UNFORTUNATELY SOMETHING THAT YOU'LL FIND THROUGHOUT SCIENCE UNFORTUNATELY MY UNI WAS ALSO ISH ENGINEERING AND CS ARE EVEN WORSE AND MATHS IS SIMILAR

STUDYING AND FINISHING ASSIGNMENTS IS OVERALL JUST A VERY FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE YOU OFTEN GET STUCK WITH NO IDEA WHAT TO DO TO GET TO THE SOLUTION YOU OFTEN DON'T UNDERSTAND SOMETHING AT ALL AND IF YOU'RE NOT CONSTANTLY CONCENTRATED YOU GET LOST AND BEHIND REALLY QUICKLY

AGREE WITH THIS IT TAKES A WHILE FOR IT TO JUST CLICK

PROFESSORS TEACHERS SEEM UNINTERESTED AND ARE REALLY BAD IN EXPLAINING STUFF I KEEP HEARING STUFF LIKE OH THAT'S TRIVIAL THAT'S TRIVIAL THAT'S TRIVIAL TRIVIAL TRIVIAL TRIVIAL I'LL SKIP THAT EVERYTHING IS TRIVIAL AND EASY TO THEM AND THEY DO NOT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S DEFINITELY NOT TO THEIR STUDENTS SERIOUSLY IT IS NOT UNCOMMON TO HAVE A 2 HOUR CLASS AND OF THE STUDENTS INCLUDING ME WALKING OUT OKE I HAD NO IDEA WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE LAST MINUTES GUESS I'LL HAVE TO STUDY IT ALL BY MYSELF AT HOME AND HOPE I UNDERSTAND LITERALLY EVERY DAMN TIME AND ASKING THE TEACHER TO EXPLAIN IT BETTER NEVER HELPS AS THEIR EXPLANATIONS ARE OFTEN JUST BAD THEY JUST MAKE YOU FEEL DUMB AND IT'S FRUSTRATING TO BE HONEST

JUST LIKE ANY COURSE THIS DEPENDS ON THE UNI I HAD SOME BAD LECTURERS SOME REALLY GOOD LECTURERS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME EVERYBODY ON ANY OTHER COURSE I TALKED TO

AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU DON'T EVEN SEEM TO GET PAID THAT MUCH FOR GOING THROUGH ALL OF THIS AFTERALL THAT'S WHAT A JOB IS FOR AND MORE OFTEN THAN NOT EVEN IF YOU LOVE PHYSICS IF YOU ARE GOING TO DO IT HOURS A WEEK YOU WILL GET BORED OF IT AND YOU ARE GOING TO START HATING YOUR JOB SOME EXTRA MONEY TO HAVE A LESS STRESSFUL LIFE IS ALWAYS WELCOME THEN

YEAH IT'S DEFINITELY FAR FROM THE BEST DEGREE TO STUDY IN TERMS OF MONEY

BASICALLY WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS THAT WHILE THESE FACTORS COULD BE A CAUSE OF THE DEGREE IT COULD IN MY OPINION MORE LIKELY BE A CAUSE OF WHERE YOU ARE STUDYING I'M NOT TRYING TO CONVINCE YOU TO STAY STUDYING PHYSICS DO WHAT YOU THINKS BEST BUT KEEP AN OPEN MIND MASTERS ARE MUCH MORE SPECIFIC TO THE PARTS YOU WANT TO DO AND OFTEN EASIER BECAUSE OF IT THE LAB WORK ESPECIALLY PREFER THEORETICAL CODING CHOOSE A PROJECT THAT FOCUSES ON THAT AND PICK ONE WITH A GOOD SUPERVISOR AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE
TO ALL YOUR CONCERNS NO KIDDING HAVE YOU EVER MET A PHYSICIST HA HAA AAAAAA
A LITTLE TIP NEVER FEEL TO DUMB TO ASK SOMETHING WHEN YOU DONT UNDERSTAND SOMETHING IN THE COURSES

IT IS A GOOD DECISION A PHYSICIST IS THE GENERAL TOOL FOR SCIENCE
THIS IS WHY I CHOSE TO BECOME A MEDICAL PHYSICIST IN ONCOLOGY EXTERNAL RADIO THERAPY

NOBODY WILL BE INTERESTED IN HEARING WHAT YOU DO EXCEPT PEOPLE WORKING IN ONCOLOGY OR RADIOLOGY BUT I ALWAYS SAY I WORK WITH CANCER TREATMENTS AND STOP THERE

2 THE WORK IS VERY PRACTICAL CLINICAL THERE IS ALMOST NO LABORATORY WORK SOME MEASUREMENTS AND CALIBRATIONS ON THE TREATMENT MACHINES BUT THAT S JUST WELCOMED VARIATION IN THE CLINICAL WORKFLOW

SOCIAL INTERACTIONS IS VERY IMPORTANT WE WORK AS A MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM WITH PHYSICISTS ANUSES DOCTORS ENGINEERS AND MANAGEMENT AND EVERY SO OFTEN WE PARTICIPATE IN TREATMENT AND MEET THE PATIENTS

THE ACCOMPLISHMENT IS TO HELP THE PATIENTS FIGHT THE CANCER OR TO RELIEVE THE PAIN

I FOUND HAVING A GOAL FOR MY STUDY TO BE A MAGICAL PHYSICIST HELPED ME MOTIVATE THRU REALLY DIFFICULT COURSES THE END COURSES ARE MORE SPECIFIC FOR MEDICAL PHYSICS AND FUN PRACTICAL THE GENDER DISTRIBUTION IN MEDICAL PHYSICS IS ALMOST EQUAL MEN AND WOMEN ESPECIALLY FOR THE LAST YEARS WHICH IS NICE AND IT S OFTEN QUITE A SOCIAL BUNCH I GUESS IT S THE CLINICAL PART THAT BRINGS THESE KIND OF PEOPLE

THE STUDY IS DIFFICULT BUT TRY TO WORK WITH YOUR CLASSMATES AND DO THERE TOGETHER YOU HAVE TO LEARN IT FOR YOURSELF BUT IT HELPS WHEN YOU GET STUCK

SOME UNINTERESTED TEACHERS YOU JUST HAVE TO BEAR WITH FUCK THOSE OLD FARTS SET YOUR GOAL AND DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO TO GET THERE BY YOURSELF THEN
MEDICAL PHYSICISTS ARE QUITE WELL PAID AND JOBS ARE QUITE EASY TO GET DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE

NICE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS BEST OF LUCK WHATEVER YOU CHOSE DO GO

DON'T MEMORIZE UNDERSTAND
PHYSICS INVOLVES A LOT OF MATHEMATICS SO READING YOUR TEXTBOOK AND GOING OVER YOUR NOTES IS NOT AND WILL NEVER BE ENOUGH IT'S NOT A FIELD LIKE BIOLOGY WHERE MEMORIZING THINGS WILL GET YOU THROUGH IT YOU NEED TO FUNDAMENTALLY UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPTS AND CONTINUALLY APPLY THEM IN PROBLEM SETS AND EXERCISES

JUST LIKE MATH PRACTICE IS KEY PRACTICE A LOT IDENTIFY WHERE YOU'RE STRUGGLING THE MOST AND ASK FOR EXPLANATIONS ON THAT TOPIC FROM YOUR TEACHER FOR THIS I'D RECOMMEND CHECKING OUT THE FEYNMAN TECHNIQUE
WE'RE GONNA NEED MORE INFORMATION I'M IN A SIMILAR POSITION I'M IN HIGH SCHOOL STUDYING PHYSICS AND THE BEST WAY I LEARN IS BY JUST DOING HEAPS OF QUESTIONS IF I GET ONE WRONG I WOULD TRY AND LOOK INTO WHY I GOT IT WRONG INSTEAD OF JUST LEAVING IT AS MARKED WRONG WHAT DO YOU HAVE THE MOST TROUBLE WITH EXPLAINING CONCEPTS OR APPLYING CONCEPTS PHYSICS IS ONE OF THE FEW SUBJECTS THAT REQUIRES SOUND EXPLANATION AND MATHEMATICAL SKILLS
THE BEST METHOD THAT HAS ALWAYS WORKED FOR ME IF THERE'S SOMETHING I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND CONCEPTUALLY IS TO WRITER MY OWN LECTURE NOTES ON THE TOPIC I WRITE OUT BASICALLY HOW I WOULD TEACH THE TOPIC TO SOMEONE ELSE IN MY OWN WORDS WITH FULL DERIVATIONS I HAVE A PHD IN PHYSICS AND AM A PROFESSIONAL RESEARCHER AND I STILL DO IT

THAT IS FOR IF I'M REALLY HAVING CONCEPTUAL TROUBLE WITH SOMETHING IF THE ISSUE IS THAT THE CONCEPTS ARE FINE BUT YOU CAN'T EQUATE THAT TO SUCCESS ON TESTS AND SUCH THE ONLY OPTION IS PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE DO EVERY SINGLE PROBLEM IN THE BACK OF THE TEXTBOOK CHAPTER THEN DO THEM AGAIN THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER WAY TO IMPROVE

IF YOU LOOK OVER THE MATERIAL AND SAY YEP I GET THAT AND THAT'S ALL YOU DO YOU WILL NOT REMEMBER ANY OF IT COME TEST TIME OR BE ABLE TO SOLVE PROBLEMS USING YOU JUST WON'T PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE
DOING A LOT OF PROBLEMS HELPS YOU MUST ALSO LAY OUT THESE PROBLEMS CLEARLY WHAT DO YOU KNOW AND WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO FIND FROM THERE DRAW DIAGRAMS UNDERLINE THE QUESTION PREDICT THE ANSWER ETC NOW THAT'S FOR PROBLEMS FOR OTHER MORE GENERAL QUESTIONS TRY BREAKING DOWN THE QUESTION TO MAKE IT AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE AND WHEN YOU STUDY PRETEND YOU ARE TEACHING A CLASS AND EVEN BETTER PRETEND THAT ONE STUDENT DOES NOT GET IT MAKE IT AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE
I ALWAYS FOUND THAT IF I LEARNED SOMETHING THAT I PREVIOUSLY FOUND DIFFICULT OR DIDN'T UNDERSTAND BEFORE WAS TO TRY AND EXPLAIN IT TO SOMEONE ELSE SOME AREAS OF PHYSICS I COULDN'T LEARN BY READING I HAD TO DO THEM PLAY WITH THE EQUATIONS AND SEE WHAT HAPPENED WHEN I TOOK SOMETHING TO LIMITS THOUGH IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHICH BIT YOU'RE FINDING DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND IS IT THE MATHS ASPECT OR IS IT MORE OF A CASE OF I HAVE THIS SYSTEM I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT SHOULD DO TYPE OF THING
ONE OF THE BEST SCIENCE SOURCES EVER LOVE QUANTA
IT LOOKS APPROXIMATELY LIKE THIS HETP
STUDYING FOR MY SAT 2 PHYSICS TEST HOPING TO GET IN SOMEWHERE GOOD FOR UNDERGRAD I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THE AMOUNT OF CONTENT IN THE EXAMINATION THERE'S EVEN SOME RELATIVITY APPARENTLY
STUDYING GR FOR AN EXAM WHILE STUDYING FOR AGRE WHILE STUDYING FOR GRE WHILE PRETENDING TO KNOW ENGLISH WELL ENOUGH FOR TOEFL WHILE TRYING NOT TO THINK HOW MUCH WORK I'LL HAVE TO DO IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS

TL R CRYING INSIDE
STILL STUDYING FOR MY MATH EXAM
THIS WEEK IS HIGH SPEED VIDEO WEEK PLANNING TO GO FROM FPS UP TO OR MORE IF WE HAVE ENOUGH LIGHT
PHYSICS WISE I AM REVIEWING SOME QM AFT AND GRAMMAR I MIGHT END UP READING SOME OF JIM GATES TEXT ON SUSY SOON TOO I AM MEETING WITH A SENIOR PHYSICIST IN DEPARTMENT TO DISCUSS STUFF LIKE TAKING GRADUATE AFT GR AND ST HERE AT SOME POINT AND OR DOING AN INDEPENDENT STUDY I THINK THE SCHEDULING FOR THAT WILL COME THIS WEEK AND THE MEETING NEXT

I'M ALSO DOING A TON OF MATHEMATICS
FINE TUNING MY ADDBACK ROUTINE TO EFFECTIVELY IMPROVE MY GAMMA RAY EFFICIENCY
JUST STARTED MY PHD IN THE THEORY OF OPEN QUANTUM SYSTEMS WITH INTERACTIONS YESTERDAY ENJOYING SHORT LIMBO PERIOD BEFORE FULL WORKLOAD KICKS IN IN TERMS OF PHYSICS I'M GETTING BIGGY WITH THE DICKE MODEL
WITH MY PRETTY AMATEUR OPINION I WOULD ASSUME THAT THE WAYS WOULD NOT PROPAGATE LIKE WATER WAVES BUT THERE WOULD STILL BE SOME MOTION PHYSICALLY THOSE BALLIST BALLS ARE COMPRESSIBLE AND RELATIVELY LIGHT SO THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO ACT LIKE WATER WITH IS APPROXIMATED TO A PRETTY GOOD DEGREE TO BE INCOMPRESSIBLE
I IMAGINE IT WOULD LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS

THE WATER WAVES SHOULD PROPAGATE OR ELSE WHERE ELSE WOULD THE ENERGY GO AND WILL BE A COMBINATION OF TRANSVERSE AND LONGITUDINAL WAVES THE OBJECTS FLOATING ON TOP ON THE OTHER HAND WILL JUST BE TRANSVERSE WAVES BECAUSE THEIR LONGITUDINAL MOTION IS CONSTRAINED

EDIT MISINTERPRETED THE QUESTION
TRY FOR A PDF OR TRY YOUR LIBRARY

I HAD A COPY BUT I SOLD IT
YOU COULD USE A THERMOELECTRIC DEVICE BUT IT WOULD BE VERY BAD AT REMOVING THE HEAT FROM THE PC RESULTING IN THE CPU OVERHEATING
THERE ARE A FEW WAYS TO CONVERT HEAT INTO ELECTRICITY BUT I THINK YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A DEVICE CHIP IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EFFICIENT BY ANY MEANS AND IT'S NOT GOING TO CONVERT A WHOLE LOT OF HEAT INTO ELECTRICITY ALSO IT WORKS ON TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE SO YOU WOULD HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO EFFICIENTLY COOL DOWN THE COLD SIDE OF THE DEVICE

ALL IN ALL NOT REALLY

BEST YOU CAN REALLY HOPE FOR IS MAYBE HAVING A LITTLE TOY STERLING ENGINE SPIN AROUND AND ENTERTAIN YOU

EDIT IF YOU WANT TO RUN A LIQUID LINE TO A ROW OF PELTIER CHIPS YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET SOMETHING BUT THE PUMPS TO MOVE THE LIQUID WOULD USE MORE ELECTRICITY THAN YOU WOULD GET
THERMOELECTRIC ENERGY HARVESTING IS AN OPTION BUT IT'S NOT REALLY WORTH IT YOU'D GET SOMETHING LIKE MICROWATT EVEN AT CARNOT EFFICIENCY THE HIGHEST EFFICIENCY OF ANY HEAT ENGINE ALLOWED BY THE LAWS OF THERMODYNAMICS YOU COULD ONLY GET A

KELVIN KELVIN POWER CONVERSION EFFICIENCY IN SUCH A SCENARIO

THERE'S SERIOUS RESEARCH INTO USING THERMOELECTRIC IN REVERSE AS COOLING DEVICES FOR CHIPS THAT CAN BE GROWN RIGHT INTO THE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT BUT IT'S A WASTE FOR ENERGY HARVESTING

EDIT PLAYING WITH THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE I BELIEVE THE FIGURE OF MERIT THE ONE NUMBER THAT QUANTIFIES THE EFFICIENCY OF A GIVEN THERMOELECTRIC MATERIAL OF THE BEST COMMERCIAL TES ARE ABOUT THE BEST LAB ONES ARE THAT CORRESPONDS TO SQRT SQRT CARNOT EFFICIENCY 2 EFFICIENCY SO THE BEST STORE BOUGHT THERMOELECTRIC WOULD HAVE A 2 CONVERSION EFFICIENCY IN THAT SCENARIO IT JUST AIN'T WORTH IT
I'VE NEVER GIVEN ANY SERIOUS CONSIDERATION TO DOING ANYTHING ELSE

THEY SAY THEY FEEL LIKE FREAKING IDIOTS EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE APPLYING FOR GRADUATE SCHOOL

EVERYONE FEELS THAT WAY AND IT'S SORT OF TRUE TO BE BRUTALLY HONEST COMING STRAIGHT OUT OF UNDERGRAD YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW ANYTHING YET YOU HAVE LOTS OF SKILLS HOPEFULLY THAT YOU CAN BUILD ON IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT CAREER PATHS BUT YOU'RE FAR FROM AN EXPERT IN ANY PARTICULAR THING

GRADUATE SCHOOL DOES SEEM AN INTERESTING INVESTMENT EVEN IF IT IS FOR JUST A MASTERS

GRAD SCHOOL IN PHYSICS CHEMISTRY ISN'T REALLY AN INVESTMENT AT LEAST NOT IN A MONETARY SENSE TUITION IS TYPICALLY FREE AND YOU GET PAID ENOUGH TO LIVE OFF OF SO THE ONLY THING YOU'RE SPENDING IS YOUR TIME NOT MONEY
TO ANSWER YOUR ORIGINAL QUESTION I JUST KNEW I LOVED TAKING PHYSICS CLASSES I TOOK ALMOST EVERY SINGLE THEORY CLASS OFFERED BY MY UNDERGRAD FRESHMAN SEQUENCE THERMO MATH METHODS E M QUANTUM STAT MECH CLASSICAL MECHANICS CONDENSED MATTER ATOMIC PARTICLE GR SO BY THE TIME I FINISHED UNDERGRAD I KNEW THAT I LOVED STUDYING PHYSICS FROM A BOOK BUT I WAS WORRIED THAT I MIGHT NOT ACTUALLY ENJOY WORKING IN THE FIELD I DID RESEARCH AS AN UNDERGRAD BUT I WASN'T SUPER PUMPED ABOUT IT GRAD SCHOOL IS PAID FOR IN PHYSICS SO I JUST FIGURED IF I HATED RESEARCH I'D LEAVE GRAD SCHOOL AND FIND A JOB FORTUNATELY I REALLY ENJOY MY RESEARCH

HOW DOES THAT EVEN WORK DOES HE REALLY JUST HAVE TO LOVE VIROLOGY AND NMR THAT MUCH PEOPLE ARE NOT AT ALL WHO I PICTURED THEM TO BE UNDERGRADUATE OR GRADUATE EVEN SOME OF THE PROFESSORS AND YES I AM CONVINCED THAT MOST ARE NOT SOCIALLY INEPT PIS WHO PUT A DRAIN ON THE TEAM THEY SEEM TO BE AN OUTLIER

I'LL ANSWER THIS IN TWO PARTS
I DO BELIEVE YOU HAVE TO BE PASSIONATE ABOUT YOUR RESEARCH TO MAKE IT THROUGH GRAD SCHOOL YOU'RE SPENDING YEARS OR MORE AT A PRETTY LOW PAY COMPARED TO WHAT YOU COULD GET IN INDUSTRY WORKING ON ONE SPECIFIC PROJECT ADDITIONALLY YOU HAVE DEADLINES TO MEET YOU NEED TO HAVE RESULTS TO KEEP YOUR FUNDING YOU MAY HAVE COLLABORATORS THAT NEED YOU TO FINISH SOMETHING BY A CERTAIN DATE YOU HAVE CONFERENCES THAT YOU'LL WRITE THE ABSTRACT TO MONTHS IN ADVANCE PROMISING DATA AND THEN REALIZE A MONTH BEFORE THE CONFERENCE THAT THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN GET DATA BY THE TIME YOU GIVE YOUR TALK THERE'S JUST A LOT OF THINGS THAT MAKE GRAD SCHOOL PRETTY STRESSFUL AND IF YOU DON'T LOVE WHAT YOU DO THEN I PERSONALLY WOULDN'T THINK IT'S WORTH IT

2 BE AWARE OF THE SHITTY PROFESSOR YOU'RE RIGHT THAT MOST PROFESSORS AREN'T SHITTY BUT IT'S GOOD THAT YOU'VE NOTICED THEY EXIST I WOULD VERY STRONGLY STRESS THAT IF YOU DECIDE TO PURSUE PHYSICS GRAD SCHOOL BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO WORK FOR A PROFESSOR YOU SHOULD TALK TO AS MANY OF THEIR STUDENTS AS YOU CAN AND ASK OTHER STUDENTS AT THE SCHOOL ABOUT SAID PROFESSOR AS A GRAD STUDENT I DON'T WANT NEW PEOPLE COMING IN AND WORKING FOR SHITTY PROFESSORS I LOVE WHAT I DO I WANT YOU TO LOVE WHAT YOU DO I'LL BE VERY BLUNT AND TELL YOU IF A PROFESSOR IS A DICK AND MANY OF MY PEERS ARE THE SAME SO DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT THAT IT'S A REAL PROBLEM BUT IT CAN BE AVOIDED UNLESS YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH SOMETHING SUPER SPECIFIC ONLY DONE BY ONE OR TWO PEOPLE SOMETIMES LIFE JUST SUCKS

TL R I KNEW I LOVED PHYSICS CLASSES PRETTY EARLY ON IN UNDERGRAD I WASN'T CONVINCED I LOVED WORKING IN PHYSICS UNTIL GRAD SCHOOL YOU CAN AVOID WORKING FOR SHITTY PROFESSORS IF YOU TALK TO STUDENTS IN THE DEPARTMENT THAT PROFESSORS WORKS IN USUALLY IF A PROFESSOR IS SHITTY GRAD STUDENTS WILL TELL YOU WE DON'T WANT YOU TO BE MISERABLE
PROBABLY AFTER WATCHING A FEW PBS SPACETIME VIDEOS I WAS LIKE HOLY FUCKING SHIT NO WAY REALLY THAT'S THE WAY THINGS ARE
YOU JUST KIND OF KNOW I WAS KIND OF LIKE YOU APATHETIC AND BORED AS SHIT ABOUT EVERYTHING PHYSICS WAS REALLY THE ONLY THING I CARED ABOUT AND WELL I LIKED MATH BECAUSE I WAS PRETTY GOOD AT IT BUT I NEVER REALLY HAD ANY ROLE MODELS NOT UNTIL COLLEGE AND MY PHYSICS ROLE MODELS ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN AND NEVER REALLY DID HOME EXPERIMENTS

ANYWAYS THE FIRST TELL-TALE SIGN EVEN IF I DIDN'T KNOW IT YET WAS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND IT'S THE ONLY SCHOOLWORK RELATED THING THAT STILL MAKES A CLEAR PICTURE IN MY MIND IT WAS AN EXPERIMENT ON HEAT TRANSFER EVEN THOUGH YEAR OLD ME HAD NO CLUE WHAT THAT WAS WHERE WE PUT BUTTER AND A PAPER CLIP AND STUCK EACH END IN A HOT AND COLD WATER CUP I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE COOLEST THING EVER ANYWAYS FAST FORWARD AND I REALIZED I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE BEAUTY OF APPLIED MATH THE NATURAL WORLD AND THE WAY IT WORKS AND HOW CONTENT I AM KNOWING THE WORLD TURNS THE WAY IT DOES

I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'LL KNOW I FEEL LIKE IN ANY FIELD THE MORE YOU LEARN THE MORE YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT YOU DON'T KNOW MUCH THE UNIVERSE IS VAST AND THERE IS STILL SO MUCH TO EXPLORE AND FIGURE OUT ALSO STUDENTS AND PROFESSORS ARE PEOPLE TOO PEOPLE ARE WEIRD AND DIFFERENT AND QUIRKY AND THAT'S OKAY I THINK NORMAL IS TOO PREDICABLE AND BORING AND YES SOME PEOPLE DO LOVE VIROLOGY AND NMR OR THE UNDERLYING SCIENCE BEHIND IT THAT MUCH WHEN THEY DEDICATE THE MAJORITY OF THEIR LIVES TO IT
THERE'S A GOOD EXPLANATION HERE
EVERY TWO YEARS THERE IS THE CAM GRADUATE PHYSICS CONFERENCE IN ALTERNATING COUNTRIES THE ORGANIZERS BASED IN MEXICO I THINK MIGHT HAVE SOME USEFUL INFO
PHYSICS STUDENT FROM VENEZUELA I'VE BEEN LURKING AROUND FOR A LONG TIME BUT NEVER REALLY LEAVE COMMENTS
I'M FROM BRAZIL ACTUALLY I'M STUDDING TO DO SOMETHING RELATION TO PHYSICS AND COMPUTATION
I'M FROM CHILE
BRAZIL IN OFTEN FILLED UP WITH LA FOLKS YOU SHOULD LOOK IT UP
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY'RE DIFFERENT THINGS THERE'S NO REASON FOR THE CROSS-SECTION TO BE THE SAME BETWEEN DIFFERENT ISOTOPES OR DIFFERENT ELEMENTS

AS FOR THE GOVERNING FACTORS IT'S COMPLICATED FIRST OF ALL ARE A FUNCTION OF ENERGY THE PROBABILITY OF NEUTRON CAPTURE CAN VARY VERY STRONGLY WITH THE ENERGY OF THE INCIDENT NEUTRON

BUT FOR A GIVEN ENERGY THE CAPTURE CROSS-SECTION WILL DEPEND ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE NUCLEUS IS THERE A RESONANT STATE AT THE RIGHT ENERGY IF SO THE CROSS-SECTION WILL BE HIGHER
CROSS SECTIONS ARE DRIVEN BY THE PHYSICS OF THE NUCLEUS WHICH WILL CHANGE BASED ON THE NUMBER OF NEUTRONS IN THERE FOR DIFFERENT ISOTOPES RATHER THAN THE CHEMISTRY WHICH IS HOW THE ELECTRONS INTERACT WITH THEIR ENVIRONMENT DIFFERENT ISOTOPES OF A GIVEN ELEMENT WILL HAVE THE SAME CHEMISTRY MOSTLY BECAUSE THEY'LL USUALLY HAVE THE SAME ELECTRONIC ORBITAL STRUCTURE BUT JUST WHEN YOU LOOK AT NUCLEAR PHYSICS AND CROSS SECTIONS CAN YOU SEE THEIR DIFFERENCES
NUCLEAR STRUCTURE ARGUMENTS BORON HAS AN UNPAIRED NEUTRON IT CAPTURES AN INCIDENT NEUTRON BECOMING BORON AND CLOSING THE SHELL AND DOESN'T WANT TO CAPTURE ANYMORE NEUTRONS

HAWKING RADIATION IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY CAN BE PROVEN THROUGH BLACK BODY RADIATION AND THOSE RELATED EQUATIONS SINCE A BLACK HOLE IS A PERFECT BLACK BODY I WROTE A VERY BRIEF PAPER COVERING THIS AS A FINAL PROJECT FOR MY THERMAL CLASSICAL IT ALL STARTED WITH THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS
THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR MODERN SCIENCE GIVEN THAT MANY TECHNOLOGIES DEPEND ON AN ACCURATE MEASUREMENT OF THE KILOGRAM

CAN SOMEONE PLEASE GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF A TECHNOLOGY THAT REQUIRES THIS HIGH SENSITIVITY
THE RESEARCHERS PLACED A KNOWN MASS ON ONE END OF THE SCALE AND THEN COUNTERBALANCED IT BY SENDING AN ELECTRIC CURRENT THROUGH A MOVABLE COIL OF WIRE SUSPENDED IN A MAGNETIC FIELD THEY THEN USED THAT ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE TO MEASURE CONSTANT DOWN TO AN ACCURACY OF PARTS PER BILLION

HOW DO THEY KNOW THE MASS OF THE KNOWN MASS WOULDN'T IT ALSO HAVE TO BE KNOWN TO AN ACCURACY OF PARTS PER BILLION

I ASSUME NOT BUT DON'T KNOW ENOUGH TO KNOW WHY
DUE TO CONFINEMENT IN CD QUARKS AND GLUONS THAT ARE PRODUCED IN HIGH ENERGY COLLISIONS CANNOT EXIST FREELY AND INSTEAD FORM COLLIMATED JETS OF HADRONS

THESE JETS CONTAIN USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THE BEHAVIOUR OF CD BUT MATCHING PROPERTIES OF EXPERIMENTALLY OBSERVED JETS TO PERTURBATIVE CD CALCULATIONS IS DIFFICULT THE DEFINITION OF A JET DEPENDS STRONGLY ON THE DETECTOR AND ALGORITHMS USED TO RECONSTRUCT IT AND THE SUBSEQUENT HARMONISATION WITHIN THE JET ARE GOVERNED BY THE CD REGIME WHERE CALCULATIONS ARE EVEN HARDER TO MAKE AGGREGATE PROPERTIES OF EVENTS WITH JETS OF WHICH THE THRUST IS ONE ARE FAIRLY ROBUST TOWARDS THESE THINGS SO CAN BE USED TO COMPARE THEORETICAL PREDICTIONS WITH EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS AND MEASURE PARAMETERS OF CD SUCH AS THE RUNNING COUPLING CONSTANT

NOWADAYS AS FAR AS I KNOW I AM NOT AN EXPERT IN JET PHYSICS THE USE OF MORE ROBUST JET RECONSTRUCTION ALGORITHMS AND IMPROVEMENTS IN CD CALCULATIONS AND EVENT GENERATORS MEAN THAT EVENT SHAPE VARIABLES LIKE THRUST ARE LESS IMPORTANT THAN THEY ONCE WERE IF YOU WANT TO DO THINGS WITH JETS THAT SAID THAT EVENT SHAPES ARE WELL PREDICTED NOW BY PERTURBATIVE CD CALCULATIONS MEANS THAT THE CD JET BACKGROUND TO OTHER INTERESTING PHYSICS PROCESSES SUCH AS TOP QUARK AND TAU LEPTON DECAYS CAN BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST MUCH MORE EASILY EXPERIMENTALLY AS THE DISTRIBUTIONS IN THESE VARIABLES WILL BE QUITE DIFFERENT

HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WRITING ABOUT QM IS RISKY IT'S GOOD THAT U CHOSE TO AVOID IT CAUSE USUALLY PEOPLE GET IT WRONG

I'D SUGGEST THE STAR FORMATION PROCESS AND HOW THEY EVOLVE AND DIE DEPENDING ON THEIR MASSACHUSETTS BLACK HOLES NEUTRON STARS YOU CAN ANALYZE THE WAY THEY PRODUCE ENERGY FUSION AND PRESENT A SIMPLE DIAGRAM ABOUT THE ELEMENTS AND THE RADIATION THEY EMIT AFTER THE FUSION

THE STANDARD MODEL IS ALSO AN INTERESTING TOPIC AND YOU DO NOT NEED THE QM TO EXPLAIN IT AT A HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THE FORCES OF NATURE HOW THEY WORK VIRTUAL PARTICLES AND HOW THE STRONG FORCE KEEPS THE NUCLEUS TOGETHER

YOU COULD TRY TO EXPLAIN MAGNETISM IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS IT SEEMS AND TALK ABOUT FERROMAGNETISM ANTIFERROMAGNETISM DIAMAGNETISM AND FERROMAGNETISM THERE ARE SOME PRETTY COOL DEMONSTRATIONS FOR THIS AND IT'S A COOL WAY TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE BASIC CONCEPTS IN E MASCULINE

A LOT OF WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY BELOW IS GOING TO INVOLVE QUANTUM MECHANICS ON A BASE LEVEL CAUSE IT'S OPTICS BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO INTO DEPTH WITH THE QUANTUM MECHANICS TO EXPLAIN IT

THERE'S THE PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT WHICH EXPLAINS SOLAR CELLS THIS WAS DISCOVERED BY EINSTEIN WHICH HE RECEIVED THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR I ASSUME MOST HIGH SCHOOL KIDS THINK HE WON IT FOR SPECIAL RELATIVITY WHICH HE DIDN'T YOU CAN ALSO EXPAND THIS TO ALSO TALK ABOUT THE DUALITY

ALSO WITH THE DUALITY YOU CAN USE THIS TO SHOW HOW YOU CAN TRANSMIT SOUND USING A LASER AND BRING IT ON AS PART OF A DEMONSTRATION

YOU CAN ALSO TALK ABOUT SEMICONDUCTORS CRYSTALLINE JUNCTIONS OR AMORPHOUS SOLIDS THIN-FILM SOLAR CELLS AND THEIR ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES AND HOW THEY COME ABOUT WITH JUST SOME BASIC GENERAL CHEMISTRY AND ELECTROMAGNETISM NO NEED TO GO FULLY IN DETAILS LAYMEN TERMS MAKE IT JUST AS COOL

I STUDIED BIOPHYSICS AND DID A RESEARCH PROJECT ON THE PHYSICS OF HEARING SPECIFICALLY BATS AND ECHOLOCATION SOMETHING LIKE THAT COULD BE INTERESTING AND POSSIBLY UNIQUE

YOU COULD ALSO LOOKING INTO IMAGING TECHNOLOGY LIKE CT CAT SCANS ELECTRON MICROSCOPY MRI ETC AND THE PHYSICS BEHIND THOSE

PHYSICS OF FLYING AND HOW IT APPLIES TO BIRDS IS COOL TOO
DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS AND CHAOS IS A REALLY COOL TOPIC THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR THIS YOU COULD ALSO TALK A LITTLE ABOUT HIGH DIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS AND PATTERN FORMATION
YOU COULD TALK ABOUT CAT YOU'D HAVE TO MENTION QUANTUM SUPERPOSITION AND BRIEFLY EXPLAIN WHY IT'S RELEVANT TO THE TOPIC BUT IF YOU WANT TO BE UNIQUE THAT WOULD BE A PRETTY GOOD BET SINCE I HONESTLY DOUBT MOST HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS KNOW WHAT CAT IS PLUS IT'S A PRETTY PRACTICAL ALTHOUGH PARADOXICAL CONCEPT

YOU COULD ALSO DO IT ON THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE ALTHOUGH SOME PEOPLE MIGHT GO FOR THAT AS WELL

TO UNDERSTAND ONE MUST FIRST HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE OF STRING THEORY FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS SCIENTISTS HAVE THOUGHT THAT THE SIMPLEST OBJECTS IN THE UNIVERSE ARE POINTS LIKE DOTS STRING THEORY SAYS THAT THIS IS WRONG AND THAT THE SIMPLEST OBJECTS IN THE UNIVERSE ARE SHAPED LIKE PIECES OF STRING THESE STRINGS ARE SO SMALL THAT EVEN WHEN LOOKED AT VERY CLOSELY THEY LOOK LIKE POINTS EACH BASIC PARTICLE IS CREATED BY THE STRINGS VIBRATING IN DIFFERENT PATTERNS THE REASON SCIENTISTS HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THIS IDEA FOR SO LONG IS THAT STRINGS ARE MUCH HARDER TO WORK WITH THAN POINTS THEY SEEM TO BREAK SUCH RULES AS CAUSALITY AND SPECIAL RELATIVITY WHICH SAYS THAT INFORMATION CANNOT TRAVEL FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT

STRING THEORY HAS BEEN DEVELOPED BECAUSE OF A VERY IMPORTANT PROBLEM THAT HAS EXISTED FOR ALMOST YEARS ALBERT THEORY THAT DESCRIBES THE UNIVERSE ON VERY LARGE SCALES IT IS CALLED GENERAL RELATIVITY DISAGREES WITH TWO THEORIES THAT DESCRIBE THINGS ON VERY SMALL SCALES THEY ARE CALLED QUANTUM MECHANICS AND THE STANDARD MODEL THERE ARE ALSO PROBLEMS WITH THE STANDARD MODEL IT INCLUDES ABOUT NUMBERS THAT SEEM TO HAVE NO EXPLANATION IT HAS TOO MANY BASIC PARTICLES SOME SCIENTISTS THINK IT NEEDS TO HAVE FEWER AND IT DOES NOT INCLUDE GRAVITY WHICH IS NEEDED TO EXPLAIN WEIGHT

MANY OF THESE PROBLEMS CAN BE SOLVED BY THINKING OF BASIC PARTICLES AS STRINGS NOW THERE IS ONLY ONE NUMBER WITH NO EXPLANATION WHICH GIVES THE SIZE OF THE STRINGS STRING THEORY INCLUDES PARTICLES THAT CAUSE GRAVITY CALLED GRAVITONS FINDING THIS OUT DELIGHTED THE SCIENTISTS WHO WORK ON STRING THEORY SO STRING THEORY SUCCESSFULLY BRINGS GENERAL RELATIVITY AND QUANTUM MECHANICS TOGETHER

BUT THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS WITH STRING THEORY NORMALLY WE THINK OF THE UNIVERSE AS HAVING DIMENSIONS OR BASIC DIRECTIONS OF THESE BASIC DIRECTIONS CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS UP DOWN FORWARD BACKWARD AND LEFT RIGHT THE OTHER DIRECTION IS TIME STRING THEORY NEEDS BASIC DIRECTIONS

THESE SIX OTHER DIRECTIONS CAN BE EXPLAINED IF THEY ARE CURLED UP SO THEY ARE MUCH TOO SMALL TO SEE FOR EXAMPLE BY FOLLOWING THE PATH OF A SPIRAL IT IS POSSIBLE TO GO A GREAT DISTANCE ALONG IT WITHOUT MOVING VERY FAR THE OTHER DIRECTIONS CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS TINY SPIRALS STRINGS CAN MOVE ALONG THEM A GREAT DISTANCE BUT NOT SEEM TO MOVE THIS CAN BE LOOKED AT AS A MATHEMATICAL TRICK A TRICK THAT HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH THE REAL WORLD THAT CAN BE SEEN AND TOUCHED SUCH TRICKS ARE ALLOWED IF THEY GIVE A THEORY THAT CAN BETTER TELL US HOW THINGS WORK

ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH STRING THEORY IS THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF IT EACH VERSION ALLOWS DIFFERENT KINDS OF STRINGS AND SAYS THEY WORK IN DIFFERENT WAYS STRING THEORY IS SUPPOSED TO BE A THEORY OF EVERYTHING SO THERE SHOULD BE ONLY ONE VERSION NOT SOLVES THIS PROBLEM


IN EDWARD WITTEN STARTED WHAT HAS BEEN CALLED THE SECOND SUPERSTRONG REVOLUTION BY INTRODUCING TO THE WORLD THIS THEORY COMBINES THE DIFFERENT STRING THEORIES ALONG WITH A PREVIOUSLY ABANDONED ATTEMPT TO UNIFY GENERAL RELATIVITY AND QUANTUM MECHANICS CALLED SUPERGRAVITY INTO ONE THEORY WHAT WITTEN ACTUALLY DID WAS TO PREDICT THAT THE FACT THAT ALL THESE DIFFERENT THEORIES WERE CONNECTED WAS A RESULT OF THERE BEING SOME UNDERLYING THEORY OF WHICH THEY WERE ALL APPROXIMATIONS THIS THEORY IS SOMEWHAT VAGUE IN NATURE AND HAS NOT YET BEEN PINNED DOWN

ADDITIONALLY IT WAS FOUND THAT THE EQUATIONS THAT REQUIRED STRING THEORY TO EXIST IN DIMENSIONS WERE ACTUALLY APPROXIMATIONS AS WELL THE PROPOSED WOULD NEED ONE EXTRA DIMENSION AND INSTEAD BE A THEORY THAT TAKES PLACE IN DIMENSIONS WITTEN HAS HIMSELF COMPARED THIS IDEA IN SIMPLE TERMS TO A GENERAL WHO TAKES UP A POSITION ON A HILLTOP THE EXTRA TO GET A BETTER VIEW OF THE BATTLEFIELD'S TWO OTHER DIMENSIONS

THE COMBINATION IS ACCOMPLISHED BY KNITTING TOGETHER A WEB OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN EACH OF THE STRING THEORIES CALLED DUALITIES SPECIFICALLY AND EACH OF THESE DUALITIES PROVIDES A WAY OF CONVERTING ONE OF THE STRING THEORIES INTO ANOTHER IS PROBABLY THE MOST EASILY EXPLAINED OF THE DUALITIES IT HAS TO DO WITH THE SIZE WRITTEN AS R OF THE CURLED UP DIMENSIONS OF THE STRING THEORIES IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT BY TAKING A TYPE IIA STRING THEORY THAT HAS A SIZE R AND CHANGING THE RADIUS TO R THE RESULT WILL END UP BEING WHAT IS EQUIVALENT TO A TYPE BIB THEORY OF SIZE ROYAL THIS DUALITY ALONG WITH THE OTHERS CREATES CONNECTIONS BETWEEN ALL OR IF SUPERGRAVITY IS COUNTED THEORIES THE FACT THAT THESE DUALITIES EXISTED HAD BEEN KNOWN BEFORE WITTEN CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF

ADDITIONAL AMUSEMENT HAS COME FOR MANY IN GUESSING WHAT THE M MIGHT STAND FOR POSSIBILITIES INCLUDE MATRIX MAGIC MUFFIN MYSTERY MOTHER AND MEMBRANE REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE M MIGHT POSSIBLY MEAN HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING AND ACTIVE AREAS OF RESEARCH IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS TODAY

SOURCE
I HAD DINNER WITH A PRINCETON PHD ASTROPHYSICS PROFESSOR WHO HAD WON THE EINSTEIN PRIZE AND I ASKED HIM HIS OPINION OF STRING THEORY

HE SAID I HAVE NO OPINION BECAUSE I WOULD NEED TO SPEND YEARS FULL TIME TO FAMILIARIZE MYSELF WITH THE UNDERLYING MATH AND I HAVEN'T HAD THE TIME TO DO THAT

TO GET TO WE HAVE TO START WITH STRING THEORY HERE IS THE ELI OF STRING THEORY AND

WE HAVE TWO SETS OF RULES IN OUR UNIVERSE RIGHT NOW QUANTUM MECHANICS WHICH ARE THE RULES OF THE REALLY SMALL THINGS LIKE THINGS THE SIZE OF ATOMS OR SMALLER AND GENERAL RELATIVITY WHICH ARE THE RULES FOR REALLY BIG THINGS LIKE US AND STARS THAT ARE AFFECTED BY GRAVITY

BUT WHEN YOU USE THE RULES OF GENERAL RELATIVITY IN THE WORLD OF THE REALLY SMALL CRAZY BULLSHIT HAPPENS AND WHEN YOU USE QUANTUM MECHANICS IN THE WORLD OF THE REALLY BIG SIMILAR CRAZY BULLSHIT HAPPENS

SO FOR NOW EVERYBODY HAS JUST USED QUANTUM MECHANICS TO DEAL WITH SMALL THINGS AND GENERAL RELATIVITY TO DEAL WITH THE BIG THINGS NO BIG DEAL RIGHT

EXCEPT WE DON'T LIVE IN TWO WORLDS WE LIVE IN ONE WITH BIG THINGS AND SMALL THINGS SO WHY DON'T WE HAVE ONE SET OF RULES FOR EVERYTHING

STRING THEORY IS OUR BEST ATTEMPT AT MAKING ONE SET OF RULES FOR EVERYTHING IT SEEMS TO WORK SO FAR AT COMBINING QUANTUM MECHANICS AND GENERAL RELATIVITY WITHOUT CRAZY BULLSHIT

HOW DOES IT DO THAT WELL WHEN PHYSICISTS DO THE MATH ON SOMETHING AND THE ANSWER IS INFINITY IT IS USUALLY A SIGN SOMETHING IS WRONG CRAZY BULLSHIT SINCE WE DON'T SEE INFINITY VERY OFTEN IN REAL LIFE

SO WHEN PHYSICISTS BACK IN THE DAY WERE DOING CALCULATIONS ABOUT CERTAIN COLLISIONS IT GAVE THEM A BUNCH OF INFINITIES THIS WAS BECAUSE THEY ASSUMED ALL THE FORCE IN THE COLLISIONS WAS HAPPENING AT ONE EXACT POINT IN SPACE BASICALLY A DOT WITH NO LENGTH HEIGHT OR WIDTH IF YOU PUSHED ON THE DOT WITH YOUR FINGER ALL OF THE FORCE IS ABSORBED IN THAT ONE SPOT THE DOT PUSH IT HARD ENOUGH AND YOU COULD PUSH IT INFINITELY HARD IN THEORY BUT IN THE REAL WORLD THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN

SEVERAL DECADES AGO PHYSICISTS TRIED SOMETHING ELSE INSTEAD OF THE COLLISION HAPPENING IN ONE SPOT WITH NO LENGTH HEIGHT OR WIDTH THEY TRIED TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE COLLISION WAS SPREAD OUT OVER ONE DIMENSION LET'S SAY LENGTH SO INSTEAD OF PUSHING THE DOT AND ALL THE FORCE GOING INTO THAT IT'S MORE LIKE PUSHING A STRING BENDING THE STRING AND SPREADING THE FORCE OUT FROM THE START OF THE BEND TO THE END

THAT MAY SOUND LIKE A STUPID IDEA OR ONE THAT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER THE THING IS THE SPREADING OUT OF THE ENERGY GOT RID OF THE INFINITIES

THIS WAS A BIG DEAL WHILE THESE STRINGS COULD NOT BE FOUND IN EXPERIMENTS THE MATH WORKED OVER THE YEARS THIS HAS LED TO STRING THEORY

SO WHAT ABOUT

SO THE BACK IN THE DAY PHYSICS THAT MADE INFINITIES ASSUMED PARTICLES WERE DOTS NO LENGTH HEIGHT OR WIDTH AKA DIMENSIONS SINCE IT IS A POINT WITH NO DIMENSIONS IT IS WHAT THEY CALL A BANE

STRING THEORY ASSUMED PARTICLES ARE STRINGS NO HEIGHT OR WIDTH JUST LENGTH OR WHAT THEY CALL A BANE

WHEN PHYSICISTS TOOK STRING THEORY TO IT'S LIMITS THEY FOUND COMPLETELY SELF CONSISTENT VERSIONS OF IT AT THE TIME THEY ASSUMED ONE WAS THE CORRECT ONE AND WHICH ONE WOULD BE VERIFIED BY EXPERIMENT ONE DAY

EDWARD WITTEN WHO IS SO UNBELIEVABLY SMART HE FIGURES THIS STUFF OUT IN HIS HEAD THEN WRITES THE RESULTS ON THE BACK OF A NAPKIN REALIZED THE FIVE VERSIONS OF STRING THEORY WERE PART OF THE SAME THEORY MUCH LIKE TUSKS ROUGH SKIN SMOOTH NAILS A THIN TAIL AND A FLOPPY TRUNK ARE ALL PART OF THE SAME ELEPHANT

SO WHAT EXACTLY IS THEN WELL TO TRULY UNDERSTAND IT YOU NEED ABOUT SEVEN YEARS OF STUDYING THE UNDERLYING MATHEMATICS SINCE THIS IS ELI REMEMBER HOW WE HAD BANES AND BANES WELL WHY STOP THERE WHAT ABOUT 2 BANES PARTICLES WITH LENGTH AND WIDTH BUT NO DEPTH LIKE A SHEET OF PAPER WHAT ABOUT BANES WITH LENGTH HEIGHT AND WIDTH LIKE CUBES OR SPHERES BANES BANES BANES

IS THE STUDY OF HOW THE BANES OR MEMBRANES EXCEEDINGLY CLEVER DANCE WITH ONE ANOTHER

WHY DO WE CARE ABOUT THIS BECAUSE IF PROVEN IT COULD BE THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING EXPLAINING NOT JUST WHAT WE ARE BUT WHY ON A FUNDAMENTAL MATHEMATICAL LEVEL WHY THINGS CAN'T BE DIFFERENT THAN THEY ARE NOW MUCH LIKE COUNTING CAN'T BE DIFFERENT 2 2 ETC NO MATTER HOW YOU COUNT IT

TL R IS THE STUDY OF HOW OBJECTS WITH DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS SOME WITH JUST LENGTH SOME WITH LENGTH AND WIDTH SOME WITH LENGTH WIDTH AND HEIGHT ETC INTERACT WHICH COULD EXPLAIN NOT ONLY WHAT WE ARE BUT WHY
I PROFOUNDLY DOUBT THIS COULD BE EXPLAINED TO A FIVE YEAR OLD
BELOW IS MY ATTEMPT IT OMITS MOST OF THE FUNDAMENTAL COMPLEXITIES BUT PROVIDES A SOLID FOUNDATION FOR BUILDING ON I HOPE



IS AN ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN THE MOST BASIC MAKE-UP OF HOW EVERYTHING WORKS IT IS NOT YET COMPLETE SO WE DO NOT KNOW IF IT'S THE CORRECT EXPLANATION IF IT'S SUCCESSFUL IT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY THE UNIVERSE IS AS IT IS FROM THE SMALLEST SCALE THINGS FAR TOO TINY TO SEE OR MEASURE TO THE LARGEST THINGS SO VAST WE CAN BARELY PERCEIVE THEM AT ALL SCIENTISTS VERY MUCH ARE INTERESTED IN IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN THE UNIVERSE THIS WAY BECAUSE IT MEANS THEY CAN DISCOVER AND EXPLAIN EVERYTHING SO FAR WE HAVEN'T SUCCEEDED IN THIS AND MANY THINGS REMAIN UNDISCOVERED UNKNOWN OR UNCERTAIN

PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS AT EXPLAINING THE UNIVERSE THIS WAY HAVE ALWAYS HAD PROBLEMS MOST EXPLANATIONS INVOLVE TINY PARTICLES WHICH INTERACT ACCORDING TO RULES WHICH SCIENTISTS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO PREDICT AND MEASURE PROBLEMS ARISE WHEN MEASUREMENTS CONTRADICT THE RULES AND TELL US OUR EXPLANATIONS ARE INCORRECT THERE ARE OTHER PROBLEMS AS WELL SUCH AS EXPLAINING GRAVITY WHICH CAN BE EXPLAINED WITHOUT PARTICLES AT ALL

DIFFERS IN THAT IT COMBINES MANY EXISTING EXPLANATIONS LIKE STRING THEORY TO PROPOSE THAT AT ITS SMALLEST AND MOST FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL THINGS ARE MADE UP OF PARTICLES THAT ARE VERY COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE AND DON'T BEHAVE AT ALL LIKE PARTICLES THE WAY WE THINK OF THEM THESE COMPLICATED BEHAVIORS ARE NEEDED BECAUSE IT PROVIDES A WAY TO DESCRIBE THE UNIVERSE ACCURATELY

SCIENTISTS ARE CURRENTLY WORKING HARD TO FIGURE OUT IF IS THE RIGHT EXPLANATION THEY DO SO WITH LOTS OF MATH EXPERIMENTS AND COMPARING IT AGAINST OTHER EXPLANATIONS THEY HOPE TO EITHER REACH A POINT WHERE EITHER WE CAN COMPLETE THE EXPLANATION OR PROVE THAT IT'S WRONG HOPEFULLY IN A WAY THAT POINTS US TO THE RIGHT ANSWER
I CAN DERIVE SOME BETA FUNCTIONS BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT
THE NOTION OF IS BEING DISCUSSED BY AMONG OTHERS EDWARD WITTEN A CENTRAL FIGURE IN THE SUPERSTRONG FIELD WITTEN DESCRIBES AS A CONJECTURED THEORY THAT LIES BEYOND SUPERSTRONG THEORY BUT AT THE MOMENT WE ONLY HAVE THE NAME NO CONTENTION

INTRODUCTION TO
AS I UNDERSTAND IT POORLY STRING THEORY CALLS FOR STRINGS VIBRATING IN DIMENSIONS THE FOUR NORMAL ONES AND SIX TINY CURLED UP ONES WE CAN'T SEE TO REPLACE OUR NORMAL CONCEPT OF POINT PARTICLES DIFFERENT VIBRATION PATTERNS YIELD DIFFERENT FUNDAMENTAL PARTICLES SO IF WE KNEW THE SHAPE OF THE EXTRA DIMENSIONS WE COULD CALCULATE THE MASS OF A GIVEN PARTICLE INSTEAD OF MEASURING IT NEAT THAT

ADDED AN DIMENSION AND REPLACED STRINGS WITH HIGHER DIMENSIONAL BANES OR MEMBRANES MATHEMATICALLY IT SHOWED THAT THE FIVE DIFFERENT STRING THEORIES WERE ALL RELATED IN SOME WAY

PBS CURRENTLY HAS THE VIDEO VERSIONS OF ARIANE ELEGANT UNIVERSE AVAILABLE FREE ON THEIR WEBSITE AT MINUTES EACH THIS IS PROBABLY THE CLOSEST THING TO AN ELI OF M THEORY
I THINK YOU SHOULD READ THIS BOOK TO GET A CLEAR IDEA ABOUT EVERYTHING RELATED TO STRING THEORY


GOING TO TRY FOR A LITERAL YEAR-OLD

FIRST LET'S SAY WHAT STRING THEORY DOES GO GET THE JUMP ROPE I'LL HOLD ONE END FIXED AND YOU STAND OVER THERE AND SHAKE THE OTHER END TO GET A PATTERN GOING WE'LL COUNT HOW MANY FULL WAVES WE SEE

DOES THIS AND SEES OPEN STRING MODES

SO IN STRING THEORY THIS IS WHAT IS HAPPENING AT THE VERY TINY TINY SCALE WAY SMALLER THAN AN ATOM THE STRING IS STRETCHED BETWEEN BANES THAT IS LIKE WHEN I WAS HOLDING ONE END FIXED THERE ARE CERTAIN PATTERNS THAT CAN SHOW UP AND THOSE ARE THE MODES OF THAT STRING

THOSE DIFFERENT MODES ARE TREATED LIKE DIFFERENT THINGS IN NATURE LIKE THE DIFFERENT PIECES OF ATOMS BUT EVEN SMALLER SO WE IMAGINE THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF THESE LITTLE STINGS AND BANES EVERYWHERE REPLACING ALL THOSE PARTICLES

I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH FOR TODAY

I HAD A SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHER DO THIS DEMONSTRATION OF OPEN STRING STANDING WAVES WHEN INTRODUCING QUANTUM SO CREDIT THERE
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THE TERM STRING THEORY AND HENCE M THEORY IS THAT NEITHER ARE THEORIES IN THE NORMALLY ACCEPTED SENSE FRAMEWORK WOULD BE A BETTER TERM THIS IS BEFORE GETTING INTO THE TERMINAL PROBLEMS OF THE STRING APPROACH SUCH AS THE LANDSCAPE AND LACK OF ANY CONCEIVABLE TESTABLE PREDICTION
WIKI ITS WAY ABOVE MY UNDERSTANDING OF PHYSICS BUT THIS LINK EXPLAINS IT IN ITS MOST CURRENTLY UNDERSTOOD FORM
I DO FIND IT VERY FASCINATING REGARDLESS OF COMPLEXITY

THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT CURRENTS IN A PN JUNCTION DIFFUSION CURRENT AND DRIFT CURRENT DIFFUSION CURRENT IS CAUSED BY THE DIFFERENT CONCENTRATION OF CHARGE CARRIERS ELECTRONS WILL MOVE TO THE P REGION WHILE HOLES WILL MOVE TO THE N REGION IF THE HOLES AND THE ELECTRONS COMBINE AN ION IS LEFT BEHIND POSITIVE IONS IN THE N REGION AND NEGATIVE IONS IN THE P REGION CREATING AN ELECTRIC FIELD FROM N POSITIVE TO P NEGATIVE


DRIFT CURRENT IS THE MOVEMENT OF CHARGE CARRIERS IN AN ELECTRIC FIELD IF AN ELECTRON WANTS TO MOVE FROM THE N REGION TO THE P REGION THE DRIFT CURRENT WILL TRY TO PUSH IT BACK INTO THE N REGION THE SAME GOES FOR THE HOLES THESE TWO CURRENTS WILL CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT EVENTUALLY RESULTING IN A DEPLETION ZONE


ELECTRONS AND HOLES WILL STILL MOVE AROUND BY DIFFUSION BUT UPON ENTERING THE DEPLETION ZONE THEY WILL BE PUSHED BACK BY THE ELECTRIC FIELD RESULTING IN THE DRIFT CURRENT THE CARRIERS OUTSIDE OF THE DEPLETION ZONE WILL STAY IN THEIR RESPECTIVE REGIONS AND MOVE AROUND MOST OF THE CHARGE CARRIERS WILL JUST MOVE AROUND IN RANDOM DIRECTIONS WHICH MEANS NO CURRENT ONLY THE CHARGE CARRIERS IN THE VICINITY OF THE DEPLETION REGION WILL CREATE A DIFFUSION CURRENT
ONE CONCEPT THAT I THINK ISN'T TAUGHT EARLY ENOUGH OR CLEARLY ENOUGH IN MOST TEXTBOOKS IS HOW THE FERMI LEVEL RELATES TO THE CONCENTRATION OF ELECTRONS OR HOLES THE CLOSER THE FERMI LEVEL IS TO THE CONDUCTION BAND THE HIGHER THE CONCENTRATION OF FREE ELECTRONS TO DRAW A BAND DIAGRAM IN EQUILIBRIUM YOU START BY DRAWING THE FERMI LEVEL AS A HORIZONTAL LINE BECAUSE THE FERMI LEVEL MUST BE CONSTANT IN EQUILIBRIUM THEN YOU DRAW THE CONDUCTION AND VALENCE BANDS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE JUNCTION AND CONNECT THEM WITH A CURVE

THUS IF YOU DRAW A BAND DIAGRAM FOR THE PN JUNCTION IN EQUILIBRIUM THERE IS A CONCENTRATION GRADIENT AS YOU MOVE FROM THE N-TYPE SIDE TO THE P-TYPE SIDE SINCE THE FERMI LEVEL GETS FARTHER FROM THE CONDUCTION BAND AND THIS PREDICTS A DIFFUSION CURRENT BY LAW FAR FROM THE JUNCTION IN THE QUASI-NEUTRAL REGION THERE IS NO CONCENTRATION GRADIENT SINCE THE DISTANCE OF THE FERMI LEVEL FROM THE BAND EDGES IS CONSTANT

SO I THINK A USEFUL INTERPRETATION OF THE CURRENTS CANCELLING OUT EXPLANATION IS TO IMAGINE IT AS DIFFUSION TRYING TO HAPPEN AT THE DEPLETION EDGE SINCE THE CARRIER CONCENTRATION DROPS RAPIDLY THERE BUT THIS PROCESS IS PREVENTED BY THE PRESENCE OF AN ELECTRIC FIELD
IT IS A REALLY LONG TIME SINCE I DID ANY THEORY SO I'D SUGGEST GOOGLING EAST G SEE WIKI BUT I THINK ONCE YOU HAVE EQUILIBRIUM THE DIFFUSION CURRENT WILL BE RESISTED BY THE VOLTAGE ACROSS THE JUNCTION SUCH THAT THERE IS VERY LITTLE CURRENT FLOWING ACROSS THE JUNCTION
THE ELECTRIC FIELD DEVELOPED ACROSS THE DEPLETION REGION CANCELS OUT THE DIFFUSION CURRENT YOU GOT THAT RIGHT

BUT THAT IS UNDER ZERO BIAS EQUILIBRIUM CONDITION

WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY BACKWARD CURRENT IS THE CURRENT DUE TO THE ELECTRIC FIELD IN THE SPACE CHARGE REGION DEPLETION REGION RIGHT I AM NOT GETTING YOUR QUESTION RIGHT ANYWAY TO ANSWER PARTLY THERE ARE NOT ANY FREE ELECTRONS IN THE SCR BUT THERE IS A POTENTIAL GRADIENT NO


YOU MIGHT WANT TO RESEARCH REVERSE BIAS AND FORWARD BIAS TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW A PN JUNCTION I EAST DIODE WORKS
IT'S DESCRIBING A QUANTUM WAVE INCIDENT ON A MEDIUM WHICH CAUSES SOME OF THE WAVE TO BE REFLECTED BACK AND SOME OF THE WAVE TO BE TRANSMITTED THROUGH THE MEDIUM THE EQUATION THAT ALLOWS US TO DO THESE SORTS OF CALCULATIONS FOR THE VALUES OF R AND T ARE GIVEN FROM THE SCHRODINGER EQUATION WHICH IS SHOWN AT THE TOP
THE FIGURE IS JUST FLAT OUT WRONG EVERY KINDERGARTNER KNOWS THAT QUANTUM SCATTERING LIKE THIS SHOULD BE ILLUSTRATED WITH A STEADY STREAM OF CATS BOUNCING OFF THE WALL THIS IS JUST BAD PEDAGOGY








DO I REALLY NEED THIS S
THE GREEN THING IS A WALL A BARRIER ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE WALL THE CAT WAVEFUNCTION IS THE SUPERPOSITION OF AN INCIDENT CAT BLACK AND A REFLECTED CAT WHITE ON THE LEFT RIGHT SIDE THE WAVE FUNCTION HAS JUST ONE PART A TRANSMITTED CAT GREY

THE CAT WAVEFUNCTION MUST SATISFY CERTAIN BOUNDARY CONDITIONS AT THE WALL WHICH DEPENDING ON THE EXACT NATURE OF THE WALL ALLOW YOU SOLVE FOR THE REFLECTION COEFFICIENT R AND THE TRANSMISSION COEFFICIENT T CONSERVATION OF PROBABILITY OR MATTER DEMAND R 2 T 2


I WOULD WEAR THAT ON A T-SHIRT OR A HAT
THE TOP IS THE SCHRODINGER EQUATION AND EACH CAT IS A WAVE THE INCIDENT BLACK TRANSMITTED GREY AND REFLECTED WHITE
THE ANALOGY IS OBVIOUSLY CAT THE BLACK CAT IS THE INCIDENT WAVEFUNCTION TO A CLASSICAL BARRIER I EAST AN INFINITE POTENTIAL THE WHITE CAT IS THE REFLECTED COMPONENT AND THE GREY CAT THE TRANSMITTED OR TUNNELLED COMPONENT

QUANTUM TUNNELLING IS BASICALLY TUNNELLING ANY WAVE WILL HAVE A FINITE IMAGINARY COMPONENT IN THE FORBIDDEN REGION PROVIDED THAT REGION ISN'T TOO THICK THE WAVEFUNCTION WILL REALISE A REAL COMPONENT ON THE OTHER SIDE ALBEIT OF LOWER AMPLITUDE HENCE THE CAT BEING GREY I GUESS ALTHOUGH A WAVEFUNCTION IS A PROBABILITY DENSITY SO THE CAT SHOULD BE THE SAME COLOUR BUT SORT FO STRETCHED OUT IN THE SHAPE OF WELL A AND THE PLOTTED WITH AXES AND JUST AS A LINE NOT A CAT
BASICALLY IT'S TALKING ABOUT A CAT BLACK HITTING A WALL AND GETTING BOTH REFLECTED WHITE AND TRANSMITTED GREY ACCORDING TO THE PROBABILITY GIVEN BY EQUATION UP TOP IT'S NOT A GREAT VISUALIZATION
MAN THE OF THAT DIAGRAM JUST DOESN'T HELP AT ALL WHAT A STRANGE CHOICE
IN CASE IT HELPS THIS WAS THE IMAGE USED FOR THE EXPLORING QUANTUM PHYSICS COURSE ON COURSER AN EXCELLENT COURSE IN MY OPINION
IS THERE A T-SHIRT OF THIS
I'M NOT THAT FAMILIAR WITH QUANTUM MECHANICS BUT IT APPEARS TO BE DESCRIBING A QUANTUM WAVE

DO YOU HAVE THE LINK TO THE SOURCE PLEASE
ISN'T THIS SOME SORT OF PISS TAKE SOMETHING ABOUT RECT OR OR SOME SHIT

I DO HAVE A PHYSICS DEGREE BUT THAT WAS SO LONG AGO THAT I HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL THE GOOD BITS
ENERGY IS CONSERVED IN SOME SENSE IN GR TO BE PRECISE IT IS COVARIANTLY CONSERVED THAT IS NABLA MU T MU NU WERE NABLA IS THE COVARIANT DERIVATIVE AND T MU NU IS THE STRESS ENERGY TENSOR IF WE INTRODUCE A SPACE-TIME SPLIT AND LOOK AT THE ZERO COMPONENT PARTIAL MU GAMMA SIGMA MU SIGMA T MU WE FIND THE TERM WHICH LOOKS A LOT LIKE A SOURCE TERM HOWEVER WE CAN ALWAYS FIND COORDINATES SUCH THAT THE CONNECTION AND ITS FIRST DERIVATIVE VANISH SO IN GR ENERGY IS CONSERVED LOCALLY IN FREELY FALLING COORDINATES

HOWEVER WE MAY NOT CARE ABOUT LOCALLY OR FREE FALLING IN THAT CASE WE CAN LOOK AT ASYMPTOTICALLY FLAT SPACETIME WHERE STOKES THEOREM TELLS US THAT ENERGY IS CONSERVED AT THE BOUNDARY SO AS MUCH ENERGY ENTERS A REGION OF SPACETIME AS LEAVES IN THAT CASE WE MAY BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING USEFUL IN THE REGION WHERE SPACE IS NOT FLAT LIKE REORDERING IRON ATOMS IN THAT CASE 2 KG IRON ENTER THE SPACETIME REGION 2 KG IRON LEAVE SO ENERGY IS CONSERVED THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS MAY FORBID THIS BUT TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE THE GENERALIZATION OF THE SECOND LAW TO CURVED SPACETIME INCLUDING BACKREACTION IS A UNSOLVED PROBLEM OR TO PUT IT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY ENERGY CONSERVATION DOES NOT CARE IF WE FORGE A SWORD IN THE NON-EUCLIDEAN PITS OF BUT PROBABLY WE HAVE TO SHAKE THE UNIVERSE IN THE FORM OF ENTROPY RELEASED AS GRAVITATIONAL WAVES TO SATISFY THERMODYNAMICS
HELLO STUDENT OF GENERAL RELATIVITY HERE AND I AM STILL VERY MUCH LEARNING THE SUBJECT SO I WOULD LIKE AN ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION TOO I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A COUPLE STATEMENTS ABOUT MY UNDERSTANDING OF THINGS SO ANYONE WHO IS MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE CORRECT ME

MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A DYNAMICAL SPACETIME THE ENERGY ASSOCIATED WITH A PARTICLE MOVING THROUGH THAT DYNAMICAL SPACETIME IS NOT CONSERVED

THIS WEEK I WAS LOOKING AT KILLING VECTORS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF WE HAVE A SPACETIME WITH A KILLING VECTOR ASSOCIATED WITH THE TIME COMPONENT OF THE METRIC WE CAN USE THEOREM TO DEFINE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY IN THAT SYSTEM DO I HAVE THAT RIGHT

IF I DO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A DYNAMICAL SPACETIME DOES THIS IMPLY THAT THERE ARE NO KILLING FIELDS PRESENT MEANING THAT THERE IS NO ISOMETRY MEANING THAT THERE IS NO CONSERVATION OF ANYTHING ENERGY OR MOMENTUM

ANY CLARIFICATION WOULD BE GREAT THANKS
HOW DISAPPOINTING
DOESN'T DARK MATTER SIMPLY STAND FOR A VARIABLE IN CERTAIN EQUATIONS THAT REPRESENTS SOMETHING WE CAN'T DETECT MEASURE TO ME IT WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE TO REWORK THESE EQUATIONS FROM EXISTING AND KNOWN PARTICLES FORCES RATHER THAN RELY ON A PHANTOM ELEMENT DARK MATTER TO SUPPORT THE EQUATIONS
HERE'S A GREAT FREE OPTICS TEXTBOOK I USED IT IN MY INTRO TO OPTICS COURSE I RECOMMEND HAVING GONE THROUGH AT LEAST HALF OF GRIFFITHS BEFORE STARTING IT THOUGH

LOOKING FOR A GOOD INTRODUCTION TO LINEAR RESPONSE THEORY AT ABOUT A GRADUATE LEVEL PREFERABLY WITH A FOCUS ON APPLICATIONS IN QUANTUM AND CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS ANYONE GOT ANY SUGGESTIONS RECOMMENDATIONS
HAS ANYONE USED QUANTUM MECHANICS BY AULETTA ET AL AND KNOW WHERE I COULD GET IT ON THE CHEAP I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE IT ASSIGNED FOR OUR GRADUATE LEVEL QM COURSE WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING A BIT MORE STANDARD
HELLO GUYS PLEASE RECOMMEND ME A QUANTUM FIELD THEORY BOOK I FIND PESKIN SCHROEDER TOO HARD FOR ME AT THE CURRENT MOMENT THANK YOU
HELLO CAN ANYONE RECOMMEND ME A GOOD SOLID STATE TEXTBOOK
I'M STARTING TO WORK MY WAY THROUGH GRAVITATION ARE THERE ANY ESPECIALLY GOOD LECTURE SERIES TO COMPLEMENT IT
I WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE DIRAC FIELD BETTER THAN I DO PESKIN AND SCHRODER AND NOTES DID AN ALRIGHT JOB OF GETTING ME TO TURN THE CRANK BUT I REALLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO ROK IT DOES ANYONE KNOW OF A GOOD TEXT THAT INTRODUCES THE DIRAC FIELD AND SPINORS ALONGSIDE THE REQUISITE REPRESENTATION THEORY AND GEOMETRY TO REALLY UNDERSTAND IT

I'VE HAD SOME DIFFERENTIAL TOPOLOGY SO I'M COMFORTABLE WITH LIE GROUP AND LIE ALGEBRAS BUNDLES AND THE LIKE I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE THAN PESKIN AND SCHROEDER FOR INSTANCE
I'M LOOKING FOR A PHYSICS BOOK TO PICK UP COMPLETE BEGINNER TO PHYSICS I KNOW VIRTUALLY NOTHING I'M VERY COMFORTABLE WITH SINGLE VARIABLE CALCULUS THOUGH SO THE MATH WON'T BE THE BOTTLENECK I'M IN A BASIC PHYSICAL SCIENCE COURSE IN COLLEGE AND IT'S MORE CHALLENGING THAN I EXPECTED
IN THE ABSENCE OF NET EXTERNAL FORCES THE CENTRE OF MASS MOVES WITH CONSTANT VELOCITY SO THAT THE CENTRE OF MASS FRAME IS A VERY CONVENIENT FRAME BECAUSE IT'S INERTIAL THEN IN THE COM FRAME THE BODY CAN ONLY ROTATE ABOUT THE COM BECAUSE THE ROTATION ABOUT ANY OTHER POINT WOULD MEAN THE COM MOVES

INCLUDING INERTIAL FORCES
ROTATIONAL NOT AROUND THE CENTER OF MASS REQUIRES AN EXTERNAL FORCE ALSO SEPARATION OF VARIABLES ALLOWS ONE TO DEAL WITH TRANSLATION AND ROTATION S INDEPENDENTLY

IF YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE SOME PUMPING CAPACITY YOU COULD JUST STICK A GRID OR SOMETHING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TUBE
I ONCE HEARD THAT PAUL GOT THE IDEA FOR THIS WHEN HE WAS CARRYING A HARD BOILED EGG UP THE STAIRS ON A TRAY FOR HIS WIFE AND REALIZED HE COULD GET THE EGG TO BALANCE BETTER IF HE JOSTLED THE TRAY PERIODICALLY MIGHT HAVE BEEN PENNING THOUGH
HAHA JUST READ ABOUT PAUL TRAP IN THE CONNECTION OF ION TRAP QUANTUM COMPUTERS HELPED ABIT FOR THE UNDERSTANDING BECAUSE IT WAS ABIT UNCLEAR WHY I NEED THE RF FOR IT BUT I UNDERSTAND IT NOW

ITS ALWAYS INTERESTING HOW PHYSICISTS IN THE PAST GAINED IDEAS TO SOLVE THINGS LIKE THAT
THAT'S HOW THE PARTICLES IN THE TRAP GET THEIR SPIN S SCR
THIS WAS A GREAT DEMONSTRATION REALLY ENJOYED IT
I WENT FOR AN INTERVIEW WITH A COMPANY MAKING QUANTUM COMPUTERS THEY TRAP THE ENTANGLED CHARGED PARTICLES IN THIS WAY AND MOVE THEM AROUND THE CPU LIKE THIS

THEY BRIEFLY EXPLAINED THEIR PAUL TRAP TO WHICH I REPLIED

ME AH YEAH YOU CAN'T COMB YOUR HAIRY BALLS

INTERVIEWER WHAT

ME HAIRY BALLS SIR YOU CAN'T COMB THEM FLAT IMAGINE HAVING A HAIRY BALL AND TRYING TO COMB IT SO THAT ALL THE HAIR LIES FLAT YOU CAN'T DO IT YOU'D ALWAYS END UP WITH A SPIKE OF HAIR SOMEWHERE THAT'S WHY YOU NEED TO KEEP SHIFTING THE HAIR ABOUT TO KEEP THE EXCESS HAIR MOVING ABOUT

I DIDN'T GET A SECOND INTERVIEW

IT'S A REAL THING BUT THEY'D NEVER HEARD OF IT
I VR MAY BE THE MOST FAMILIAR FORM OF OHM S LAW BUT IT IS FAR FROM THE ONLY ONE

I CERTAINLY HOPE IT'S NOT THE MOST FAMILIAR

ON A MORE SERIOUS NOTE LAW IS A LAW FOR OHMIC DEVICES AND IT'S VERY USEFUL WIRES ARE OHMIC THE IDEAL GAS LAW DOESN'T APPLY FOR REAL GASES IS THE IDEAL GAS LAW THEN NOT A LAW
THERE ARE MANY SIMILAR EXAMPLES BUT ONE SHOULDN'T SUGGEST THAT A LAW IS MISNAMED WHEN OBSERVATIONS DEFY IT TAKE THE IDEAL GAS LAW

WPS MEDIA OBJECTS

THE PURPOSE OF A LAW IS TO GENERALIZE OBSERVATIONS THAT HAPPEN UNDER SOME CONDITIONS BUT IT NEED NOT PROVIDE GUARANTEES ABOUT IT'S OWN ACCURACY IT'S EVEN DIFFICULT TO FIND ANY LAW THAT HOLDS WELL UNDER A WIDE RANGE OF CONDITIONS EDIT VALENAUT BEAT ME TO IT
YOU COULD WRITE A FOLLOWUP ARTICLE ON LAW
COUGH COUGH
GUIDELINE AVUNCULAR ADVICE IRRESISTIBLE ANECDOTE

I HAPPEN TO AGREE THAT THE TERM LAW IS MISLEADING IN A SCIENTIFIC CONTEXT BUT THEN THERE'S THE PROBLEM OF COMING UP WITH AN ALTERNATE EXPRESSION
IT DANG WELL BETTER BE A LAW IT'S TATTOOED ON MY INNER LOWER LIP
NATURE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT AND SHE BEHAVES THE WAY SHE IS GOING TO BEHAVE WHETHER YOU BOTHER TO TAKE DOWN THE DATA OR NOT

THIS ONE FROM WIKIPEDIA OBSERVER EFFECT
MAYBE WATCH HIS LECTURE ON MATHEMATICS VS PHYSICS THERE MAYBE SOMETHING IN THERE
WATCH V OBCJODEOLVW

ALSO POSSIBLY THE MESSENGER LECTURES ON GRAVITATION COULD BE OF SOME HELP
IN CASE YOU CAN'T ACCESS THE FULL PAPER THE PDF IS ALSO HOSTED HERE

IN THIS PAPER RESEARCHERS ARE DESCRIBING A NEWISH TYPE OF SOLAR CELL THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IS SHOWING REASONABLY HIGH EFFICIENCIES MOST CONVENTIONAL SOLAR CELLS OPERATE ON WHAT IS CALLED THE PHOTOVOLTAIC EFFECT THE BASIC IDEA IS SHOWN IN THIS DIAGRAM THE SIMPLEST CELL WILL BE MADE UP OF A SEMICONDUCTING MATERIAL WITH A GIVEN BANDGAP LIGHT CAN THEN COME IN AND EXCITE AN ELECTRON FROM THE VALENCE BAND INTO THE CONDUCTION BAND LEAVING A HOLE BEHIND TO A GOOD APPROXIMATION YOU CAN ASSUME THAT MOST PHOTONS WITH AN ENERGY HIGHER THAN THE BAND GAP WILL BE ABSORBED BUT ALL PHOTONS WITH A SMALLER ENERGY WILL BE LOST THE CELL IS THEN HOOKED UP TWO AN EXTERNAL CIRCUIT SO THAT THE ELECTRON CAN GO ONE WAY THE HOLE THE OTHER WAY CREATING A CURRENT WHICH CAN THEN DO USEFUL WORK

OF COURSE FOR ANY SOLAR CELL WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO MAXIMIZE IS THE POWER YOU CAN GET OUT GIVEN BY THE CURRENT X VOLTAGE I EAST IV IN CONVENTIONAL SOLAR CELLS THE CURRENT IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE NUMBER OF PHOTONS ABSORBED ON THE OTHER HAND THE VOLTAGE WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE BANDGAP HIGHER BANDGAP HIGHER V SO NOW THERE IS A TRADEOFF YOU WANT THE BANDGAP TO BE AS SMALL AS POSSIBLE SO YOU CAN COLLECTED AS MUCH LIGHT AS POSSIBLE BUT YOU ALSO WANT THE BANDGAP TO BE HIGH SO THE VOLTAGE CAN BE HIGH THE MAXIMUM POWER CONVERSION EFFICIENCY ENERGY GENERATED PER INPUT OF SOLAR ENERGY AS DETERMINED BY SHOCKLEY QUEISSER LOOKS LIKE THIS THERE IS A SWEET SPOT AROUND WHERE YOU CAN GET THE MOST POWER OUT MOST HIGH PERFORMANCE SOLAR CELLS EAST G SILICON CELLS FALL IN THAT RANGE

NOW IN THIS WORK RESEARCHERS USED A MATERIAL CALLED BARIUM TITANATE AS THE ACTIVE MATERIAL BARIUM TITANATE LOOKS LIKE A WHITE POWDER WHICH SUGGESTS THAT IT WOULD BE AWFUL FOR PV APPLICATIONS HOWEVER IN THIS STUDY RESEARCHERS GOT A POWER CONVERSION EFFICIENCY OF CLOSE TO AS THE LEAD RESEARCHER DESCRIBES IT
BARIUM TITANATE ABSORBS LESS THAN A TENTH OF THE SPECTRUM OF THE SUN BUT OUR DEVICE CONVERTS INCIDENT POWER PERCENT MORE EFFICIENTLY THAN THE THEORETICAL LIMIT FOR A CONVENTIONAL SOLAR CELL CONSTRUCTED USING THIS MATERIAL OR A MATERIAL OF THE SAME ENERGY GAP

IN OTHER WORDS AS PER THE TITLE OF THE PAPER THEY BEAT THE SHOCKLEY QUEISSER FOR BARIUM TITANATE BY QUITE A BIT THE REASON THIS WAS POSSIBLE IS THAT THESE CELLS OPERATE BASED ON THE ANOMALOUS PV EFFECT THAT EFFECT IS STILL NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD BUT IT RELIES ON A MATERIAL HAVING A CRYSTAL STRUCTURE WITHOUT A CENTER OF SYMMETRY EAST G A FERROELECTRIC MATERIAL IN THESE MATERIALS THE VOLTAGE UNDER APPLIED LIGHT CAN BE MUCH HIGHER THAN THE BANDGAP OF THE MATERIAL THE DOWNSIDE IS THAT THE CURRENT IS USUALLY VERY LOW IN THIS PARTICULAR STUDY BOTH THE VOLTAGE AND CURRENT WERE SUFFICIENTLY HIGH FOR THE FIRST TIME TO REALLY SHOW RESPECTABLE PERFORMANCE

TL R A NEWISH TYPE OF SOLAR CELL SHOWS MUCH HIGHER PERFORMANCE THAN SIMILAR CELLS IN THE PAST AND MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT CAN BE PREDICTED USING THE CONVENTIONAL PHOTOVOLTAIC EFFECT IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL HOW FAR THIS TECHNOLOGY CAN GO BUT THE RESULT IS PRETTY COOL NONETHELESS
THE ONLY WAY I CAN THINK OF TO BEAT WOULD BE FOR A CARRIER HIGH UP IN THE BAND FROM A PHOTON WITH ENERGY ECAP TO KICK MORE CARRIERS ACROSS THE GAP THIS WAY WOULD GET BACK SOME OF THE ENERGY OTHERWISE LOST TO HEAT IN A SINGLE JUNCTION CELL

THEY GET SOME KIND OF CHARGE SEPARATION THAT SETS UP A FIELD MAYBE THE DISTANCE THE CARRIERS TRAVEL BEFORE THEY THERMALIZE IS DEPENDENT ON THEIR EXCESS ENERGY AND THIS IS A WAY TO GET SOME OF THAT BACK

THE PHOTOCURRENT SPECTRUM IS VERY VERY NARROW AND NOT WELL-MATCHED TO SUNLIGHT AT ALL TOTAL EFFICIENCIES NEED TO BE CALCULATED WITH A SOLAR SPECTRUM THIS IS WHY A JUNCTION WITH OPTIMUM BANDGAP CAN ONLY EVER BE FOR A LASER RIGHT ABOVE THE BANDGAP THE QUANTUM EFFICIENCY WOULD BE CLOSE TO FOR ANY GOOD SEMICONDUCTOR SOLAR CELL


THE SIMPLE ANSWER IS THAT IT TAKES MORE FORCE TO BREACH THE SIDES OF THE BARREL THAN IT DOES TO PUSH THE WATER OUT OF THE WAY SOME GUNS WILL EXPLODE IF SHOT WITH A BARREL FULL OF WATER THOUGH A GAUGE SHOTGUN WITH A SLUG ROUND SHOT UNDERWATER COULD POSSIBLY EXPLODE FOR EXAMPLE
AWWWW YEEEEEEAA
HEY I WAS WONDERING WHY WE HEAR SOME SOUNDS OF AN EVENT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY

YOU SHOULD REALIZE THAT THAT VIDEO HAS ARTIFICIALLY SYNCHRONIZED SOUND AND PICTURE THE ORIGINAL RECORDING HAS A LONG DELAY BETWEEN PICTURE AND SOUND DUE TO THE DISTANCE TO THE CAMERA

HOWEVER THE BIG BANG OCCURS A FEW SECONDS LATER WHY

THE FIRST EXPLOSION IS IN THE UPPER STAGE WHICH HAS LIMITED FUEL AND OXIDIZER TO SUPPORT A LARGE EXPLOSION THE SECOND EXPLOSION TAKES PLACE IN THE LOWER STAGE WHICH HAS MUCH MORE FUEL AND OXIDIZER AVAILABLE
THE POP MAY HAVE BEEN THE INITIATING EVENT IF IT OCURRED A FEW SECONDS BEFORE THE MAIN EXPLOSION THE SOUND OF IT MIGHT HAVE ARRIVED AT THE CAMERA SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE FLASH FROM THE MAIN EXPLOSION THE BANG FROM THE MAIN EXPLOSION THEN ARRIVED AT THE CAMERA A FEW SECONDS LATER YET

IN MY OPINION THE BEST WAY TO CHANGE THE PERCEPTION AND MISUSE OF PHYSICS IS TO BECOME AN EDUCATOR OR A SCIENTIFIC POPULARIZER BUT THIS RARELY WORKS UNFORTUNATELY IF YOU ARE AN EDUCATOR THEN YOU WILL MOST LIKELY BE TEACHING SCIENTIFICALLY LITERATE PEOPLE A NOTABLE MINORITY WHILE A SCIENTIFIC POPULARIZER IS MUCH MORE INFLUENTIAL BECOMING ONE IS PRETTY IMPROBABLE

AN EFFECTIVE METHOD WOULD BE TO HIT THESE GROUPS SPECIFICALLY THE DAILY MAIL WHERE IT HURTS THEIR WALLET SPREADING AND SHARING THESE LINKS YOU ARE AIDING THE PROPAGATION ALTHOUGH I KNOW YOU DON'T MEAN TO OF THE VERY PROBLEMS YOU WISH TO AVOID MOST OF THE TIME THE BEST WAY TO GET RID OF SOMETHING IS TO PATIENTLY IGNORE IT BECAUSE DRAWING ATTENTION TO IT ONLY ATTRACTS THE CRACKPOTS AS OUTPERFORMS PUT IT

AS FOR YOUR CAREER BECOMING AN EDUCATOR THAT INVOLVES IN OUTREACH AND IS MINDFUL OF THE DANGERS OF PROPAGATING POOR SCIENCE IS AN OPTION AND IN MY OPINION ITS THE MOST EFFECTIVE ONE

SORRY TO BE SUCH A DOWNER HOPE THIS HELPS
SCHOOL GENERALLY DOESN'T PRESENT COMPETING MINORITY VIEWS IN SCIENCE AND TENDS TO TEACH AS THOUGH A CERTAIN WAY OF THINKING IS A DONE DEAL

HOPEFULLY YOU'RE BETTER THAN THAT CONTROVERSIES ARE GOOD FOR SCIENCE EVEN IF YOU THINK OTHERWISE IN THIS CASE QM IS NOT A DONE DEAL AND THERE IS DEFINITELY A LOT OF AMBIGUITY THAT IS GETTING DUSTED UNDER THE CARPET IN EVERY CONVENTIONAL THEORY THERE ARE GAPS AND WEAKNESSES THAT NEED TO ADDRESSED THAT OFTEN AREN'T CONTROVERSIES FORCE THE ISSUE BECAUSE PEOPLE WITH COMPETING THEORIES WON'T LET YOU GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING YOU EITHER GET DOWN INTO THE WEEDS WITH THEM OR CONCEDE DEFEAT BY BURYING THEIR VIEWPOINT

EVEN BIBLICAL CREATIONIST CAN BE HELPFUL IN THIS PROCESS BY EXPOSING THE SOFT UNDERBELLY OF EVOLUTIONARY THEORY AND EXPLOITING ITS WEAKNESSES THEY ARE ALWAYS QUESTIONING THE VALIDITY OF EVIDENCE THIS IS A GOOD THING IT HELPS PREVENT GROUP THINK AND FORCES SCIENTISTS TO CONFRONT ISSUES THEY'D RATHER IGNORE THE FIGHTS IN THESE AREAS OF SCIENCE STRENGTHEN THE SCIENCE OVERALL

THE VERY BEST THING YOU CAN DO IS LET IT PLAY OUT
DON'T LET THE LEAVE IT ALONE AND YOU CAN'T CHANGE MINDS CROWDS DISCOURAGE YOU LOOK AT VIDEO BLOGGERS LIKE VERITASIUM SMARTER EVERY DAY AND SCI SHOW JUST TO NAME THREE THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD WHO HAVE DEDICATED THEMSELVES TO SCIENCE EDUCATION AND I SUSPECT THEIR REACH AND IMPACT IS SUBTLE BUT HUGE THE TYSONS AND LAGANS AND KRAUSSES OF THE WORLD ARE AWESOME TOO HEROES TO ME AND THEY SPEAK FROM A PLACE OF REAL SCIENCE AUTHORITY TM BUT REALIZE THAT MAKING STUFF CLEAR DOESN'T REQUIRE KNOWING EVERYTHING SO MUCH AS IT REQUIRES KNOWING HOW TO REACH OUT AND EXPLAIN THINGS IN VIVID IMAGES AND COMPELLING METAPHORS THAT SERVE AS INTUITION PUMPS H T TO DANIEL DENNETT TAKE SCIENCE CLASSES VIDEO CLASSES AND ABOVE ALL WRITING CLASSES THAT'S MY TWO CENTS DISCLAIMER FORMER PHYSICS MAJOR HERE
NOT EVEN CLASSES IN QM BUT JUST BASIC SCIENTIFIC REASONING SKILLS SO THAT PEOPLE CAN SPOT THIS KIND OF THING

THAT'S EVEN MORE AMBITIOUS AND MORE WORTHWHILE THAN THE FIRST GOAL YOU STATED TEACHING CRITICAL THINKING THE ROLE OF THE NULL HYPOTHESIS SKEPTICISM AND OTHER PROPERTIES OF SCIENTIFIC THINKING WOULD PRODUCE A MASSIVE AND BENEFICIAL CHANGE IN SOCIETY SO MASSIVE THAT MANY GROUPS WITH POLITICAL POWER WOULD OBJECT AND RESIST THOSE WOULD BE THE SAME GROUPS WHO ARE ALREADY OBJECTING TO THE HERETICAL IDEA OF TEACHING EVOLUTION IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

WHAT KIND OF CAREER SHOULD I BE LOOKING INTO TEACHING OUTREACH PERHAPS AT A MUSEUM OR DOING TALKS AT SCHOOLS OR THROUGH STARTING MY OWN BUSINESS

TO ME THE MOST INFLUENTIAL SPOKESPEOPLE FOR A RATIONAL OUTLOOK HAPPEN TO FALL BY CHANCE INTO THAT ROLE NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON CARL SAGAN MENTOR WHEN HE WAS A TEENAGER LAWRENCE KRAUSS AND OTHERS HAVE PUBLIC RESPECT AND A KIND OF AUTHORITY THAT ALTHOUGH CONTRARY TO A SCIENTIFIC OUTLOOK IMPROVES THEIR CHANCE TO BE HEARD

MY POINT IS THIS IS NOT SOMETHING ONE CAN SIGN UP FOR IT'S MORE CIRCUMSTANTIAL AND PROBABILISTIC BUT THIS SHOULDN'T DISCOURAGE YOU FROM SPEAKING OUT IN ANY VENUE THAT PRESENTS ITSELF AND TRAINING YOURSELF IN CRITICAL THINKING FOR PURELY PERSONAL REASONS
THE ARTICLE YOU POSTED WITH VIEWS IS MOST DEFINITELY NOT MISUSING ANYTHING IT REPORTS ON A REALIZATION OF WHEELERS DELAYED CHOICE EXPERIMENT WHICH PROVES THAT A PARTICLE CAN HAVE NO OBJECTIVE EXISTENCE BEFORE IT IS MEASURED UNLESS YOU ACCEPT SOME CRACKPOT THEORY LIKE PILOT WAVE PHYSICAL THINGS ARE MOVING FASTER THAN LIGHT IN DISCONTINUOUS TRAJECTORIES OR EVEN BACK IN TIME OR OWI THE WAVEFUNCTION ABSTRACT MATH IS MAGICALLY REAL OR PHYSICAL THE PROFESSOR WHO RAN THE EXPERIMENT STATED THAT REALITY DOES NOT EXIST UNTIL IT IS MEASURED EVEN PILOT WAVE IS RULED AS IMPLAUSIBLE BY RECENT EXPERIMENT UNLESS YOU BELIEVE PHYSICAL THINGS CAN TRAVEL FASTER THAN LIGHT

IT ISN'T SO MUCH THAT THINGS ARE BEING MISUSED BY OTHERS BUT THAT YOUR WORLD-VIEW IS BEING PROVEN LESS AND LESS TENABLE AS TIME GOES ON
THIS REMINDS ME OF HOW FIBER OPTIC CABLES HAVE A REFRACTIVE INDEX THAT IS A FUNCTION OF RADIUS I THINK AT A FIXED RADIUS IT CHANGES DISCONTINUOUSLY ENOUGH TO CAUSE A REFLECTION SO THAT AS LITTLE LIGHT LEAVES THROUGH THE SIDES AS POSSIBLE
I JUST WANT TO SAY HOW MUCH I LOVE YOUR BLACK BOARD
THAT TITLE ALONE IS GIVING ME ANXIETY FUCK LENSES
READING MAKES ME SAD COULD YOU GO INTO WHAT SPECIFICALLY MAKES THESE LENSES IMPOSSIBLE IS IT THE MAX INDEX IF SO WHAT WOULD EACH LENS LOOK LIKE AS IT APPROACHED THE THEORETICAL MAXIMUM
IF YOU MEAN GLASS IN THE AMORPHOUS SILICON DIOXIDE SENSE THEN I CAN'T HELP YOU BUT I CAN SHARE THE FIRST THING I THOUGHT OF APPROACHING THEORETICAL STRENGTH IN GLASSY CARBON NANOLATTICES SORRY THAT THIS IS PROBABLY NOT WHAT YOU WANT BUT GLASSY CARBON IS JUST SO COOL
I HOPE THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE TO ASK THIS THIS QUESTION IS MORE GEARED FOR THEORETICAL PHYSICISTS BUT REALLY ANYONE CAN ANSWER I'M JUST LOOKING FOR A VARIETY OF METHODS

I AM JUST STARTING RESEARCH INTO THEORETICAL COSMOLOGY I'M A SECOND YEAR GRAD STUDENT MY MAIN QUESTION IS HOW OTHER PEOPLE GO ABOUT READING AND UNDERSTANDING PAPERS RIGHT NOW MY METHOD IS TO READ IT ONCE THEN GO THROUGH IT IN DETAIL I EAST TRYING TO CONFIRM EQUATIONS LOOKING FOR IMPORTANT CLAIMS ETC HOWEVER I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'M REALLY GETTING MUCH FROM THIS I'LL FINISH MY NOTES AND THIRD READ THROUGH BUT I STILL WON'T FEEL LIKE I'M UNDERSTANDING THE POINT OF THE PAPER ANY IDEAS

WOULD IT BE BETTER TO GO TO A COLLEGE FOR UNDERGRAD THEN TRANSFER FOR WORK OR ATTEND A COLLEGE THAT OFFERS HIGHER DEGREES THEMSELVES

EDIT OKAY THANK YOU
I JUST STARTED MY FIRST YEAR IN ELECTRICAL AND COMMUNICATION ENGINEERING AND ALL MY PROFESSORS KEEP SAYING THE SAME THING I E TO KEEP UP TO DATE WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING IN MY FIELD HIS DO I ACTUALLY DO THAT ALSO WHAT STUFF SHOULD I READ UP OUTSIDE MY UNIVERSITY COURSE

APPLYING TO GRAD SCHOOL RIGHT NOW AND DECIDING BETWEEN COMPUTATIONAL VS EXPERIMENTAL

BASICALLY SHOULD YOU ENJOY DOING DAY-TO-DAY EXPERIMENTAL STUFF TO GO INTO EXPERIMENTAL I TOOK A LABORATORY ELECTRONICS COURSE THAT I DID WELL IN BUT DIDN'T REALLY GET EXCITED ABOUT I DID RESEARCH IN AN OPTICS LAB AND THE EXPERIMENTAL PORTION OF IT WAS PRETTY MISERABLE DIDN'T HAVE CLEAR DIRECTION MY EXPERIMENTS DIDN'T WORK ALIGNING OPTICS IS NOT FUN AND SITTING ALONE IN A DARK ROOM IS NOT FUN

IN CONTRAST I ENJOY CODING AND HAVE ENJOYED THE COMPUTATIONAL PROJECTS I'M ON BUT I WANT TO GO INTO INDUSTRY AFTER A PHD AND ALWAYS HEAR THAT EXPERIMENTALISTS ARE IN MUCH HIGHER DEMAND THAN THEORISTS OR COMPUTATIONALISTS I'M ALSO CONFLICTED BECAUSE I REALLY ONE OF MY CURRENT PROJECTS WHICH IS DOING COMPUTATIONAL DESIGN OF DEVICES I DON'T THINK IT'S A PROJECT A COMPUTATIONAL GROUP WOULD WORK ON BUT IF I JOINED AN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP I WOULD IMAGINE I'D HAVE TO DO THE EXPERIMENTAL PORTION AS WELL IN HINDSIGHT THIS FEELS DUMB TO TYPE OUT BUT I'M CURIOUS IF EXPERIMENT IS SOMETHING PEOPLE PUT UP WITH OR ENJOY

HAS ANYONE HERE MANAGED TO SKIP MSC TO ENTER PHD IN EUROPE THERE'S AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN MY THE COLLEGES OF MY COUNTRY CHILE AND GERMANY THAT ALLOWS THIS BUT IM LOOKING FOR PRACTICAL CASES SINCE I AM IN MY LAST UNDERGRAD SEMESTER AND MY ADVISOR ALWAYS TELLS ME THAT DOING A MSC IS A WASTE OF TIME

FOR EUROPEANS WHO APPLIED TO US GRAD SCHOOLS HOW DID YOU KNOW WHICH UNIVERSITIES TO CHOOSE BY THAT I MEAN HOW DID YOU KNOW HOW GOOD YOUR APPLICATION WAS AND WHAT SCHOOLS YOU COULD REALISTICALLY GET INTO

I HAVE JUST GRADUATED FROM A YEAR UNDERGRAD IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS FROM A SCHOOL TYPICALLY RANKED ON THOSE UNIVERSITY RANKING SITES WITH A FIRST CLASS HON DEGREE OVERALL REALLY HIGH SCORES IN AFT STANDARD MODEL AND COMPUTATION COURSES BUT LOWER SCORES IN CONDENSED MATTER STUFF AND SOME PURE MATHS

I HAVE HAD 2 SUMMER INTERNSHIPS FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS BOTH IN LATTICE CD THE FIRST WAS IN MY UNIVERSITY AND THE SECOND ONE WAS A FAIRLY PRESTIGIOUS APC INTERNSHIP IN EUROPE UNDER UNDER A WELL KNOWN PROFESSOR IN THE FIELD I WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL WHICH HAS LATTICE CD BUT I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT SCHOOLS I COULD APPLY TO OR WHERE TO EVEN START LOOKING

I WILL BE SITTING THE GRE ON THE AND I AM ONLY STARTING TO STUDY PROPERLY NOW I HAVE DONE TWO PRACTICE TESTS OVER THE LAST 2 MONTHS BUT NOT SERIOUSLY AND DIDN'T FIND THEM TOO DIFFICULT BUT MY OPTICS AND ELECTRONIC KNOWLEDGE IS PRETTY AWFUL

WILL MY APPLICATION BE COMPLETELY DEPENDENT ON THIS SCORE AND WILL I BE ABLE TO WAIT FOR THE SCORE BEFORE I PICK THE SCHOOLS

IF ANYONE NA OR EU HAS ANY ADVICE ON WHAT SCHOOLS I SHOULD LOOK AT WHAT SCORES I NEED IN THE GRE TIPS FOR THE GRE OR ANYTHING YOU THINK USEFUL IT WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED
I AM THINKING ABOUT GOING FOR A PH D IN PLASMA PHYSICS TO GET INTO FUSION RESEARCH BUT I DID NOT GET ANY EXPERIENCE IN THE SUBJECT AS AN UNDERGRAD WILL THIS AFFECT MY ABILITY TO PURSUE THIS IN GRAD SCHOOL

ALSO I HAD A WEIRD UNDERGRAD CURRICULUM AND THERE IS A CHANCE THE I COULD BE REQUIRED TO TAKE MORE UNDERGRAD CLASSES WHEN I GET ACCEPTED TO A SCHOOL COULD ANYONE GIVE ME INSIGHT INTO HOW THAT WOULD WORK
WHAT FACTORS SHOULD I CONSIDER WHEN CHOOSING A TOPIC FOR MY MASTER'S THESIS I HAD A GREAT TIME DOING MY BACHELOR'S THESIS AND I HAVE TALKED TO MY BACHELOR SUPERVISOR ABOUT POSSIBLE MASTER'S TOPICS AND NARROWED IT DOWN TO TWO

ONE WOULD BE A VERY INTERESTING THEORETICAL TOPIC CONTINUING MY BACHELOR RESEARCH BUT I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO EXPERIMENTAL DATA TO ACTUALLY COMPARE THE THEORY TO THIS TOPIC WOULD ALSO BE IN LINE WITH MOST OF THE LECTURES I LISTENED TO IN MY MASTER'S PROGRAM

THE OTHER ONE WOULD BE THEORETICAL WORK OUTSIDE OF WHAT I HAVE LEARNED ABOUT SO FAR I HAD ONE RELATED LECTURE BUT IT IS IN COLLABORATION WITH ANOTHER LARGE INTERDISCIPLINARY INSTITUTE AND I COULD DO LAB WORK TO DIRECTLY CHECK MY RESULTS

I WILL WORK ON THE THESIS FOR A YEAR AND WILL START NEXT YEAR SO I DO HAVE TIME TO GET INTO A MORE UNKNOWN TOPIC

WHAT WERE THE DECIDING FACTOR WHEN YOU CHOSE YOUR THESIS TOPICS I'M REALLY STUCK AND NEED SOME NEW IDEAS TO HELP ME DECIDE
SO I'M LOOKING FOR SOME GENERAL ADVICE AS TO WHAT ELSE I CAN DO TO DISTINGUISH MYSELF FROM MY PEERS AS I KNOW THAT ADMISSIONS INTO THE TOP PHD PROGRAMS AND BEYOND ARE EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE

MY CURRENT SITUATION IS

SECOND YEAR OF A BSC AUSTRALIAN DEGREE WITH MAJORS IN PHYSICS AND APPLIED MATHS AND A GOOD GA

I HAVE SUGGESTED TO SOME OF THE STAFF TO TAKE SOME TUTORIAL TYPE CLASSES FOR FIRST YEARS AND THEY'RE LOOKING INTO IT NOW FOR NEXT YEAR

I'VE ALREADY DONE ONE RESEARCH PROJECT WITH A PAPER CURRENTLY IN PREPARATION AND HAVE APPLIED FOR SOME MORE PROJECTS BOTH AROUND AUSTRALIA AND AT MY OWN UNIVERSITY TO DO THIS YEAR

I'M CURRENTLY HEADING TOWARDS ASTRONOMY BUT THAT IS ONLY BECAUSE OF SAID PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE NOT REALLY AN EXPLICIT CHOICE AS MY UNIVERSITY ONLY REALLY HAS ASTROPHYSICISTS NOT EVEN A SINGLE THEORETICAL ONE

I'M NOT SURE WHAT ELSE THERE IS THAT I CAN DO RIGHT NOW AND WHILST CLASSES ARE GOOD AND NECESSARY THEY'RE NOT ACTIVELY HELPING ME TO IMPROVE MY CV OR STAND OUT FROM EVERYONE ELSE

ARE THERE ANY PARTICULARLY GOOD PROGRAMS I SHOULD BE LOOKING INTO ONES THAT ACCEPT AUS STUDENTS AND PREFERABLY DON'T STRAIN BUDGET TOO MUCH I'M PRETTY POOR ARE THERE EVENTS I SHOULD BE AIMING TO ATTEND RIGHT NOW I THINK I NEED TO MAKE MY NAME MORE VISIBLE AND BUILD CONNECTIONS BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO EVEN BEGIN
I'M NOT GONNA TRY TO BUTCHER AN EXPLANATION HERE BUT THESE VIDEOS FROM PBS SPACE TIME DELVE DEEPLY INTO WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FORCES AT PLAY IN EXPANSION AND THE BALANCE BETWEEN THEIR MAGNITUDES

PLAYLIST LIST LSPUH
WILL A FLAT UNIVERSE CONTAINING BOTH MATTER AND RADIATION ALWAYS BE DOMINATED BY RADIATION AT EARLY TIMES AND MATTER AT LATE TIMES

THAT DEPENDS DOES THIS FLAT UNIVERSE HAVE A BIG BANG ONE CAN IMAGINE A FLAT UNIVERSE THAT DIDN'T START THAT WAY

OR ARE YOU DESCRIBING THIS FLAT UNIVERSE IF SO ASSUMING A BIG BANG THEN YES SUCH A UNIVERSE BEGINS WITH ALL MASS-ENERGY ALREADY PRESENT EXTREMELY CONCENTRATED WHICH MEANS THE FORCES WE SEE AROUND US ARE COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED BY UNIFIED VERSIONS OF THOSE FORCES THAT RESULT FROM THE EARLY MASS-ENERGY CONCENTRATION ALL THIS ARGUES FOR VERY HIGH ENERGY LEVELS NO ATOMS AS WE UNDERSTAND THE TERM AND AN OPACITY RESULTING FROM THE ABSENCE OF ATOMS ABLE TO EMIT AND ABSORB PHOTONS

THEN MAKING ONE MORE ASSUMPTION I EAST THAT THE UNIVERSE EXPANDS FOREVER THE OLD UNIVERSE WILL BE DOMINATED BY MATTER BUT UNTIL RECENTLY THAT WAS AN UNANSWERED QUESTION YEARS AGO ONE COULD ARGUE THAT THE UNIVERSE MIGHT CYCLE ENDLESSLY BETWEEN HIGH AND LOW DENSITY DARK ENERGY SEEMS TO HAVE ELIMINATED THAT IDEA
HOW CAPABLE IS YOUR SIMULATOR ACTUALLY HOW MANY CUBITS CAN IT RUN IS IT ABLE TO RUN SOMETHING LIKE ALGORITHM
I MODELED AN EVAPORATING BLACK HOLE AS A QUANTUM SYSTEM USING PYTHON FOR MY MASTERS THESIS SO THIS PROGRAM INTERESTED ME I WAS CURIOUS AS TO WHETHER YOU USED QUIP QUICKLY GLANCING AT YOUR CODE I CAN SEE YOU DIDN'T SO I WAS WONDERING IF YOU HAVE HEARD OF IT IT IS A QUANTUM TOOLBOX FOR PYTHON AND WAS INVALUABLE FOR WHEN I WAS CODING MY MODEL

AT THE TIME I COULD ONLY MODEL A BLACK HOLE TO PARTICLES CUBITS IN SIZE SO I'M INTERESTED TO RUNNING THIS MODEL AND SEEING HOW THEY COMPARE IN COMPUTATIONAL POWER

ALL IN ALL I LOVE THIS PROJECT IT LOOKS AMAZING

EDIT LIVE TO LOVE
THIS IS A NICE SIMPLE SIMULATOR MAKE THE VECTORS MAKE THE MATRICES MULTIPLY EM TOGETHER SAMPLE THE RESULTS

YOU CAN SIMPLIFY THE GENERATE GATES FUNCTION BY USING THE KRONECKER PRODUCT WHICH IS IN BUMPY AS FOR EXAMPLE THE CUBIT MATRIX TO HIT THE THIRD CUBIT OUT OF FOUR WITH AN X GATE IS

IMPORT BUMPY AS NP
I 2
X
REDUCE I I X I

THIS DOESN'T QUITE WORK ON CHOTS SINCE YOU WANT TO MOVE THE CONTROL INDEPENDENTLY OF THE X BUT CONTROLS DON'T HAVE A MATRIX THEY'RE OPERATION MODIFIERS NOT OPERATIONS BUT YOU CAN CHEAT BY MARKING THE UNMET CONTROL CASES WITH ANS THEN FIXING THE MARKED VALUES

IMPORT BUMPY AS NP
DEF NANTOEYE M

RETURN M I J IF NOT M I J ELSE IF I J ELSE FOR J IN RANGE N FOR I IN RANGE N

I 2

THAT'S A VERY DRAMATIC TITLE PLEASE CONSIDER USING A TONED DOWN VERSION OF THE ARTICLE'S TITLE WHEN POSTING TO R PHYSICS THANKS
HAVING DEGREES IN ECONOMICS FINANCE AND PHYSICS I CAN TELL YOU IT IS ALWAYS BENEFICIAL TO SEEK ADDITIONAL KNOWLEDGE IF YOU CHOOSE TO GO THE ECONOMETRICS ROUTE IT MIGHT NOT EVEN BE STATISTICS THAT ENDS UP BEING BENEFICIAL TO YOU
THAT BEING SAID I OFTEN FOUND THAT STATISTICAL ANALYSIS IN ANY ECONOMIC SUBFIELD SEEMED TO BE A LOT LESS RIGOROUS THAN IN PHYSICS YOU PROBABLY WONT GAIN MUCH BEYOND SOME GENERAL PRACTICE IN DATA ANALYSIS ON THE OTHER HAND THE ECON GUYS REALLY DO HAVE A HAND FOR MODEL BUILDING SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO HANG OUT WITH SOME OF THOSE PROFS AND SEE HOW THEY WORK

I WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND TO THINK ABOUT GOING THE FINANCE ROUTE NOT JUST BECAUSE FINANCE DEGREES CAN LAND YOU VERY NICE JOBS IF YOU EVER FEEL LIKE YOU HAD ENOUGH OF PHYSICS BUT ALSO BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME MATHEMATICAL TOOLS THAT DIRECTLY STEM FROM PHYSICS EAST G THE EQUATION THAT WAS USED FOR PRICING DERIVATIVES RESULTING IN THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR ITS INVENTORS IS BASICALLY A HEAT DIFFUSION EQUATION AND HAS BEEN KNOWN TO PHYSICISTS FOR A LONG TIME
EXAMPLES
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF YOU CITED EXAMPLES OF SUCH METHODS SINCE MANY OF US HAVE NO IDEA WHAT ECONOMETRICS IS

PHYSICS HAS AN ENTIRE WELL-DEVELOPED SUBFIELD CALLED STATISTICAL MECHANICS WHICH HAS BEEN SOLVING PHYSICS PROBLEMS AS LONG IF NOT LONGER THAN STATISTICS HAVE BEEN SOLVING ECONOMIC PROBLEMS
THIS IS A NOT A ARTICLE SO THE CLAIMS SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH A GRAIN OF SALT
MAN IF THERE'S ONE ARTICLE THAT SHOULD HAVE CITED MY BUBBLE DYNAMICS PAPER IT'S THIS ONE
NEAT I'M CURRENTLY WORKING ON A SIMILAR ANALYSIS SEARCHING FOR BLACK HOLES AT CMS AT THIS POINT THOUGH I THINK IT'S PRETTY SAFE TO RULE OUT THE ADD MODEL MOST THEORISTS HAVE ABANDONED IT AS FAR AS I CAN TELL
NOT SURE IF THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BUT YOU CAN TREAT IT NOT AS A PHOTON GAS BUT AS A GAS CONSISTING OF PHOTONS ELECTRONS AND POSITRONS AT EQUILIBRIUM THE ELECTRONS AND POSITRONS WILL HAVE A DENSITY WHICH GOES SOMETHING LIKE T EXP M C 2 KT

YOU COULD INTERPRET THIS AS INTERACTIONS NAMELY PAIR PRODUCTION

SEE LANDAU FOR THE DETAILS
I ANSWERED QUESTION IN ASKSCIENCE BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'LL GET INTERACTIONS UNLESS THE EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURE OF THE PHOTON GAS EXCEEDS KEV
THEY SEE THE MOVEMENT OF NUCLEI THE NUCLEI DON'T CHANGE AT ALL NUCLEI ARE WHEREAS ATOMS ARE NM SO FACTOR BETWEEN THEM ALSO ENERGIES EV VS MEV
I JUST GOT BACK FROM THERE I WAS HELPING SETUP SOME NEW EXPERIMENTS WE ARE DOING THIS FALL WITH BED GLAD TO SEE MY FIELD GET SOME LOVE HERE
WASN'T SURE HOW LIGHT TRANSFERRED INFORMATION IN ANY CONTEXT THOUGH LOL

WHAT WE CALL LIGHT IS ACTUALLY ELECTROMAGNETIC ENERGY WHICH TRAVELS FREELY THROUGH SPACE AND WHICH COVERS A WIDE SPECTRUM FROM WAVELENGTHS LONGER THAN AM RADIO THROUGH GAMMA RAYS THE CONVERSATION WE'RE HAVING RIGHT NOW IS BEING SUPPORTED BY THE TRANSMISSION OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION THROUGH OPTICAL FIBERS ELECTRICAL CABLES AND THIN AIR

MORE HERE ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION
OBVIOUSLY QUANTUM ERROR CORRECTION YOU ALSO WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THE BACKGROUND OF THE READER IS YOU MIGHT WANT TO INTRODUCE SOME BASIC LINEAR ALGEBRA

I WOULDN'T BOTHER WITH D WAVE YOU'D HAVE TO INTRODUCE THE ENTIRE COMPUTATIONAL MODEL UNDERLYING IT ALSO IT WOULD VERY QUICKLY DATE YOUR BOOK WHEN THE TRUTH FINALLY COMES OUT WITHIN THE NEXT FEW YEARS IN GENERAL I'D BE VERY CAREFUL WITH REALISATIONS LIKE IF I WROTE A BOOK ABOUT PROGRAMMING IN JAVA WOULD I SUDDENLY JUMP INTO A PHYSICS DISCUSSION ABOUT NEW CHIP
INCLUDING SOME BACKGROUND ON QUANTUM STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND QUANTUM THERMODYNAMICS MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA
HONESTLY THERE ARE A LOT OF BOOKS THAT DO THIS FIELD REALLY WELL WHY DO YOU THINK YOU NEED TO WRITE A BOOK
MACHINE LEARNING
MERICA CHECKING IN I COULDN'T FIND A DECENT PAYING JOB RELATED TO PHYSICS SO NOW I'M IN AN ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING GRADUATE PROGRAM STUDYING NUCLEAR FORENSICS MORAL OF THE STORY IS THAT A PHYSICS BACKGROUND OPENS A LOT OF DOORS BUT CAN CLOSE OTHERS YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY
DATA SCIENCE SEEMS TO BE A POPULAR JOB DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU FOCUS ON DURING YOUR EDUCATION YOU COULD POTENTIALLY LOOK AT SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT OR SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AS WELL HOWEVER KEEP IN MIND THAT YOU'D BE COMPETING WITH PEOPLE WHO MAJORED IN COMPUTER SCIENCE FOR THESE JOBS SO IT WON'T REALLY BE EASY
I'VE JUST GRADUATED WITH A MASTERS IN THE UK AND BEEN APPLYING FOR JOBS THE MOST COMMON IS DEFINITELY SOFTWARE ENGINEERING SO MAKE SURE YOU LEARN SOME PROGRAMMING WHERE POSSIBLE YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A MASTER I'VE BEEN EXPLICITLY TOLD A LOT OF COMPANIES LOOK FOR PHYSICISTS MATHEMATICIANS ENGINEERS WITH STRONG ACADEMIC BACKGROUNDS RATHER THAN COMPUTER SCIENTISTS BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY OF THE MATHS IN DATA ANALYSIS ROLES FOR EXAMPLE AND YOU CAN ALWAYS PICK UP PROGRAMMING LIKELY IN A NEW LANGUAGE ON THE JOB
BEFORE DELVING INTO A RESEARCH PAPER YOU MIGHT CONSIDER LOOKING INTO THE BASICS OF CAVITY QED WHICH THIS ARTICLE FALLS UNDER MOST APPLICATIONS OF THIS TYPE OF THING RELATE TO QUANTUM COMPUTING AND OTHER ASPECTS OF QUANTUM INFORMATION SCIENCE

ONE THING ABOUT CAVITY QED IS THAT PHOTONS ARE EASIER TO UNDERSTAND THAN PHOTONS IN A VACUUM BECAUSE THEY'RE BASICALLY STANDING EM WAVES
DISCUSSION
OUR WORK ON TRIPARTITE MICROWAVE CORRELATIONS CAN BE EXTENDED
TOWARDS MULTIPARTITE ENTANGLED STATES
WHICH WOULD YIELD A
PLATFORM FOR UNIVERSAL QUANTUM COMPUTATION USING CV
AS RECENTLY PROPOSED IN REFORMATION FOR EXAMPLE THE CREATION OF
CLUSTER STATES IN MICROWAVE CAVITIES WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT STEP
TOWARDS REALIZING A SUPERCONDUCTING ONE-WAY COMPUTER SUCH
MULTIPARTITE ENTANGLED STATES REQUIRE PULSED MICROWAVE PUMPING
FOR ENTANGLING DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES A SCHEME THAT HAS BEEN
SHOWN TO BE A FULLY FUNCTIONING CONCEPT IN OUR WORK

EM DRIVE PASSES PEER REVIEW

NOT YET IT HASN'T A PAPER DESCRIBING EAGLEWORKS APPARATUS IS RUMORED TO HAVE PASSED PEER REVIEW IF THE RUMOR IS TRUE THAT'S NOT A DECLARATION THAT THE DRIVE WORKS

WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE HOPEFULLY THEY DID MORE REVERSALS AND TRIED TO ELIMINATE OTHER SOURCES OF SYSTEMATIC ERROR BUT IT MIGHT JUST BE A VERSION OF THIS REPORT PREVIOUSLY CIRCULATED DESCRIBING THEIR APPARATUS AND PROCEDURE WHEN THE PAPER IS PUBLISHED AND IF WE ALL CAN GET A COPY WE CAN DISCUSS IT UNTIL THEN WE'LL CONTINUE OUR MORATORIUM ON POSTS THE SAME BETIMES LINK IS ON THE FRONT PAGE OF R FUTUROLOGY TODAY SO PLEASE CLICK OVER THERE FOR THE REGULAR

THIS COMMENTS SECTION IS BECAUSE OF THE DRAMA THAT USUALLY ACCOMPANIES POSTS BUT IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO HAZARD A GUESS AS TO POSSIBLE UNCONTROLLED SYSTEMATIC EFFECTS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT WHITE ET AL IS MEASURING FEEL FREE

SOFT LOCKED COMMENTS SECTION YOUR COMMENTS WILL NOT BE VISIBLE UNTIL A HUMAN REVIEWS THEM JUST BE ESPECIALLY NICE AND REMEMBER THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT CRACKPOTS OR FOR BIG SCIENCE
I WAS ALWAYS TOLD THAT MOMENTUM IS THE MOST INVIOLABLE CONSERVATION LAW


THIS ISN'T RELATED TO THE EM DRIVE AT ALL AND IT IS NOT AN ENDORSEMENT BUT I'D LIKE TO GENTLY COMMENT ON THE NATURE OF CONSERVATION LAWS

THEOREM TELLS US THAT WE GET A CONSERVATION LAW FOR EACH SYMMETRY OF A SYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE IF A SYSTEM LOOKS THE SAME WHEN YOU ROTATE AROUND SOME ORIGIN YOU GET ANGULAR MOMENTUM CONSERVATION IF IT LOOKS THE SAME AS YOU WALK IN A STRAIGHT LINE YOU GET LINEAR MOMENTUM CONSERVATION I'LL IGNORE INTERNAL SYMMETRIES OF A FIELD FOR NOW

SO IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE EASY TO CONSTRUCT SITUATIONS WHERE MOMENTUM IS NOT CONSERVED DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU CALL YOUR SYSTEM

CONSIDER A CART ON A ROLLER COASTER TRACK THE TOTAL ENERGY OF THE CART IS CONSERVED AS IT GOES UP AND DOWN IN THE TRACK BUT THE VELOCITY OF THE CART IS CHANGING SO IT'S MOMENTUM IS NOT CONSERVED

NOW IF YOU INCLUDE THE TRACK AND THE EARTH INTO THE SYSTEM THEN THE TOTAL MOMENTUM IS CONSERVED BECAUSE THE SPACE IN WHICH WE INHABIT IS INDEED TRANSLATION INVARIANT BUT MY POINT IS THAT CONSERVATION LAWS ARE MORE SUBTLE THAN THIS QUANTITY IS UNCHANGING

IN THE CASE OF THE EM DRIVE THE CLAIM IS THAT THE DRIVE IS GETTING MOMENTUM FROM NOWHERE WHICH IS WHAT MAKES PHYSICISTS MYSELF INCLUDED UNCOMFORTABLE

I'M NOT SURE WHY I WROTE ALL THIS BUT I HOPE IT HELPS SOMEONE
OK I HAVE SOME OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE PAPER THE MOD LINKED TO

THEY PUT THE CAVITY ON ONE ARM OF A HOMEBUILD TORSION BALANCE THE RF ELECTRONICS ARE ON THE OTHER ARM AND THE WHOLE THING FINDS ITS OWN EQUILIBRIUM POSITION THE BALANCE IS MAGNETICALLY DAMPED TO MAKE A MEASUREMENT THEY APPLY A KNOWN FORCE ELECTROSTATICALLY AND MEASURE THE DISPLACEMENT THIS GIVES THEM THE SPRING CONSTANT FOR THE TORSION BALANCE IN WHATEVER EQUILIBRIUM CONFIGURATION IT FOUNDATION THEN THEY TURN THE RF ON AND OFF TUNED NOMINALLY ON RESONANCE WITH THE CAVITY AND MONITOR THE DISPLACEMENT I'M SKIPPING A LOT OF DETAILS AND THAT'S WHY YOU'VE GOT TO READ THE PAPER

I SEE A COUPLE OF POTENTIAL AREAS FOR ERROR ONE IS THE MAGNETIC DAMPER THERE IS A STRONG PERMANENT MAGNET ATTACHED TO THE BALANCE ARM OPPOSITE THE CAVITY ANY STRAY DC MAGNETIC FIELD THAT IS COINCIDENT WITH APPLICATION OF THE RF TO THE CAVITY WILL TILT THE BALANCE AND LOOK JUST LIKE THRUST THE AUTHORS NOTE THAT THEY ALREADY FOUND ONE SUCH SOURCE OF ERROR AND ELIMINATED IT BUT IT REMAINS AN OBVIOUS ENTRY POINT FOR ERROR ALMOST A LITERAL FINGER ON THE SCALE

BUT THE THING I IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT OF WAS FARADAY INDUCED PUSHING OFF OF THE CHAMBER WALLS AND SUPPORT STRUCTURE YOU CAN FLOAT AN ALUMINUM PLATE ABOVE AN RF GENERATOR I CAN IMAGINE THE SAME THING HAPPENING HERE IF THERE IS A LARGE LEAKAGE FIELD ANYWHERE FROM THE CAVITY OR THE CONNECTORS TO THE CAVITY THE LEAKAGE CAN INDUCE CURRENTS IN THE SURROUNDING METAL VIA THE FARADAY EFFECT AND REPEL THE SOURCE

THAT'S ALL I GOT NOW THERE ARE A LOT OF UNEXPLAINED THINGS IN THE REPORT HOPEFULLY THE ACTUAL PAPER WILL BE MORE DETAILED

I AGREE WITH THE MORATORIUM ON RELATIONLESS DRIVES IN R PHYSICS

I CAN UNDERSTAND ALLOWING EM DRIVE ARTICLES IN PLACES LIKE R ENGINEERING R SCIENCE AND OCCASIONALLY R NEWS BUT NOT HERE PHYSICS IS CONCERNED PRIMARILY WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF HOW PHYSICAL SYSTEMS WORK
THERE WAS AN EMDRIVE THEORY PAPER POSTED HERE A FEW MONTHS AGO I HAD A GOOD TIME DEMOLISHING IT
HOW CREDIBLE IS THE JOURNAL IN QUESTION
REMOVED
THAT SHOULD BE FINE I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING TOO ADVANCED BEING ON THE SAT SO DON'T THINK A NEWER EDITION WOULD HAVE ANYTHING THAT AN OLDER WOULDN'T
DELETED
WHEN PEOPLE USE THE TERM FALSE ACCUM ARE THEY USING ACCUM IN THE SAME CONTEXT AS WHEN PEOPLE SAY SPACE IS A ACCUM IF WE ARE IN A FALSE ACCUM DOES THAT MEAN THAT SPACE IS NOT TRULY A ACCUM JUST VERY VERY CLOSE

THINK OF A TRUE VACUUM AS THE GROUND STATE OR LOWEST ENERGY DENSITY STATE POSSIBLE THERE IS REASON TO BELIEVE THE UNIVERSE IS NOT IN THE GROUND STATE BUT INSTEAD IN A HIGHER ENERGY LEVEL METASTABLE FALSE VACUUM STATE THAT IT SETTLED INTO AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE UNIVERSE EAST G AFTER AN EXPONENTIALLY EXPANSIVE INFLATIONARY PERIOD ENDED WHICH IS THE LEADING POSSIBILITY FOR HOW THIS STATE MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED FOR A VISUAL DEPICTION OF THIS DIFFERENCE SEE THE GRAPHIC IN THIS ARTICLE WHERE THE FALSE AND TRUE STATES ARE LABELED AND ARE AT SHOWN DIFFERENT ENERGY DENSITY LEVELS SEPARATED BY A BARRIER

THERE ARE LOTS OF ADDITIONAL DETAILS INVOLVED EAST G SEE THE ABOVE CITED ARTICLE BUT THAT ALONG WITH REPLY IS THE BASIC SITUATION
PHYSICS IS DIFFICULT TRY NOT TO FEEL DEFEATED BY IT BECAUSE EVERYONE HITS A WALL SOMEWHERE IN SOME FIELD AND THEY JUST HAVE TO FIND A WAY AROUND IT

IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE DOING THE THINGS MOST PEOPLE WOULD ADVISE YOU TO START WITH BUT IT STILL ISN'T CLICKING ANY TIME YOU END UP IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS WHERE ALL EFFORT SEEMS TO BE MAKING NO PROGRESS TAKE A STEP BACK AND LOOK FOR WHY YOU AREN'T GRASPING THE CONCEPTS IS IT THAT YOU ARE LACKING THE MATHEMATICAL UNDERSTANDING IS THE NOMENCLATURE ELUDING YOU IS IT DIFFICULT TO VISUALIZE THESE PROBLEMS ONCE YOU IDENTIFY THE STUMBLING BLOCK YOU HAVE YOU CAN BEGIN TO ATTEMPT TO WORK PAST IT

IF YOU CAN'T FIND A PARTICULAR SKILL OR CONCEPTUAL STUMBLING BLOCK THEN HERE ARE SOME OTHER THINGS TO TRY FIND ANOTHER STUDENT S AND TRY STUDYING IN GROUPS TAKE IT FROM A PHYSICS TEACHER YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE IN CLASS STRUGGLING WORKING THROUGH PROBLEMS TOGETHER LETS YOU SEE THE APPROACH OTHERS TAKE TO THE PROBLEM AND HEARING OTHER STUDENT EXPLANATIONS FOR PROBLEMS CAN BE A HUGE ASSET YOU CAN ALSO TRY TO SOLVE A PROBLEM THEN THAT PROBLEM AND EXPLAIN EACH STEP AND VARIABLE ASSIGNMENT IN DETAIL GOING OVER THE MATERIAL A SECOND TIME IN EXPLICIT TERMS CAN HELP YOU CEMENT THE CONCEPTS IF YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE WITH VISUALIZATION YOU CAN EITHER LOOK FOR VIDEOS OF THE CONCEPT BEING DEMONSTRATED OR FIND A PHYSICAL OBJECT TO HELP YOU BETTER UNDERSTAND IT FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING TORQUE AT A CONCEPTUAL LEVEL GRAB A PENCIL AND A BALL OF PLAYDOUGH OR CLAY AND STICK VARYING AMOUNTS OF THE CLAY TO THE END OR MIDDLE OF THE PENCIL AND FEEL HOW IT CHANGES HOW HARD IT IS TO HOLD UP THE PENCIL I DO THIS IN LAB CLASSES WITH ROLLS OF DUCT TAPE AND METER STICKS SO STUDENTS CAN GET A HANDS ON FEEL FOR THE CONCEPT
I'M TIRED AND I FEEL DEFEATED ANYTIME I HAVE TO GO TO PHYSICS BECAUSE I JUST FEEL DUMB AND LIKE A FAILURE

THAT'S NORMAL IN PHYSICS PARTLY BECAUSE IT'S A SUBJECT THAT REQUIRES A DIFFERENT WAY OF THINKING THAN MOST SUBJECTS BUT ALSO BECAUSE A LOT OF PROFESSORS ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY BAD AT TEACHING IT THEY'VE FORGOTTEN WHAT IT'S LIKE TO SEE THIS MATERIAL FOR THE FIRST TIME AND SPEND LOTS OF CLASS TIME GOING THROUGH PROOFS WHICH I THINK IS PRETTY USELESS WHEN IT COMES TO HELPING STUDENTS UNDERSTAND CONCEPTS AND WORK OUT PROBLEMS ALSO YOU'RE MOVING FROM ONE TOPIC TO ANOTHER SO QUICKLY IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE LEARNING ONE WEEK YOU'RE LEARNING ABOUT HEAT TRANSFER AND THE NEXT YOU'RE LEARNING ABOUT FLUID DYNAMICS AND THEN MOMENT OF INERTIA IN THAT WAY THE INTRO COURSES ARE ACTUALLY MUCH HARDER THAN THE HIGHER LEVEL CLASSES SURE THE MATH MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT IN A CLASS THAT'S DEDICATED TO ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM BUT AT LEAST IT'S ALL THE SAME CONCEPT SO YOU'RE NEVER ASKING YOURSELF WHAT AM I EVEN LEARNING HERE

IF YOU CAN FIND A STUDY GROUP TO WORK WITH THAT SHOULD HELP A LOT THERE ARE USUALLY MULTIPLE WAYS OF GOING ABOUT SOLVING A PROBLEM AND LEARNING HOW DIFFERENT PEOPLE GO ABOUT TACKLING THESE PROBLEMS COULD HELP EXPLAIN THINGS IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE TO YOU AND IT'S A LOT LESS DRAINING TO BE WITH A GROUP BOUNCING IDEAS OFF EACH OTHER THAN IT IS SITTING ALONE SPENDING AN HOUR JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO START WORKING ON A PROBLEM

MY GENERAL TECHNIQUE WHILE IN SCHOOL WAS TO FIND AS MANY RESOURCES AS I COULD TO EXPLAIN A CONCEPT I WASN'T GETTING SOMETIMES ALL IT TAKES IS HEARING SOMETHING EXPLAINED IN A PARTICULAR WAY TO MAKE IT ALL CLICK FOR YOU OR YOU'LL GO THROUGH SEEING A TOPIC EXPLAINED SO MANY DIFFERENT TIMES THAT YOU FIND YOURSELF ABLE TO PREDICT WHAT THEY'RE ABOUT TO SAY AT WHICH POINT YOU'VE GOT A PRETTY FIRM GRASP ON THE MATERIAL THAT BEING SAID HERE'S A LIST OF RESOURCES

SOMEBODY ALREADY MENTIONED KHAN ACADEMY WHICH ALL STUDENTS EVERYWHERE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY TIMES I'VE WATCHED A VIDEO AND THOUGHT WAIT THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO THIS WHY DID NOBODY JUST SAY THAT BEFORE

BRIGHTSTORM IS ALSO GREAT MAYBE EVEN BETTER THAN KHAN SINCE TOPICS ARE BROKEN DOWN INTO VIDEOS THAT ARE GENERALLY NO MORE THAN MINUTES

HYPERPHYSICS IS ALSO PRETTY NICE WITH PHYSICS TOPICS BROKEN DOWN SUCCINCTLY AND EXAMPLE PROBLEMS WHERE YOU CAN EVEN PUT NUMBERS IN TO FIND THE RESULT

THERE'S ALSO THE PHYSICS HYPERTEXTBOOK WHICH I ADMIT I HAVEN'T REALLY USED MYSELF BUT IT LOOKS LIKE A NICE RESOURCE WITH PLENTY OF LINKS THAT LETS YOU GO RIGHT TOWARDS WHATEVER TOPIC IS GIVING YOU TROUBLE

PHYSICS OUTLINE IS A BOOK THAT HAS LOTS OF PROBLEMS ON ANY POSSIBLE TYPE OF PROBLEM YOU'RE GOING TO ENCOUNTER ONCE YOU SEE THAT MOST PROBLEMS WITHIN A CHAPTER ARE JUST THE SAME VARIATION ON OR DIFFERENT EQUATIONS YOU'LL REALIZE A LOT OF PROBLEMS ARE DECEPTIVELY SIMPLE YOU'D HAVE TO PAY FOR IT BUT I SWEAR IT'S WORTH EVERY PENNY

THE FEYNMAN LECTURES ARE A NICE PHYSICS RESOURCE IF YOU'RE NOT ALREADY FAMILIAR FEYNMAN WAS BRILLIANT WHEN IT CAME TO BREAKING DOWN HIGH LEVEL PHYSICS TOPICS IN WAYS THAT ANYBODY COULD UNDERSTAND EVEN HIS BOOK ON QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS IS WRITTEN SO THAT ANYBODY COULD LEARN FROM IT ONE PARTICULAR EXAMPLE I REMEMBER FROM THAT BOOK GOES SOMETHING LIKE IMAGINE YOU'VE GOT A SPINNING CLOCK AND AT EVERY MOMENT IN TIME YOU DRAW AN ARROW IN THE DIRECTION THE SMALLEST HAND IS POINTING THEN YOU PUT ALL THOSE ARROWS IN A ROW AND YOU CAN SEE HOW THE DIRECTION TRAVELED BY FITTING ALL THE ARROWS TOGETHER IMAGINE THAT WE LEARNED SOMETHING ABOUT LIGHT JUST BY DRAWING SOME DAMNED ARROWS

DDX HAS COURSES THAT ANYBODY CAN SIGN UP FOR FOR FREE AND WITHOUT OBLIGATION THESE ARE COURSES THAT CONTAIN LECTURES AND NOTES FROM PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITIES LIKE HARVARD AND MIT I FIND IT HELPFUL TO SIGN UP FOR A COURSE AND RAID THEIR MATERIALS FOR NOTES AND VIDEO LECTURES THEN DROP THE COURSE WHEN I GET WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR

AND ON THAT NOTE YOU CAN TRY SEARCHING YOUTUBE FOR WALTER LEWIN HE'S ALSO WELL KNOWN FOR BEING A GOOD PHYSICS LECTURER I'M PERSONALLY RATHER INDIFFERENT ABOUT HIS LECTURES BUT LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE THINK HE'S GREAT SO I'LL MENTION HIM IN FACT JUST GO ON YOUTUBE AND SEARCH FOR PHYSICS TERMS UNTIL YOU FIND A PARTICULAR CHANNEL THAT YOU LIKE

NOTES IS GREAT FOR MATH TOPICS ON ADVANCED MATH LIKE CALCULUS LINEAR ALGEBRA AND DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

PURPLE MATH IS ALSO A MATH SITE THAT'S JUST REALLY GREAT AT VISUALIZING THE INFORMATION AND MAKING EVEN REALLY ADVANCED TOPICS EASILY DIGESTIBLE

FOR MORE MATH RESOURCES WOLFRAMALPHA USED TO BE GREAT A FEW YEARS AGO BUT NOW THEY MAKE YOU GET AN ACCOUNT AND YOU NEED TO PAY FOR MORE THAN ONE SOLUTION PER DAY HOWEVER PATHWAY SYMBOLAB CYATH THE DERIVATIVE CALCULATOR AND THIS MICROSOFT PROGRAM ARE ALL ONLINE MATH PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW YOU TO INPUT A PROBLEM AND IT WILL SHOW NOT JUST THE SOLUTION BUT THE STEPS TO GET TO THAT SOLUTION OF COURSE IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO USE THIS TOO MUCH AS A CRUTCH TO GET YOUR HOMEWORK DONE WITHOUT PUTTING IN ANY THOUGHT OR EFFORT BUT IT'S A GREAT TOOL FOR WHEN YOU'RE STUCK ON A PROBLEM AND NEED TO SEE HOW TO GET TO A PARTICULAR SOLUTION SO HOPEFULLY YOU'LL USE IT RESPONSIBLY

EDUCATOR IS ALSO REALLY GOOD AT PROVIDING RELATIVELY SHORT VIDEOS ON A RANGE OF TOPICS I'VE ONLY REALLY BROWSED THROUGH THEIR VIDEOS ON DE BUT THEY DID A REALLY GOOD JOB AT BREAKING DOWN COMPLEX PROBLEMS IN A WAY THAT I THINK EVEN A HIGH SCHOOLER COULD UNDERSTAND

SIMPLE WIKIPEDIA IS ANOTHER ONE I HAVEN'T USED MUCH MYSELF BUT I'M SURE COULD BE USEFUL GIVEN HOW REGULAR WIKIPEDIA PAGES ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ARE OFTEN WRITTEN ABOVE EVEN MY LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING

CHEGO IS A PAY SITE BUT IT HAS TEXTBOOK SOLUTIONS YOU CAN USE UNFORTUNATELY IT CHANGED ITS RATINGS SYSTEM FOR THEIR PROBLEMS A WHILE BACK IN A WAY THAT MADE THE SITE NEARLY WORTHLESS BUT IT CAN STILL HELP YOU GET AN IDEA FOR HOW TO WORK A PROBLEM OUT
I REMEMBER WISHING I COULD GO BACK TO MYSELF IN MY FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS AT UNIVERSITY AND TELL ME THIS NUGGET I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU

IF YOU EVER DON'T UNDERSTAND SOMETHING STRAIGHT AWAY DON'T TRY TO INSTEAD JUST LEARN THE MATHS AND THEORY AND MOVE ON

IT WILL BECOME CLEAR BUT ONLY BY CONTINUING WITH SUBJECT AND THEN APPLYING IT IN EXAMPLES I REMEMBER LOTS OF TIMES FEELING STUPID THAT I SPENT SO LONG AGONISING OVER BASIC STUFF WHEN JUST APPLYING IT FOR A WHILE WAS ENOUGH

IT'S ALSO JUST HOW YOUR BRAIN WORKS IF SOMETHING DIDN'T CLICK IT PROBABLY WON'T UNTIL YOU COME BACK TO IT LATER

THERE'S ALSO A BIT OF A TRAP AT ANY LEVEL IN PHYSICS TO OVERCOMPLICATE THINGS AND OR CONSTANTLY SEEK A FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING THAT'S PUTTING THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE JUST TAKE ONE THING AT A TIME AND KEEP THE BALL ROLLING

IN A WAY YOU'RE RIGHT TO FIND THE BASIC CONCEPTS DIFFICULT BUT YOU ONLY LEARN WHY BY ACCEPTING THEM ON FACE VALUE AND USING THEM
KHAN ACADEMY HAS SINGLE-HANDEDLY TAUGHT ME EVERYTHING I HAVE EVER NEEDED TO KNOW ABOUT ANY COURSE I HAVE EVER STRUGGLED IN
JOIN A STUDY GROUP OFTEN TIMES PROFESSORS DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN THINGS AT A BASIC LEVEL UNDERSTANDING HOW YOUR PEERS DO PROBLEMS THOUGH CAN BE VERY HELPFUL


I WOULD RECOMMEND TRYING THE FEYNMAN TECHNIQUE

VERY SIMPLY PUT IT CONSISTS OF PRETENDING YOU'RE TEACHING SOMEONE WHO KNOWS LESS THAN YOU ABOUT THE SUBJECT MATTER SO YOU BASICALLY NEED TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING VERY CLEARLY AND USING THE SIMPLEST TERMINOLOGY POSSIBLE THIS TECHNIQUE IS GREAT FOR IDENTIFYING THE SPECIFIC PARTS OF THE MATERIAL THAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND SO IT ALLOWS YOU TO ASK BETTER AND MORE FOCUSED QUESTIONS AS OPPOSED TO JUST SAYING I DON'T GET THIS PLEASE EXPLAIN GENERAL RELATIVITY ALL OVER AGAIN YOU CAN DO IT WITH WRITING OR JUST SPEAKING OUT LOUD IT HAS WORKED BOTH WAYS FOR ME

HOPE THAT HELPS
WHEN I HAD PROBLEMS I READ DIFFERENT BOOKS ON THE SAME SUBJECT SINCE THEY OFTEN EXPLAIN THE SAME PROBLEM FROM A DIFFERENT POV I AFTER THAT I JUMPED TO MATH AND WENT THROUGH EQUATIONS FEW TIMES JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND EVERY STEP AND COMPARED IT WITH THE WRITTEN THEORY AFTER THAT I SEARCHED FOR EXPLAINED EXAMPLES TRIED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM BY MYSELF IT REALLY HELPED ME THAT I DIDN'T FEEL DISCOURAGED BUT I FELT CHALLENGED WHEN I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND SOMETHING
MOST SOLUTIONS TO PHYSICAL PROBLEMS YOU WILL ENCOUNTER IN PHYSICS HAVE SOME FUNDAMENTAL LAWS UNDERPINNING THEM
ONE APPROACH I FOUND SUCCESSFUL FOR MYSELF WAS TO TRY AND SEE FOR ANY GIVEN EQUATION SCENARIO PROBLEM HOW THINGS LIKE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY OR CONSERVATION OF MOMENTUM ARE REPRESENTED THE CONSERVATION LAWS ARE INTUITIVE AND FINDING HOW THEY APPLY CAN HELP MAKE COMPLEX EQUATIONS INTUITIVE TOO
KEEP LOOKING OVER EXAMPLES AND DOING PROBLEMS WITH GUIDED SOLUTIONS AT SOME POINT THE PHYSICS SHOULD JUST CLICK OR AT THE LEAST YOU UNDERSTAND THE METHODOLOGY TO SOLVE THEM AND PASS THE CLASSICAL
THIS IS COMPLETELY FROM MY POINT OF VIEW
I THINK FOR PHYSICS YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE BASICS CONCEPTS PROPERLY DDK THE RIGHT WORD BUT IF YOU JUST READ OR TRY TO BREEZE THROUGH AT A POINT YOU WILL HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU ARE DEALING WITH EVERYTHING BUILDS ON TO SOLVE A PROBLEM YOU START WITH WHAT YOU HAVE AND IF YOUR BASICS CONCEPTS IS CLEAR YOU KNOW HOW TO TACKLE IT EVEN IF YOU DONT KNOW HOW TO EXACTLY SOLVE AT FIRST YOU CAN BREAK THE PROBLEM IN TO SMALLER PROBLEMS AND TRY TO SOLVE ONE STEP AT A TIME
WHEN I CAME TO GRAD SCHOOL I HAD FEW OF THE CONCEPTS NOT SO CLEAR AND HAD TO SPEND EXTRA TIME IN LEARNING THEM PROPERLY WHICH WAS TIME WELL SPENT ALSO DIFFERENT PEOPLE LEARN DIFFERENTLY MAY BE THE WAY SOME OF THESE CONCEPTS I LEARNT IN UNDERGRAD WAS NOT CLICKING TO ME BUT THE WAY MY FRIENDS EXPLAINED IT TO ME HELPED A LOT SO TRY TO FIND SOMEONE WHO CAN EXPLAIN YOU YOU CAN ASK YOUR CLASSMATES ABOUT HOW THEY UNDERSTAND FEW THINGS YOU HAVE HARD TIME TO UNDERSTAND THEIR ANALOGY OR UNDERSTANDING MIGHT HELP YOU UNDERSTAND IT BETTER
IT'S A SKILL SKILLS GET BETTER WITH PRACTICE BLOCK SOME TIME OUT DAILY TO PRACTICE DO YOUR HOMEWORK UNTIL YOU DON'T NEED THE BOOK
PHYSICS CAN BE COUNTERINTUITIVE UNTIL YOU GET IT

ONE NOVEL APPROACH TO UNDERSTANDING THE BASICS IS THIS BOOK
I SAW THIS POST ON A RANDOM SELECTION I'M NOT A PHYSICIST OUT NOTHING IN PARTICULAR BUT TODAY I WAS LISTENING TO THIS PODCAST CALL STARTALK WITH NIEL DEGRASSE TYSON AND HE AND HIS GUESS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MULTIVERSE AND QUANTUM PHYSICS HIS COHOST WHICH IS A COMEDIAN SAID HE HAD NO IDEA WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SO NIEL REPLIED THAT MOST PPL REALLY DON'T AND IF THEY THINK THEY DO IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T THAT MOST PPL JUST STICK WITH DOING THE MATH AND MEMORIZING IT'S KINDA DUMB AND MAYBE UNRELATED BUT I HOPE IT HELPS
WHEN YOU TAKE NOTES DO YOU REALLY UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING YOU ARE WRITING DOWN ARE YOU ABLE TO DERIVE EVERY STEP THAT THEY ARE SHOWING YOU DO YOU JUST COPY DOWN WHAT IS WRITTEN OR ARE YOU ABLE TO FOLLOW THE LOGIC PRECISELY EVEN BEING ABLE TO REPEAT IT THE DAY AFTER

WHEN YOU ATTEMPT PROBLEMS DO YOU TRY FOR A FEW MINUTES BEFORE GIVING UP AND LOOKING AT THE ANSWER SHEETS TO LEARN HOW TO DO IT NEXT TIME OR DO YOU STARE AT IT FOR HOURS ON END REFUSING TO GIVE UP TRYING A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS UNTIL AT SOME POINT IT ALL CLICKS

THESE WERE THE BIGGEST THINGS I LEARNED IN MY UNDERGRADUATE THE FIRST FEW YEARS WERE SPENT GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS OF LEARNING BUT NOT ACTUALLY MAKING SURE IT STUCK

BEING ABLE TO REPEAT AND UNDERSTAND EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF A DERIVATION AND SPENDING HOURS ON A SINGLE PROBLEM THAT I WAS STUCK ON WAS IN THE END HOW I MANAGED TO PUSH THROUGH AND GET A GOOD GRADE BEFORE THAT I WAS JUST GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS YES IT WAS PAINFUL BUT ALSO MADE ME A GOOD PHYSICIST
THE ONE MINUTE PHYSICS SERIES ON YOUTUBE CAN HELP TRY IT
PHYSICS IS LIKE A SPORT THE ONLY WAY YOU GET BETTER IS PRACTICE DOING PRACTICE PROBLEMS HELPS SHAPE YOUR CONCEPTUAL KNOWLEDGE AND INTUITION
PHYSICS REQUIRES A CERTAIN LEVEL OF META COGNITION THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T NATURALLY USE IT SOUNDS FANCY BUT BASICALLY THIS MEANS ASSESSING YOUR OWN LEARNING BY ASKING YOURSELF WHY YOU GOT THIS PROBLEM WRONG WHICH CONCEPTS OR KEY WORDS AM I HAVING TROUBLE WITH DO I NEED A REFRESHER ON WHAT THIS CONCEPT IS IF YOU THINK ALONG THOSE LINES WHILE STUDYING AND SOLVING PROBLEMS YOU WILL HAVE MORE SUCCESS
TO BE HONEST EVEN AS A GRADUATE STUDENT I HAVE DIFFICULTIES UNDERSTANDING A PHYSICAL CONCEPT AT TIMES PHYSICS FOR ALL OF ITS TRAITS PERTAINING TO THE REAL WORLD CAN BE AN ABSTRACT SUBJECT TO LEARN AT THE CORE I BELIEVE THAT THE ISSUE COMES FROM NOT DEVELOPING THE CORRECT PHYSICAL INTUITION BECAUSE THE MATHEMATICS IS USUALLY PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD

THAT BEING SAID LEARNING PHYSICS CAN BE REWARDING IF TAUGHT PROPERLY THE FIRST THING THAT I DID TO LEARN PHYSICS MORE EFFECTIVELY WAS TO IDENTIFY WHAT TYPE OF LEARNER I AM THAT IS DO I UNDERSTAND CONCEPTS BETTER IF IT IS PRESENTED IN AN AUDITORY WAY A VISUAL WAY OR IF I TEACH MYSELF I FOUND THAT PERSONALLY TEACHING MYSELF AND WATCHING PHYSICS CONTENT WAS THE BEST WAY TO LEARN

IDENTIFYING YOUR PREFERRED WAY OF LEARNING GOES A LONG WAY TO UNDERSTANDING THE SUBJECT THIS MIGHT NOT HELP BUT CONSIDER TAKING SOME TIME TO ASK YOURSELF WHY AM I DOING BETTER IN OTHER CLASSES WHAT DO I DO DIFFERENTLY WHEN STUDYING FOR MY OTHER CLASSES AND INCORPORATE THOSE ANSWERS INTO THE WAY YOU STUDY PHYSICS

OTHER THAN THAT I FEEL FOR YOU SINCE YOU'RE REALLY DOING ALL THAT YOU CAN TO LEARN THE SUBJECT I HOPE THIS HELPS
WHAT LEVEL OF PHYSICS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE YOU SAY YOU DON'T GET THE BASICS BUT YOU MUST BE EXAGGERATING RIGHT YOU KNOW LAWS YOU KNOW WHAT DISPLACEMENT VELOCITY AND ACCELERATION ARE CORRECT
I BELIEVE FEYNMAN SAID IF YOU THINK YOU UNDERSTAND QUANTUM MECHANICS YOU REALLY DON'T OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT I BELIEVE THERE ARE A LOT OF THING LIKE THAT IN PHYSICS
PROGRAM WHAT YOU LEARN ONCE THE BEHAVIOR EMERGES CORRECTLY IN THE SIMULATION THAT IS A VALIDATION MORE VALUABLE THAN ANY TEST THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF THE CONCEPT
VERY CAREFULLY
ANYWHERE THAT MATHEMATICAL MODELING IS USED THERE WILL BE PHYSICISTS EMPLOYED TO SOME DEGREE
THERE IS FREQUENT CROSS OVER BETWEEN MEDICAL RESEARCH AND BIOPHYSICS WHICH IS OFTEN DONE FROM A COMPUTATIONAL OR THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE WITH RESPECT TO GENETICS BIOPHYSICS PROBABLY IS THE MOST DIRECT ROUTE TO STUDY THIS SUBJECT FROM A THEORETICAL VIEWPOINT

IF YOU WERE WILLING TO ENTERTAIN WORKING WITH MODELING MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY IS QUITE CLOSE TO MEDICAL PHYSICS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS NOT ONLY CAN ONLY OBTAIN A PHD IN MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY AFTER AN UNDERGRADUATE IN PHYSICS ALTHOUGH THIS IS DIFFICULT MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGISTS OFTEN WORK IN IMAGING GENETICS PROTEIN FOLDING NEUROSCIENCE AND IN POPULATION DYNAMICS
SO YOUR MODEL IS OF A CYLINDER WITH LIQUID IN IT ROTATING AND YOU WANT TO SIMULATE THE SHAPE OF THE SURFACE YES

BECAUSE THE MODEL IS RELATIVELY SIMPLE YOU HAVE TWO CHOICES YOU CAN CREATE AN ANALYTICAL MODEL THAT ACCEPTS THE CYLINDER'S DIMENSIONS AND ROTATION RATE THEN MODEL THE SURFACE USING EQUATIONS OR YOU CAN CREATE A NUMERICAL MODEL THAT SOLVES A RATHER COMPLEX DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION THAT MODELS THE LIQUID SURFACE IN SECTIONS THAT INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER

IN MANY CASES A NUMERICAL MODEL IS SIMPLER THAN A SOLUTION WHERE ONE EXISTS BUT IN THIS CASE I SUSPECT THAT THE REVERSE IS TRUE THE LIQUID SURFACE NUMERICAL MODEL WOULD NEED TO BE BROKEN INTO SECTIONS THE MORE THE BETTER EACH INTERACTING WITH ITS NEIGHBORS A ANALYTICAL SOLUTION WOULD MODEL THE LIQUID SURFACE AS A PARABOLA WHOSE PROPERTIES WOULD BE DETERMINED BY THE RATE OF ROTATION A RELATIVELY EASY MODEL TO CREATE

IF YOUR ASSIGNMENT IS TO CREATE A NUMERICAL MODEL THEN YOU HAVE NO CHOICE ABOUT IT BUT IF THE NATURE OF THE MODEL IS UP TO YOU I WOULD SUGGEST EXAMINING BOTH OPTIONS TO SEE WHICH PRODUCES THE MOST USEFUL INFORMATION

I'M NOT A COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS MAJOR BUT I FINISHED SEVERAL COURSES ON COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS DURING MY BSC AND COMPUTATIONAL SOFT MATTER PHYSICS AND COMPUTATIONAL MANY BODY PHYSICS DURING MY MASTER'S MY BROTHER GRADUATED IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
I CAN'T REALLY TELL YOU ABOUT JOB CHANCES BUT WHAT I NOTICED IS THAT WHILE MY BROTHER IS MUCH STRONGER ON THE THEORETICAL SIDE OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT YOU CAN BASICALLY TELL ALL MY APPLICATIONS WERE WRITTEN BY A SCIENTIST AND NOT BY A CS MAJOR AND HE'LL KNOW ABOUT THE METHODS FOR MACHINE LEARNING HE REGULARLY CONSULTS ME WHEN IT COMES TO DATA ANALYSIS AND EVEN SOME NUMERICAL METHODS

SO HIS CS DEGREE PREPARED HIM WAY BETTER FOR ACTUALLY WRITING GOOD CODE AND DESIGNING APPLICATIONS FROM A CODE PERSPECTIVE NOT VISUALLY AND HE KNOWS THE THEORY BEHIND ALL OF THIS WAY BETTER THEN ME ON THE OTHER HAND MY PHYSICS DEGREE IN GENERAL AND COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS COURSES IN PARTICULAR HAVE GIVEN ME MORE TOOLS AND KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ACTUAL DATA ANALYSIS AND WRITING CODES FOR PHYSICS SIMULATIONS

THESE DEGREES ARE ACTUALLY VERY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER IF YOU TAKE SOME INTRODUCTORY COURSES IN PHYSICS AND CS YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO TELL WHICH OF THEM YOU LIKE MORE FOR A DEGREE IN COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS YOU WILL NEED TO LIKE NORMAL PHYSICS AS WELL
DISCLAIMER CURRENT PHYSICS GRAD STUDENT AND I'VE ONLY TAKE AN UG COURSE IN COMP PHYSICS COMP PHYSICS IS ABOUT USING THE COMPUTER TO SOLVE PHYSICS PROBLEMS THAT WE CAN'T DO ANALYTICALLY SO YOU COULD THINK OF IT AS APPLIED COMPUTER SCIENCE CS IS GOING TO BE MORE ABOUT THE THEORY SIDE DEVELOPING THE TOOLS THAT PEOPLE USE OR AT LEAST THAT'S HOW IT WAS AT MY INSTITUTION YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF IF YOU LOVE PHYSICS SINCE THERE WILL BE MORE DOORS OPEN FOR THE CS DEGREE I WOULD SUGGEST DOING BOTH MAJORS IF YOU WANT TO PURSUE COMP PHYSICS
DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH YOU WANT TO DO PHYSICS

CS MAJORS IN GENERAL ARE USUALLY PRETTY UNDERPREPARED FOR PHYSICS THOUGH THEY CAN CONTRIBUTE TO SCIENTIFIC COMPUTATION PROJECTS IN AN ENGINEERING ROLE
IF THE BUBBLE UNIVERSES FORMED FROM ETERNAL INFLATION THEN THEIR SEPARATION WOULD BE INCREASING SO FAST THAT THEY COULD NEVER EVEN THEORETICALLY RUN INTO ONE ANOTHER IF HOWEVER WE ARE TALKING ABOUT OTHER UNIVERSES EMBEDDED IN A STABLE MANIFOLD LIKE THAT ENVISIONED FOR THE GRAVITON THEN COLLISIONS COULD TAKE PLACE I BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR PATTERNS IN THE POLARIZATION OF THE COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND CALCULATIONS OF THIS SORT ARE HIGHLY SPECULATIVE OF COURSE BUT I'M SURE THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WORKING ON IT IF YOU LIKE SPECULATION IN THIS AREA I SUGGEST THAT YOU READ LISA BOOK WARPED PASSAGES SOME THEORIES OF THE ORIGIN OF THE UNIVERSE THAT ATTEMPT TO GO BEYOND THE BIG BANG THEORY HAVE HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE ORIGIN OF OUR UNIVERSE WAS CAUSED BY THE COLLISION OF TWO BANES EACH CARRYING A UNIVERSE THE COLLISION WOULD IMPART ENERGY TO BOTH UNIVERSES ALLOWING THEM TO CREATE MATTER AND BEGIN EXPANDING NO ONE REALLY KNOWS IS PROBABLY THE CORRECT ANSWER BUT I BELIEVE THAT THESE SPECULATIONS ARE VERY IMPORTANT THERE ARE WAY TOO MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE WAY TOO EAGER TO DISMISS THESE CONCEPTS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BE FALSIFIED PHYSICISTS AND COSMOLOGISTS ARE JUST TOO GOOD AT COMING UP WITH NEW WAYS OF EXTRACTING MORE INFORMATION THAN YOU EVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE FROM THE DATA AT HAND
TO PIGGYBACK OF THE QUESTION WHAT DOES THESE BUBBLES FLOAT AROUND IN WHEN VISUALISER WE'RE USING OUR 3D SPACIAL DIMENSIONS BUT WOULDN'T THESE BUBBLES FLOAT AROUND IN OTHER DIMENSIONS NOT NECESSARILY LINKED TO THE ONES IN THE BUBBLES
I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER BUT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BANES AND BANE COSMOLOGY THE WIKI LINKS MIGHT PROVIDE SOME MORE INFO AND YOU CAN AT LEARN SEARCH GOOGLE FOR THE TERM BANE COSMOLOGY
FROM MY UNDERSTANDING THE BUBBLES ARE SEPARATED BY THAT IS DOMINATED BY A SINGLE THAT IS CONTINUALLY IN A STATE OF INFLATION THAT IS RAPIDLY EXPANDING FAR FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT IN THE SAME WAY THAT OUR UNIVERSE RAPIDLY EXPANDED DURING ITS FIRST MOMENTS THIS INFLATION OF THE CONTINUALLY CREATES NEW BUBBLE UNIVERSES WITH RANDOMIZED CONSTANTS BUT THE DISTANCE BETWEEN BUBBLES INCREASES SO RAPIDLY THAT NO COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THEM LET ALONE COLLISIONS IS IMPOSSIBLE
EH THE COLLISION DOESN'T MAKE SYNTACTIC SENSE TO ME THE BUBBLES IN AN AQUARIUM MODEL OF THE MULTIVERSE IS REALLY JUST A WAY OF EXPLAINING IT IN A THREE DIMENSIONAL MANNER


IT'S REALLY CLOSER TO INFINITE CHANNELS ON A TELEVISION SET THAT ARE IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER I GUESS THE CHANNELS SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO OVERLAP UNSURE OF WHETHER THE CONCEPT OF LEAVING ONE OF THE UNIVERSES MAKES ANY SENSE

ALSO THE UNIVERSES ARE NOT DEVELOPING IN THREE DIMENSIONAL SPACE SO THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF OVERLAP IS SHOT DOWN RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE

DID I ALREADY SAY THAT

IF THEY COLLIDED THEY'D HAVE TO OCCUPY THE SAME SPATIAL DIMENSIONS I GUESS AS THERE'S A LOT OF NOTHING IN OUR UNIVERSE THERE WOULDN'T BE TOO MANY EXPLOSIONS ANOTHER UNIVERSE COLLIDING WITH OURS IN OUR SPACETIME WOULD BE AFFECTED BY DARK ENERGY AND GRAVITY SO I GUESS COSMOLOGICAL EXPANSION WOULD BE ANOTHER REASON TO MINIMISE PHYSIC COLLISIONS MAYBE THEY'D PASS THROUGH EACH OTHER THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS ARE FUN
WOULDN'T THEY BE IMBEDDED WITHIN WITH INFLATIONARY MEDIUM THUS ONLY MOVING FURTHER FROM EACH OTHER

OR IS YOUR QUESTION ONLY HYPOTHETICAL IN THAT CASE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE DIFFERENT LAWS OF PHYSICS PER SAY LEVEL MULTIVERSE ONLY DIFFERENT CONSTANT VALUES THEY WOULD LIKELY SIMPLY MERGE NO
FIRST THIS IS PHILOSOPHY NOT SCIENCE BECAUSE THESE IDEAS AREN'T SUBJECT TO EMPIRICAL OBSERVATION OR FALSIFICATION

SECOND IF TWO BUBBLE UNIVERSES MERGED THEY WOULD BECOME ONE BUBBLE UNIVERSE THUS UNDERMINING THE IDEA OF MULTIPLE UNIVERSES

MOST PEOPLE WHO THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS IMAGINE THE BUBBLE UNIVERSES FLOATING IN WELL IN SPACE BUT UNIVERSES DON'T WORK THAT WAY EVEN IN THIS PHILOSOPHICAL SPECULATION UNIVERSES OF SPACE CAN'T FLOAT IN ANOTHER HIGHER SPACE CONTAINING THEM WITHOUT BEGGING THE QUESTION OF WHAT THAT HIGHER SPACE CONSISTS OF MAYBE THAT HIGHER SPACE CONTAINING THE BUBBLES IS THE REAL UNIVERSE AND THE BUBBLES ARE SORT OF LIKE PLANETS OR GALAXIES AT THAT LEVEL IF THIS RANK SPECULATION IS ACCURATE THEN THERE'S STILL JUST ONE UNIVERSE
I ACTUALLY AGREE WITH THIS THEORY SCIENTISTS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OUR UNIVERSE IS FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON MOVING VERY FAST IN A PARTICULAR DIRECTION THE ONLY PLAUSIBLE REASON IS THAT SOMETHING WITH GREATER OR EQUAL MASS EXISTS OUTSIDE OF OUR UNIVERSE AND IS CAUSING CHAOS WITH GRAVITY

LIKE MOST THINGS THAT WE DON'T QUITE YET UNDERSTAND THEY DUBBED THIS PHENOMENA DARK FLOW

EDIT STUPID IPHONE TYPO

POUNDS IS A UNIT A FORCE INDEPENDENT OF WHERE IT IS MEASURED A POUND OF FORCE IS THE SAME WHETHER IT IS ON THE EARTH THE SURFACE OF THE MOON OR IN THE DEPTHS ON INTERSTELLAR SPACE LIGHT YEARS FROM ANYTHING THE WEIGHT OF AN OBJECT OF A PARTICULAR MASS WILL BE A DIFFERENT NUMBER OF POUNDS DEPENDING ON THE LOCAL ACCELERATION DUE TO GRAVITY

AND ONE OTHER POINT
WE SAY POUNDS OF THRUST INSTEAD OF NEWTONS TO MAKE IT SIMPLER

UNTRUE POUNDS OR MORE PRECISELY IS USED TO MEASURE THRUST INSTEAD OF NEWTONS PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED STATES NOT BECAUSE IT IS SIMPLER BUT BECAUSE THE US STUBBORNLY REFUSES TO CONVERT TO SI UNITS USED BY OF THE REST OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION BOTH POUNDS AND NEWTONS ARE UNITS OF FORCE
THE WOMAN IN THE VIDEO IS VERY CONFUSED PRESUMABLY BECAUSE OF THE MAD USAGE OF POUNDS AS BOTH A MASS AND A FORCE IN FACT I THINK THEY'RE TECHNICALLY A UNIT OF FORCE WEIGHT THAT PEOPLE USE AS MASS COLLOQUIALLY INSTEAD OF THE OTHER WAY ROUND

A POUND-FORCE HERE IS A POUND-FORCE ANYWHERE IN THE UNIVERSE A LIKEWISE ON OTHER PLANETS THE CONVERSION RATE CHANGES FROM WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR THE CONFUSION EVEN ON EARTH IT'S NOT EXACTLY ONE-TO-ONE AS GRAVITY CHANGES LOCALLY DUE TO THE SHAPE OF THE EARTH AND CENTRIFUGAL EFFECTS

THE ROCKET ALWAYS OUTPUTS POUNDS OF FORCE BUT IF THE SPACECRAFT WEIGHED POUNDS ON EARTH IT WOULD WEIGH JUST ON THE MOON PERHAPS THAT IS WHAT SHE MEANS AND IN THAT CASE TH AS MUCH THRUST WOULD BE NEEDED TO LIFT THE SHIP OFF THE GROUND AGAINST THE WEAKER GRAVITY IN FACT GIVEN THE SAME THRUST AND THE SAME MASS YOU'D GET A LARGER ACCELERATION ON THE MOON DUE TO THE LOWER GRAVITY
EDIT LIKE MANY THIS POST PROVES THE EXISTENCE OF THE REDDIN EFFECT TO WIT THE MOST RELIABLE WAY TO BE DOWNVOTED IS TO POST UNCONTROVERSIAL FACTS

THE ENGINE HAD POUNDS OF THRUST THEREFORE AROUND NEWTONS OF FORCE THE FACT THAT THE GRAVITY IS LOWER DOESN'T AFFECT THE ENGINE'S THRUST THEREFORE THE THRUST IS STILL

ALL TRUE ONCE HAVING LEFT THE GROUND THE ENGINE PRODUCES SOME DESIGN THRUST WHICH PRODUCES A FORCE APPLIED TO THE CRAFT AND ITS OCCUPANTS THE RATE AT WHICH THE CRAFT ASCENDS FROM THE SURFACE RESULTS FROM THAT FORCE MINUS THE LOCAL GRAVITATIONAL FORCE SO IN A POWERFUL GRAVITATIONAL FIELD LIKE THAT ON EARTH THE CRAFT DOESN'T ASCEND AS QUICKLY AS IT WOULD ON THE MOON BUT THE FORCE EXPERIENCED BY THE OCCUPANTS IS GOVERNED ONLY BY THE ENGINE'S THRUST

TO SEE WHY IMAGINE THAT THE CRAFT IS IN UNTIL THE ENGINE STARTS ITS BURN IF WHEN THE ENGINE BEGINS TO APPLY ITS THRUST TO THE CRAFT THE CRAFT HAPPENS TO BE AT FEET AND POINTED TOWARD THE GROUND WILL THE OCCUPANTS FEEL THE ENGINE'S THRUST WILL THEY FEEL AN FORCE ACCORDING TO THIRD LAW YES IN FACT REGARDLESS OF WHICH WAY THE CRAFT IS POINTED STARTING THE ENGINE AT DESIGN THRUST WILL SUBJECT THE OCCUPANTS TO AN THRUST EQUAL TO THE ENGINE'S THRUST REGARDLESS OF THE LOCAL GRAVITATIONAL FIELD

IN THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE MOON STARTING THE ENGINE MAY LIFT THE CRAFT FROM THE SURFACE AGAINST THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE BUT ONCE THE CRAFT IS IN MOTION THE OCCUPANTS WILL FEEL THE SAME FORCE REGARDLESS OF THE LOCAL GRAVITATIONAL FIELD THEY WILL ONLY FEEL THE ENGINE'S THRUST BECAUSE TECHNICALLY THEY ARE IN

THE RATE OF ASCENT DEPENDS ON THE LOCAL GRAVITATIONAL FIELD BUT THE FORCE FELT BY THE OCCUPANTS DEPENDS ONLY ON THE ENGINE'S THRUST

ADD TO THAT THE ALIEN ENVIRONMENT OF THE MOON THE MOON ONLY HAS ABOUT ONE SIXTH THE AMOUNT OF GRAVITY THAT WE HAVE ON EARTH SO POUNDS OF THRUST COMING OUT OF THAT ENGINE WILL ACTUALLY FEEL LIKE LESS ON THE MOON

QUITE WRONG


IN THIS EXAMPLE I'LL ENGAGE IN THE POLITE FICTION THAT GRAVITATION IS A FORCE
LBF IS A UNIT OF FORCE IBM IS A UNIT OF MASSACHUSETTS BOTH ARE INDEPENDENT OF WHERE THEY ARE MEASURED HOWEVER SOMETHING WITH A MASS OF WEIGHS ON EARTH
THIS IS A LITTLE RANDOM AND NOT A WELL-POSED QUESTION BUT HERE GOES I HAVE A BS IN PHYSICS I'M MANY YEARS OUT OF SCHOOL NOW SWITCHED TO A FIELD I REMEMBER DURING UNDERGRAD LEARNING STUFF AT A MORE TECHNICAL LEVEL THAT I HAD READ ABOUT IN BOOKS AND BEING KINDA PISSED AT HOW MISLEADING THE WAS I MEAN SOME STUFF IS ALMOST LIES BUT OF COURSE GETTING A FORMAL EDUCATION TAUGHT ME THE TRUTH

I WAS CHATTING WITH A PHYSICS THE OTHER DAY AND HE SAID HE HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE IN UNDERGRAD GRAD SCHOOL AND SOMETIMES DURING HIS LIKE EVERYTHING I KNEW BEFORE WAS JUST DUMBED DOWN BS I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO GET DETAILS BUT THIS PIQUED MY CURIOSITY

HAVE OTHER PEOPLE HAD THAT EXPERIENCE CAN YOU GIVE A SPECIFIC CONCEPT THAT THIS APPLIED TO HE WAS A PARTICLE PHYSICIST SO MAYBE SOMETHING IN THAT AREA
IS THERE ANY WAY TO VISUALISER WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE IF OUTSIDE OF MY HOUSE WAS SUDDENLY RENDERED IN A HIGHER DIMENSION FOR EXAMPLE HOW WOULD TRAVELLING ALONG SAID DIMENSION ALTER THE VIEW

SORRY IF THIS IS MORE MATHEMATICS THAN PHYSICS BUT THE LINES OF BOTH SEEM TO BLUR AT MANY POINTS
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO WORD THIS BUT HERE GOES I'LL JUST RAMBLE AND FEEL FREE TO TOUCH ON WHAT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND TIME THERE ARE A FEW THINGS

IS THE PRESENT JUST A HUMAN CONSTRUCT IN MY VIEW OF THE WORLD THERE IS ONLY REALLY THE FUTURE AND THE PAST IF THE PRESENT TRULY EXISTS HOW LONG DOES IT LAST FOR AND IF THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME THE PRESENT EXISTS FOR CAN'T IT FURTHER BE SUBDIVIDED INTO PAST AND FUTURE SLICES THUS ELIMINATING AN ACTUAL PRESENT

2 CAN WE REALLY SPEAK ABOUT ANYTHING THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED DOES THIS EVEN MAKE SENSE FROM A PHYSICS STANDPOINT I AM SITTING HERE TYPING THIS RIGHT NOW AND I CAN THINK OF OTHER THINGS I MIGHT HAVE DONE AT THIS TIME BUT WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT WHAT IS THE POINT WHAT HAPPENED HAPPENED AND THAT WILL ALWAYS BE WHAT HAPPENED SO IN THIS CONTEXT

DO ALL EVENTS EXIST AT ONCE AND INSTEAD OF TIME ACTUALLY PASSING WE JUST EXPERIENCE TIME PASSING FOR SOME REASON LIKE THE FILM ON A MOVIE REEL ANALOGY THERE IS THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUAL PICTURES THAT EXIST ALL AT ONCE ON A MOVIE REEL BUT WE EXPERIENCE THEM AS A MOVING PICTURE OF TIME WHEN PLAYED THROUGH A PROJECTOR

FINALLY IS THE PASSAGE OF TIME RECEIVED DIFFERENTLY FOR DIFFERENT BEINGS AND IS THERE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE TIME CAN BE PERCEIVED DIFFERENTLY FOR DIFFERENT BEINGS


THANK YOU FOR ANY HELP YOU MAY OFFER
COULD AN ALCUBIERRE DRIVE BE USED TO ESCAPE THE EVENT HORIZON OF A BLACK HOLE
I RECENTLY HAD A CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE WHERE WE DISCUSSED WORMHOLES AND HE POINTED OUT TO ME THAT WORMHOLES AS WE CURRENTLY THINK OF THEM WOULD VIOLATE EITHER CAUSALITY OR RELATIVITY BECAUSE IF YOU PUT ONE END NEAR A STRONG GRAVITATIONAL FIELD THEY WOULD EITHER EXPERIENCE TIME AT DIFFERENT RATES ALLOWING YOU TO TRAVEL BACK IN TIME BY GOING THROUGH THE WORMHOLE OR THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE SOME UNIVERSAL TIME THAT ALLOWS THE WORMHOLE TO STAY SYNCED DESPITE THE TIME CHANGE WHICH GOES AGAINST RELATIVITY

IS THIS TRUE IF SO DO PHYSICISTS BELIEVE THAT THERE IS SOMETHING MISSING THAT COULD RECONCILE THIS PROBLEM OR ARE WORMHOLES IMPOSSIBLE
I THINK I'VE READ THAT ENTANGLEMENT WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD CAUSES THE PHENOMENON OR APPEARANCE OF WAVE FUNCTION COLLAPSE I KNOW THAT YOU CAN DO THE DOUBLE SLIT EXPERIMENT WITH ELECTRONS BUT SINCE THEY ARE CHARGED IN THEORY THE DIFFERENT ELECTRON PATHS WOULD HAVE DIFFERENT EFFECTS ON NEARBY CHARGES WHY DOESN'T THIS CAUSE COLLAPSE EVEN PHOTONS HAVE MASS AND THUS A SLIGHT GRAVITATIONAL PULL IS THIS MATTER CLARIFIED IN AFT THANKS
FOR ANYONE IN THE FIELD OF QUANTUM INFORMATION THEORY Q SHANNON THEORY COULD YOU RECOMMEND ANY POSSIBLE IDEAS FOR A BACHELOR THESIS MY LECTURER SPECIALISE IN STRONG CONVERSE BOUNDS BUT BECAUSE WE WANT TO HAVE A FINAL RESULT AT THE END OF THE YEAR WE BOTH FEEL THAT TACKLING THE PROBLEM DIRECTLY WOULD BE FAR TOO MUCH FOR AN UNDERGRAD

ANY HELP WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED
QUICK QUESTION DOES ANYONE KNOW OF ANY EXPERIMENT THAT SHOWS EVIDENCE THAT GRAVITY IS RELATED TO THE SPEED OF MOVEMENT OF A PARTICLE THROUGH SPACE RELATIVE TO ANOTHER PARTICLE

EXAMPLE A SPACE PROBE SENT INTO INTERSTELLAR SPACE BREAKS INTO THREE PARTS FOR AN EXPERIMENT ONE SENDING DENSE METAL BAR AT HIGH SPEED ONE MEASURING DEVICE TO MEASURE GRAVITY WAVES AS OBJECT PASSES AND ONE MORE SENDING DEVICE AT THE OTHER END TO SEND AN IDENTICAL DENSE METAL BAR BUT PASS AT MUCH SLOWER SPEED

THE IDEA IS THAT IN AN AREA OF SPACE WITH LESS GRAVITATIONAL INFLUENCE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO MEASURE SMALL GRAVITATIONAL FORCES USING A TINY LASER LIGHT AND MEASURING THE BEND OF THE BEAM AS THE DENSE BAR ZOOMS PAST IN CLOSE PROXIMITY THE EXPERIMENT WOULD THEN BE REPEATED BUT AT A MUCH SLOWER SPEED TO COMPARE AND GATHER DATA THAT MAY OR MAY NOT SHOW A CORRELATION BETWEEN THE MASSIVE OBJECTS SPEED THROUGH SPACE AND IT'S GRAVITATIONAL PULL THE SENSITIVE EXPERIMENT DOESN'T SEEM POSSIBLE ON EARTH OR IN ORBIT AROUND EARTH BECAUSE THERE IS STRONG GRAVITATIONAL INTERFERENCE FROM ALL OBJECTS WITHIN THE SOLAR SYSTEM

ANYONE AWARE OF A THEORY OR EXPERIMENT THAT TRIES TO TIE SPEED OF MOVEMENT THROUGH SPACE TO GRAVITATIONAL STRENGTH


I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACER FOR THIS QUESTION BUT HOW SOON SHOULD I START TO THINK ABOUT WHICH SPECIFIC FIELD OF PHYSICS I WANT TO GO INTO FRESHMAN YEAR GRAD SCHOOL ETC
HEY SO MY QUESTION IS MORE OF A PERSONAL ONE

SPARING YOU THE DETAILS I USED TO BE VERY GOOD AT MATH WHEN I WAS YOUNGER LEARNING HIGH SCHOOL ALGEBRA AND GEOMETRY IN MIDDLE SCHOOL BUT AS TIME PROGRESSES PAST THAT POINT I SOMEHOW FOUND MYSELF BEING ABSOLUTELY GARBAGE AT MATHEMATICS NOW GRANTED I NEVER REALLY APPLIED MY EFFORTS INTO THAT AS I WANTED TO STUDY MUSIC BUT NOW BEING FRESHLY GRADUATED FROM HIGHSCHOOL I FIND MYSELF REALLY WANTED TO STUDY THEORETICAL PHYSICS BECAUSE I WAS VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN THE FIELD AS A CHILD EARLY TEEN BUT I FEAR I MAY BE TOO FAR GONE TO CATCH UP FOR REFERENCE I ENDED UP TAKING ALGEBRA I TIMES II TWICE AND STAT ONCE ALL WITH D'S AND C'S

SORRY IF THIS HAS BEEN ASKED A THOUSAND TIMES BEFORE AND THANKS IN ADVANCE FOR THE ANSWERS
WHAT KIND OF EQUIPMENT DO NEED TO TEST SPECIFIC THEORIES OF QUANTUM GRAVITY HOW BIG AND EXPENSIVE WOULD IT BE
UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES DOES POLYGAMOUS ENTANGLEMENT HAPPEN IS ENTANGLEMENT NORMALLY ONLY BETWEEN TWO PARTICLES WHAT ABOUT CONDENSATES COULD THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE HAVE BEEN ENTANGLED AS A RESULT OF THE BIG BANG
HI GUYS I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT TIME DILATION AND THE SPEED OF PHOTONS


LET'S SAY THERE IS A STREAM OF PHOTONS COMING TOWARDS ME APPROACHING CLOSER AND CLOSER I AM ALSO SPEEDING TOWARDS THE INCOMING PHOTONS

WON'T TIME DILATION ACTUALLY MAKE THE PHOTONS ACCELERATE SINCE THEY ARE COVERING EVEN MORE DISTANCE IN LESS TIME
































I AM A PHYSICS UNDERGRAD CURRENTLY TAKING MY FIRST SEMESTER OF ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM BUT DID REALLY POORLY IN PHYSICS 2 WHERE MOST OF THE EMA STUFF WAS INTRODUCED I WAS HOPING TO GET A GOOD TEXTBOOK SUGGESTION THAT I CAN STUDY ON THE SIDE TO KEEP UP WITH THE EMA CLASS THAT DOESN'T ASSUME I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE MATERIAL ANY HELP AT ALL BE IT A TEXTBOOK SUGGESTION OR ADVICE IS APPRECIATED
THERE ISN'T A BEST SCIENCE DEGREE YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT WHAT THINGS YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IN A DEGREE DO YOU WANT TO HAVE FINANCIAL SECURITY MAYBE YOU DON'T CARE EVEN THE SLIGHTEST BIT ABOUT MONEY AND YOU JUST WANT TO DO RESEARCH HOW HARD ARE YOU PLANNING ON STUDYING FOR IT DIFFERENT DEGREES HAVE DIFFERENT STUDY METHODOLOGIES AND DIFFERENT DIFFICULTIES
I STUDY PHYSICS BECAUSE I LOVE IT AND I LOVE DOING IT FOR THE SAKE OF IT I CAN'T IMAGINE MYSELF WORKING IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND I WANT TO DO THE GREATEST POSSIBLE RESEARCH I CAN I AM PREPARED TO STUDY AS MUCH AS NECESSARY EVEN SACRIFICING OTHER THINGS IN MY LIFE I THINK YOU SHOULD TRY TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS AND THEN SEE WHAT FITS YOU BETTER SCIENCES ARE REALLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN EACH OTHER ONE MORE THING IS TO PICTURE YOURSELF IN THE FUTURE WITH ANY OF THESE DEGREES WHICH VISION SATISFIES YOU MORE FOR ME THIS WAS THE DECIDING FACTOR BETWEEN PHYSICS AND ENGINEERING GOOD LUCK
BEST SCIENCE DEGREE FOR JOB SECURITY IS AN ENGINEERING DEGREE

I WORK WITH A GOOD FEW PHYSICS MAJORS IN AEROSPACE BUT THEY'RE MORE LIKE JOBS WHICH REQUIRE SOMEONE CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING SCIENCE THAN TRUE SCIENCE JOBS
COMPUTER SCIENCE
BUT IN ALL SERIOUSNESS PM ME IF YOU HAVE ANY Q'S

I AM CURRENTLY A PHD STUDENT IN PHYSICS AND KNOW QUITE A FEW PEOPLE WHO RECENTLY DEFENDED AND ARE MOVING ELSEWHERE FOR JOBS POST DOCS ALSO KNOW QUITE A FEW PEOPLE FROM UNDERGRAD WHO WENT STRAIGHT TO WORK AND CAN TELL YOU HOW THEY DID IT
SERIOUSLY PICK THE SUBJECT YOU LOVE TO DO MOST A WITH ANY DEGREE IN SCIENCE IN EN ENGINEERING AREA THERE WILL ALWAYS BE WORK UNLESS YOU AGREE ON THAT HUMANS NEED NOT APPLY VIDEO ON YOUTUBE
MIGHT HELP FROM A SALARY STANDPOINT MOST SCIENCES NEED A PHD TO ACTUALLY DO SCIENCE THOUGH THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS
THIS ALSO REALLY DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU ARE IN THE WORLD I AM IN GERMANY AND I KNOW QUITE A FEW PEOPLE WITH PHS OR MSC DEGREES IN PHYSICS WHO ENDED UP EITHER GETTING A PHD IN THE INDUSTRY OR JUST WORKING THERE IN R D A LOT OF GERMAN TECH COMPANIES EMPLOY PHYSICS PHS AND THERE ARE ALSO CONSULTING FIRMS WHICH SPECIFICALLY TARGET THE SCIENTIFIC SECTOR

ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT DIFFERENT PHYSICS SECTORS WILL NOT BE EQUALLY RELEVANT TO CURRENT TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS

I WILL BE MOVING TO THE NETHERLANDS TO GET MY PHYSICS PHD THERE BUT MOSTLY BECAUSE I WANT TO DO EXCITING RESEARCH THE EXCITEMENT I GET FROM THIS IS REALLY MY MAIN MOTIVATION AS LONG AS I KNOW THAT I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MONEY

THERE ARE MANY OTHER QUALIFICATIONS YOU CAN HAVE EAST G PROGRAMMING SKILLS WHICH AREN'T NECESSARILY INCLUDED IN AN ACADEMIC DEGREE WHICH MIGHT QUALIFY YOU FOR MORE POSITIONS THAT AREN'T DIRECTLY PHYSICS RELATED I HOPE THIS HELPS YOU OUT A BIT IF NOT FEEL FREE TO ASK
THE NTH DEGREE
WITHIN EACH SCIENCE THERE ARE MANY SUBFIELDS AND IN PRACTICE CERTAIN SUBFIELDS ARE HARD TO ASSIGN TO ONE FIELD IN PARTICULAR MESOSCOPIC PHYSICS IS VERY CLOSE TO ELECTRONICS ENGINEERING OPTICS AND PHOTONIC ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY BRANCHES OF PHYSICS AND EE MANY FIELDS OF MATERIALS SCIENCE CHEMISTRY AND CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS HAVE A LARGE INTERSECTION AND ALSO TOUCH EE IN CERTAIN AREAS EAST G APPLIED MAGNETISM THEORETICAL PHYSICS MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE OVERLAP AND THEN THERE IS THE WHOLE FIELD OF MEDICAL PHYSICS AND ENGINEERING WHERE EE AND PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY TOUCH AT MRI WHILE NUCLEAR AND PARTICLE PHYSICS IS RELEVANT FOR PET

IT IS NOT AT ALL UNCOMMON FOR TRAINED PHYSICISTS TO END UP WORKING IN MATERIALS SCIENCE CHEMISTRY OR ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING EVEN WITHIN ACADEMIA OR FOR CHEMISTS TO WORK IN PHYSICS
JUST GO FOR WHATEVER YOU FEEL LIKE I CAN ONLY SPEAK OF ACADEMIA FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE BUT THERE ARE MANY SUBFIELDS WHERE DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES LIKE CHEMISTRY PHYSICS MATERIALS SCIENCE ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING MEDICAL ENGINEERING ALL COME TOGETHER

ESPECIALLY MATERIALS SCIENCE SEEMS LIKE A RANDOM MIXTURE OF SOLID STATE PHYSICS SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY AND SOME ENGINEERING ALL THROWN IN ONE FUNDING POT
PICK SOMETHING YOU ARE INTERESTED THE MOST IN THE ABSOLUTE WORST THING I CAN THINK OF IS HATING THE SUBJECT I'M TRYING TO GET A PHD IN I ORIGINALLY WANTED TO BE A DOCTOR SPECIFICALLY FOR MONEY AND FINANCIAL SECURITY BUT I REALIZED THAT WOULDN'T MAKE ME HAPPY AND I ACTUALLY JUST REALLY FUCKING LOVE PHYSICS AND NOW I'M WORKING ON MY UNDERGRAD IN PHYSICS AND I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
ENGINEERING I HAVE MY BS IN PHYSICS AND MY MASTERS IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING IT WAS A GREAT CHOICE THE STRONG FUNDAMENTALS FROM PHYSICS ACTUALLY GAVE ME AN EDGE IN MY ENGINEERING STUDIES AND NOW I WORK R D IN ENGINEERING THE BEST ADVICE I CAN GIVE THOUGH IS TO MIX IN AN ENGINEERING INTERNSHIP WITH SOME RESEARCH EXPERIENCE WHILE YOU CAN A GOOD COMBINATION OF EXPERIENCE IS REALLY HELPFUL
ARE YOU JUST STARTING COLLEGE
ITS BEEN HOURS CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN A BIT FOR THE LAZY LAYMEN
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE DIFFRACTION LIMIT IN OPTICAL MICROSCOPY
DEAR ALL THANKS FOR YOUR INTEREST IN OUR WORK IN SIMPLE TERMS WE DISCOVERED NEW OPTICAL METHODS THAT CAN MEASURE THE SEPARATION BETWEEN TWO STARS OR TWO FLUORESCENT PARTICLES THE PRINCIPLE IS THE SAME MUCH MORE ACCURATELY THAN PREVIOUSLY REALIZED

IT IS INDEED WELL KNOWN IN MODERN IMAGING RESEARCH THAT CRITERION IS HEURISTIC DIFFRACTION IS ONLY HALF OF THE PROBLEM AND NOISE PLAYS AN EQUALLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN DETERMINING THE ACCURACY OF ANY IMAGE PROCESSING METHOD FOR THE IMAGING OF STARS OR FLUORESCENT PARTICLES THE PHOTON SHOT NOISE DUE TO THE RANDOM ARRIVAL OF PHOTONS ON YOUR CAMERA DETECTOR HAS BECOME THE MAJOR NOISE SOURCE IN CURRENT TECHNOLOGY PREVIOUS RESEARCH SUCH AS HETP SHOWS THAT THE COMBINATION OF DIFFRACTION AND SHOT NOISE MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO STARS ACCURATELY AND THE ESTIMATION ERROR JUST SKYROCKETS WHEN CRITERION IS VIOLATED OUR WORK ON THE OTHER HAND SHOWS THAT CLEVERER OPTICAL TECHNIQUES CAN AVOID THIS SKYROCKETING ERROR AND ACHIEVE A MUCH HIGHER ACCURACY

INDEED OUR TECHNIQUES ARE RELATED TO THE SUPERRESOLUTION FLUORESCENT MICROSCOPY THAT WON THE CHEMISTRY NOBEL PRIZE IN BUT THOSE METHODS REQUIRE A WAY TO TURN THE FLUORESCENCE OF A SUBSET OF PARTICLES ON AND OFF TO AVOID VIOLATING CRITERION AND THE SKYROCKETING ERROR THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER OUR TECHNIQUES ON THE OTHER HAND WORK PURELY ON THE FAR OPTICAL FIELD AND CAN BE APPLIED NOT ONLY TO CLOSE FLUORESCENT PARTICLES BUT ALSO TO STARS

I CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH THE IMPORTANCE OF TAKING PHOTON SHOT NOISE INTO ACCOUNT IF YOU READ ERIC ORIGINAL PROPOSAL IN FOR EXAMPLE HE ALREADY RECOGNIZED THAT PHOTON SHOT NOISE IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR AND THE USE OF PROPER STATISTICS IS ARGUABLY WHY HIS METHOD WORKS AND WON HIM THE NOBEL PRIZE

YES YOU NEED TO KNOW THE CENTROID OF THE TWO SOURCES QUITE ACCURATELY TO ALIGN OUR PROPOSED DEVICES BUT IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE CENTROID IS A LOT EASIER TO MEASURE VIA DIRECT IMAGING THAN THE SEPARATION SO YOU JUST NEED TO SPLIT SOME OF THE PHOTONS FOR CENTROID MEASUREMENT FIRST BEFORE ALIGNING OUR DEVICE OUR PAPER HAS A MORE CAREFUL ANALYSIS OF THAT IN AN APPENDIX

AN INTUITIVE REASON FOR WHY QUANTUM INFORMATION THEORY IS RELEVANT IS BECAUSE WE NEED A RIGOROUS FORMALISM TO DEAL WITH BOTH THE WAVE NATURE OF LIGHT DIFFRACTION AND THE PARTICLE NATURE PHOTON SHOT NOISE AND TO STUDY HOW THIS COMBINATION AFFECTS OUR ESTIMATION ACCURACY

TO UNDERSTAND HOW OUR PROPOSALS WORK THE PAPER BY GROUP IS INDEED WELL WRITTEN AND A GOOD REFERENCE FOR MORE ACCESSIBLE SUMMARIES PLEASE SEE AND

IF YOU ARE A SCIENTIST AND HAVE A MORE TECHNICAL QUESTION IT IS MOST LIKELY ANSWERED ON THE FAQ WE MAINTAIN AT OR JUST READ THE PAPER WHICH IS OPEN ACCESS AND AVAILABLE AT HETP WE ARE WORKING HARD TO GENERALIZE OUR THEORY BEYOND TWO SOURCES FOR MORE GENERAL IMAGING APPLICATIONS BUT MOST LIKELY IT WON'T BE RELEVANT TO 3D DISPLAYS UNFORTUNATELY
THIS PAGE COULD SURE BENEFIT FROM SOME LOVE

WIKI
WOW THAT WAS AN EXCELLENT ARTICLE THE AUTHOR REALLY CONVEYS HIS SENSE OF EXCITEMENT WELL AND IS ENTERTAINING TO BOOT
I'M VERY IGNORANT ON THE SUBJECT BUT DOES THIS HAVE ANY APPLICATION TO 3D DISPLAYS
I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT RADIOASTRONOMY IS IT POSSIBLE THAT CURRENT RADIOASTRONOMY TECHNIQUES ALSO THROW AWAY INFORMATION MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT RADIOASTRONOMY CURRENTLY INVOLVES COMPUTING EITHER CORRELATIONS IN THE ELECTRIC FIELD AT DIFFERENT POINTS OR CORRELATIONS IN THE ELECTRIC FIELD SQUARED INTENSITY INTERFEROMETRY I BELIEVE THESE ARE CALLED RESPECTIVELY 2 AND POINT FUNCTIONS IN QUANTUM FIELD THEORY BUT IN PRINCIPLE WE COULD USE MORE OF THE STATISTICS DISTRIBUTION OF THE ELECTRIC FIELD AT N POINTS THAN JUST COMPUTE THESE CORRELATIONS
THIS WOULD SEEM TO REQUIRE THAT WE KNOW THE LINE OF CENTERS OF THE OBJECTS IN ADVANCE IS THIS TRUE IF SO HOW CAN WE FIND THAT LINE WHEN WE HAVE NOT YET RESOLVED THE STARS
PROBLEM WITH LIVING IN SUCH ENVIRONMENT HAS MORE TO DO WITH CHEMISTRY GOING ON IN HUMAN BODIES THAN IT HAS TO DO WITH PHYSICS

ONLY PHYSICAL RESTRICTION WOULD BE INCREASED DENSITY OF BREATHING GAS WHICH MAKES BREATHING MORE DIFFICULT

AT HIGH PRESSURE GASES WE BREATH DO SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THINGS TO OUR BODIES OXYGEN BECOMES TOXIC NITROGEN CAUSES NARCOSIS AND NEARLY EVERY OTHER GAS HAS SIMILAR EFFECT EXCEPTION IS HELIUM AND THAT'S WHY IT IS USED IN SCUBA DIVING

ALSO WITH INCREASED PRESSURE SOLUBILITY OF GASES IN LIQUIDS INCREASE SO WHEN ASCENDING DIVER MUST BE CAREFUL BECAUSE SUDDEN CHANGE OF PRESSURE CAN CAUSE DISSOLVED GAS TO EVAPORATE AND FORM BUBBLES ALL OVER THE BODY THAT IS CALLED DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS AND IT IS DANGEROUS BECAUSE BUBBLES CAN BLOCK BLOOD FLOW TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BODY AND WEAKEN BONE STRUCTURE IF THEY ARE FORMED INSIDE BONES

YOU GET THE IDEA PROBLEM WITH HIGH PRESSURE IS IN BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES WHICH ARE PRESSURE DEPENDENT
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE STRONG AND DURABLE UNLESS YOU'RE TRYING TO KEEP THE PRESSURE OUT IF YOUR BODY IS AT THE SAME PRESSURE IT DOES NOT EXERT ANY FORCE IN MUCH THE SAME WAY YOU DO NOT FEEL PSI BEARING DOWN ON YOU RIGHT NOW
AS STRONG AND DURABLE AS THESE


CHANGES IN PRESSURE EFFECT CHEMISTRY AND THEREFORE BIOLOGY THE CELL MEMBRANES OF ORGANISMS THAT LIVE AT DEPTH ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE MEMBRANES FROM CREATURES AT THE SURFACE ARE NO LONGER FLUID AND BECOME WAXY WITH HIGH PRESSURE
THE TRENCH IS METERS BELOW SEA LEVEL

TO A VERY GOOD APPROXIMATION THE PRESSURE GOES UP BY BAR FOR EVERY METERS THIS MEANS THAT THE PRESSURE YOU'RE LOOKING AT IS BAR THE HUMAN BODY IS MOSTLY MADE OF INCOMPRESSIBLE MATERIALS LIKE WATER AND BONE THE LITTLE POCKETS OF AIR THAT ARE COMPRESSIBLE WILL EQUILIBRATE WITH THE OUTSIDE PRESSURE IF YOU REGULARLY SWALLOW SO FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW YOU'RE GOOD YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET CRUSHED LIKE A CAN OF SODA BECAUSE UNLIKE THE CAN YOUR INSIDES WILL BE AT THE SAME PRESSURE AS THE OUTSIDE WORLD

HOWEVER THERE ARE A FEW PARTS OF THE HUMAN BODY THAT DON'T DEAL WITH PRESSURE SO WELL AND THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE IS THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AS YOU INCREASE THE PRESSURE DIFFERENT GASSES START TO INTERACT WEIRDLY WITH THE NERVOUS SYSTEM

FIRST YOU GET NITROGEN NARCOSIS BASICALLY THE NITROGEN IN THE AIR MAKING YOU DRUNK THEN OXYGEN BECOMES TOXIC THESE TWO PROBLEMS CAN BE STAVED OFF BY USING A BREATHING MIXTURE WITH VERY LOW AMOUNTS OF OXYGEN AND NO NITROGEN LIKE HELIO HELIUM OXYGEN

HOWEVER AS YOU START CROSSING THE BAR LINE METERS EVEN HELIUM STARTS TO CAUSE PROBLEMS VIA THE POORLY UNDERSTOOD HIGH PRESSURE NERVOUS SYNDROME YOU'LL GET TUNNEL VISION TREMORS NAUSEA AND YOU LOSE COORDINATIONS YOUR ABILITY TO THINK STRAIGHT IS AFFECTED AS WELL

THIS PROCESS CAN BE STAVED OFF FOR SOME TIME BY REPLACING MOST OF THE HELIUM IN YOUR BREATHING GAS WITH SOMETHING ELSE NITROGEN IS SOMETIMES USED BUT THAT LEADS TO NITROGEN NARCOSIS AS SEEN ABOVE AN ALTERNATIVE IS TO REPLACE SOME OF THE HELIUM WITH HYDROGEN FORMING HYDRELIOX USING HYDRELIOX WITH ABOUT HYDROGEN STAVES OFF THE POINT AT WHICH HIGH PRESSURE NERVOUS SYNDROME OCCURS BRINGING IT DOWN TO BARS METERS AND TESTS INDICATE THAT IT'S EFFECTS ARE NOT TOO SEVERE EVEN AT BARS METERS HOWEVER AT THAT POINT HYDROGEN STARTS TO MAKE YOU DRUNK AS WELL SO IT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT HUMANS ARE ABLE TO OPERATE AT PRESSURES EXCEEDING BAR NOTE THAT THIS IS STILL A FACTOR OF OFF FROM THE PRESSURE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE MARIANAS TRENCH
THIS IS FOR R BIOLOGY MORE THEN PHYSICS

ANYWAY FROM THE PHYSICS POINT OF VIEW WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PER CM SQUARE OF PRESSURE

ROUGHLY A TON PER CM ON YOUR BODY NO NEED TO SAY YOU MIGHT FEEL A BIT SQUASHY

WHY MOST OF THE ANIMALS AT SUCH DEPTH HAVE LITTLE BUT STURDY BONES OR ARE COMPLETELY MADE OF BONES OR BONELESS SOMEHOW IT'S ABOUT BONES MAH
WELL GIVEN THAT UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS THE BASE PSI AT SEA LEVEL IS THEN AFTER EVERY FOOT YOU ADDENDUM PSI YOU GET THIS

FEET DEEP PSI

SO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION YOU WOULD NEED TOM BE MADE OFF SOMETHING THAT COULD WITHSTAND THAT PRESSURE

I HAD REALLY GOOD CHEMISTRY AND MATHS TEACHERS IN SCHOOL SO I KNEW I WAS GOING TO END UP IN SCIENCE I TOOK BOTH PHYSICS AND CHEM CLASSES IN MY FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS OF COLLEGE AND DECIDED I PREFERRED PHYSICS SO STUCK WITH IT
IN SCHOOL I HAD A TERRIBLE PHYSICS TEACHER DURING THE FINAL YEARS SHE WAS SO BAD THAT I HAD TO DIG INTO THE BOOKS TO LEARN PHYSICS I REALISED HOW BEAUTIFULLY PHYSICS WOVE MATHS TO THE NATURAL WORLD UP UNTIL THEN I WAS HAD MULTIPLE CHOICES BUT SHE INADVERTENTLY MADE ME FOCUS ON PHYSICS NOW I'M AN UNDERGRAD THANKS TO HERALDRY

I AGREED WITH HER BECAUSE ALTHOUGH I FOUND HIGH SCHOOL PHYSICS INCREDIBLY DULL I HAD READ A LOT ABOUT RELATIVITY AND QUANTUM MECHANICS AND THAT SEEMED SO VAGUE THAT IT HAD TO BE FUN ALSO I WAS GOOD AT MATH BUT DOING ONLY MATHEMATICS SEEMED FAR TOO BORING ALTHOUGH NOW I REALIZE THAT HIGHER MATH IS REALLY INTERESTING AND I HAVE TAKEN QUITE A FEW ADDITIONAL MATH COURSES
SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF U CURIOSITY DEFINITELY PLAYED A PART BUT EGO DID AS WELL IF YOU WANT TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS OF THE AWE AND RESPECT YOU GET FROM PEOPLE AROUND DUE TO YOUR INTELLIGENCE YOU STUDY PHYSICS OR MATH I ALSO THINK THAT THIS KIND OF MOTIVATION UNDERLIES THE CHOICES OF PHYSICISTS MORE THAN THEY WOULD LIKE TO ADMIT

THIS IS CUTE FROM A PHYSICS POINT OF VIEW BUT IN REAL LIFE URBAN PLANNERS WILL TELL YOU THAT STREETS WITH SLOWER SPEED LIMITS ACTUALLY MOVE MORE CARS A TYPICAL CHART IS ON PAGE OF THIS REPORT HETP SO IN REALITY SPEED LIMITS DO AFFECT CAPACITY THEY JUST AFFECT IN THE OPPOSITE WAY THAT YOU'D THINK
TL R SECOND RULE MEANS CAR EVERY SECONDS MAXIMUM NO MATTER THE SPEED LIMIT
THE PRINCIPAL ASSUMPTION SECOND RULE IS DEAD WRONG FOR HEAVY TRAFFIC IN MY EXPERIENCE IT RAPIDLY GETS THROWN OUT THE WINDOW BY MOST PEOPLE

THAT REPORT LINKED TO BY U WARPZERO IS QUITE INTERESTING ACTUALLY IT ATTRIBUTES SLOWER STREETS CARRYING MORE TRAFFIC TO THE DECREASED DISTANCE TIME NEEDED BETWEEN YOU AND THE CAR IN FRONT BRAKING IS OF COURSE A LINEAR DECELERATION

SO I GUESS YOU COULD MODEL A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT SITUATIONS AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS
FOR EXAMPLE
AS IT IS NOW CONSTANT STOPPING TIME
2 DRIVERS LINEARLY INCREASE THEIR STOPPING TIME UP TO SECOND MAX
DRIVERS LINEARLY INCREASE THEIR STOPPING TIME WITH NO LIMIT YEAH LIKE THATS GOING TO HAPPEN
MAYBE YOU COULD FIND SOME DATA FROM REAL TRAFFIC AND PLAY WITH THAT

OF COURSE NONE OF THIS TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE OTHER DYNAMIC YOU SEE ON FREEWAYS WHICH I FEEL IS QUITE IMPORTANT IN HEAVY TRAFFIC WHICH IS THE OSCILLATING MOTIONS YOU GET WHERE WAVES OF MOVEMENT SEEM TO PROPAGATE DOWN LINES OF CARS
OBSERVATION IS ANALOGOUS TO INTERACTION ANY TIME A SYSTEM NEEDS TO KNOW SOME PROPERTY OF A PARTICLE POSITION MOMENTUM SPIN ETC TO DECIDE WHAT IT WILL DO IT IS AS IF THE PARTICLE HAS BEEN OBSERVED

NO ARCHITECT OF QUANTUM THEORY EVER IMPLIED THAT HUMANS OR BRAINS HAD ANY SPECIAL ROLE IN OBSERVATION OBSERVATION WAS ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD IN THE TECHNICAL CONTEXT OF MAKING A MEASUREMENT


THIS COMES UP REGULARLY IT'S PROBABLY THE OLDEST UNRESOLVED QUESTION IN QUANTUM MECHANICS

WIKI


IN QUANTUM THEORY OBSERVATION DOESN'T REQUIRE A HUMAN IT ONLY REQUIRES A SEQUENCE OF EVENTS THAT CAN COLLAPSE A WAVE FUNCTION A NEEDLE SWINGS A PEN MOVES ON A PIECE OF PAPER SOMETHING USUALLY MACROSCOPIC IN THIS DISCUSSION THE ROLE OF A HUMAN OBSERVER IS DEBATED BUT I THINK THE CONTROVERSY ABOUT A HUMAN OBSERVER IN QUANTUM OBSERVATION HAS BEEN RESOLVED NO HUMAN REQUIRED I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH SUBSTANCE TO THE ARGUMENT AFTER ALL IF A HUMAN IS REQUIRED TO OBSERVE QUANTUM PHENOMENA THEN HOW DID THE UNIVERSE EVOLVE TO THE POINT AT WHICH HUMANS BECAME AVAILABLE TO COLLAPSE WAVE FUNCTIONS
I THINK IN THE CONTEXT OF YOUR EXPERIMENT IT'S THE PHOTON USED TO RECORD WHICH SLIT THE ELECTRON WENT THROUGH
FEYNMAN WILL GIVE YOU A GOOD IDEA

READ SECTION AND THE FOLLOWING UP TO IF YOU'RE INCLINED

THIS KIND OF INTUITIVE EXPLANATION WILL NEVER GIVE YOU A COMPLETELY SATISFYING ANSWER HOWEVER IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO REALLY GRASP QM WITHOUT DIVING DEEP INTO THE MATHEMATICS
AN OBSERVATION IS A LARGE CLASSICAL SYSTEM THAT INTERACTS WITH ANOTHER OR IN OTHER TERMS A PERTURBING HAMILTONIAN WHICH CAUSES THE WAVEFUNCTION TO COLLAPSE THE COLLAPSE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAPPEN DUE TO THERMAL VARIATIONS IN THE LARGE SYSTEM WHICH TEND TO CANCEL OUT ALL OTHER STATES BUT ONE NOTE QUANTUM MECHANICS IS ALL ABOUT STATES OF A PARTICLE AND A SUPERPOSITION IS AS IF THE PARTICLE IS IN MORE STATES AT THE SAME TIME KIND OF AN OBSERVATION I EAST INTERACTION THEN CAUSES ALL THE EXTRA STATES TO GO AWAY AND THE PARTICLE CAN THEN ONLY BE IN A SINGLE STATE WAVEFUNCTION COLLAPSE

SO BASICALLY A TABLE STAYS IN THE SAME PLACE BECAUSE IT IS CONTINUOUSLY OBSERVING ITSELF
CONSCIOUS OBSERVATION AND PHYSICAL INTERACTION ARE ONLY CORRELATIONS TO THE COLLAPSE OF A WAVE FUNCTION BOTH ARE REQUIRED BUT NEITHER IS CAUSAL THE CAUSE IS SIMPLY WHETHER WHICH WAY INFORMATION EXISTS IN THIS UNIVERSE OR NOT IF WHICH WAY INFO CAN BE DEDUCED SOMEHOW BY THE SETUP OF THE EXPERIMENT THERE WILL BE NO INTERFERENCE IF THAT INFORMATION CANNOT BE DEDUCED THERE WILL BE INTERFERENCE
YOU SHOULD INCLUDE A LINK
I'M NOT EXACTLY PROUD OF THIS BUT IT FELT NECESSARY SOMEHOW

EDIT OP IS THE MAXIMUM YOUR SOFTWARE THE PAID VERSION CAN HANDLE I WOULD LOVE TO DO SOME STUFF NOT DICKBUTT I PROMISE
ALL YOU NEED IS A GOLD FOIL AN ALPHA SOURCE A VACUUM CHAMBER A COLLIMATOR AND A DETECTOR FOR THE SCATTERED ALPHAS LEGAL BUT IT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE
I AM INTERESTED IN GOLD FOIL EXPERIMENT AND AM WONDERING IT IT'S LEGAL AND SAFE TO RECREATE IT IN THE US

SMALL AMOUNTS OF RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL ARE COMMONPLACE AND QUITE SAFE IF HANDLED CAREFULLY FOR EXAMPLE SMOKE DETECTORS EACH HAVE A SMALL AMOUNT OF AMERICIUM AND THESE THINGS ARE EVERYWHERE

AS TO GOLD FOIL NOT MUCH IS REQUIRED TO SUPPORT SUCH AN EXPERIMENT AND IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE VERY THICK IN FACT IN SOME WAYS BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE EXPERIMENT THE THINNER THE BETTER REFERENCE GOLD LEAF

SO IN PRINCIPLE AND WITH PATIENCE ONE COULD REPRODUCE THE RUTHERFORD EXPERIMENT ON A SMALL BUDGET IN PRACTICAL TERMS USING A SMOKE DETECTOR AMERICIUM SOURCE IT WOULD BE A MATTER OF BEING WILLING TO WAIT FOR ENOUGH EVENTS TO CONSTRUCT A MEANINGFUL STATISTICAL RESULT
A COUPLE THINGS

WHEN A POSTER JUST DROPS A PAPER INTO R PHYSICS AND IT'S NOT A RECENT ONE WE ASK THAT YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT WHY YOU'RE POSTING IT DO YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC QUESTION DO YOU THINK THIS PAPER IS GREAT TERRIBLE WHAT SHOULD WE LOOK FOR WHY ARE YOU SHARING IT WITH US

2 QUANTUM FIELDS ARE NOT FIELDS COMMENT ON THERE ARE NO PARTICLES THERE ARE ONLY FIELDS EDIT SAME BUT WITH REPLY PDF THANKS U
I'D JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED IN DISCUSSION AROUND ART PAPER THAT THIS POST LINKS TO THERE ARE TWO EXISTING ARCHIVED R PHYSICS POSTS WITH A TOTAL OF COMMENTS AT

R PHYSICS COMMENTS

R PHYSICS COMMENTS

ALSO THERE IS THIS AT STACKEXCHANGE WHICH GETS INTO MORE TECHNICAL DETAILS SUCH AS SECOND QUANTIZATION

QUESTIONS

AND THIS

THESE MIGHT SERVE AS BACKGROUND IF ANYONE WANTS TO GET INTO FURTHER DISCUSSION

I HAVE NO COMMENTS ON PAPER OTHER THAN TO SAY THAT THE PHYSICS PROFESSORS I MOST RESPECT AND FOLLOW QUITE CLEARLY STATE THAT IT'S FIELDS THAT ARE FUNDAMENTAL NOT PARTICLES QUESTIONS LIKE THIS CAN QUICKLY DESCEND INTO PHILOSOPHICAL ISSUES OF ONTOLOGICAL REALISM ETC BUT AT LEAST FROM A PHYSICS THEORY AFT AND MATH VIEWPOINT IT SEEMS THERE IS A PLURALITY OF AGREEMENT ON THE FIELDS SIDE ISN'T THERE THOUGH OF COURSE SOME HAVE DIFFERENT EAST G PILOT WAVE THEORY OR PERHAPS EVEN MORE THOUGHTS

A WITH TWO MOUNTING BOLTS ON THE WALL AND A POINT FOR LOAD ATTACHMENT AT THE FARTHEST HORIZONTAL EXTENT IS RELATIVELY EASY TO ANALYZE ASSUMING THE LOWER OF THE TWO MOUNTING BOLTS IS THE PIVOT POINT AND THE UPPER GET PIVOTED BY THE LOAD THE UPPER BOLT WILL EXPERIENCE A REASONABLE PERCENTAGE OF THE WEIGHT

SOME OF THE WEIGHT WILL BE SHARED BETWEEN THE TOP AND BOTTOM BOLTS WITH A VERTICAL VECTOR AND SOME WILL BE EXPRESSED AS A ROTATION AROUND THE PIVOT POINT AND PULL HORIZONTALLY ON THE UPPER BOLT THE EXACT DETAILS WILL DEPEND ON THE SHAPE OF THE THE DIMENSIONS OF THE MOUNTING HARDWARE AND THE THICKNESS AND FLEXIBILITY OF THE SHEETROCK PLASTER

NEED I ADD THAT YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF USING A STUD FINDER AND ANCHORING THE BRACKET IN A WALL MEMBER INSTEAD OF DEPENDING ON THE STRENGTH OF THE SHEETROCK PLASTER IT'S BEEN MANY YEARS SINCE I RELIED ON SIMPLE PLASTER TO BEAR LOADS INSTEAD OF LOCATING A BEAM AND SINKING MORE SUBSTANTIAL HARDWARE INTO WOOD

AS IT HAPPENS I JUST SANK A HOOK INTO A BEAM IN THE ROOF OF MY LARGEST ROOM SO I CAN TEST TECHNICAL CLIMBING RIGS WITHOUT HAVING TO CLIMB A TREE IN MY YARD THE HOOK CAN EASILY BEAR MY WEIGHT 2 KILOGRAMS POUNDS AS I TEST SINGLE-LINE ASCENT RIGS

I OFTEN LIKE TO MENTION ONE OF MY PERSONAL HEROES EMMY NAETHER DESCRIBED BY EINSTEIN AND OTHERS AS THE MOST IMPORTANT WOMAN IN THE HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS AMONG SOME OF HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS

FIRST THEOREM WHICH IS A CORNERSTONE OF MODERN PHYSICS AND RELATES DIFFERENTIABLE SYMMETRIES OF THE PHYSICAL ACTION TO CONSERVED QUANTITIES AS I UNDERSTAND IT THIS DEVELOPMENT WAS A CONSEQUENCE OF HER WORKING TO SOLVE A PROBLEM IN GENERAL RELATIVITY THAT EINSTEIN COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHETHER HOW TO CONSERVE ENERGY IN GR AND HER SOLUTION NOT ONLY GAVE US ONE OF THE BEST TECHNICAL DEFINITIONS FOR ENERGY THAT WE HAVE BUT WAS SO GENERIC IT IMMEDIATELY APPLIED TO MANY OTHER CONSERVED QUANTITIES SUCH AS MOMENTUM
VARIOUS IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS OF ABSTRACT ALGEBRA AND RELATING IT TO OTHER AREAS OF MATHEMATICS THAT HER CONTEMPORARIES THOUGHT WERE LARGELY UNRELATED I'VE HEARD IT SAID THAT WITHOUT HER CONTRIBUTIONS HERE WE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP FIELD THEORY FAR ENOUGH TO GET THE STANDARD MODEL OF PARTICLE PHYSICS
SHE'S KNOWN FOR HER WORK BEING EXTREMELY GENERIC AND WIDELY APPLICABLE HER APPROACH TO SOLVING PROBLEMS CENTERING ON ELIMINATING ALL UNNECESSARY DEPENDENCIES AND FOCUSING ON ONLY THE MOST ESSENTIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND CONDITIONS

WHAT REALLY MAKES HER MY HERO THOUGH IS THAT SHE DID ALL OF THIS DESPITE BEING CONSTANTLY AFFRONTED BY BOTH SEXISM AND RACISM ALL THE WHILE BEING EXTREMELY HUMBLE AND MEASURED IN HER CONDUCT SHE WAS BORN INTO A JEWISH FAMILY IN GERMANY AND AT THE TIME WOMEN WERE NOT PERMITTED TO BE PROFESSORS SO AFTER SHE GRADUATED SHE WAS ONLY ALLOWED TO LECTURE AS AN ASSISTANT TO A PROFESSOR EVENTUALLY HOWEVER WITH ENOUGH OUTCRY FROM BOTH THE FACULTY AND THE STUDENT BODY SHE WAS ALLOWED TO HAVE THE TITLE OF PROFESSOR BUT WAS STILL NOT PAID FOR IT AFTER MORE TEACHING AND ACCOMPLISHMENT FINALLY SHE WAS GIVEN PAY BUT STILL DENIED TENURE EVENTUALLY AFTER ALL OF HER OUTSTANDING EFFORTS THEY FINALLY ALLOWED HER TO HAVE TENURE BUT THEN SHORTLY AFTERWARDS THE NAZI PARTY CAME INTO POWER AND SEEING HOW SHE WAS BOTH A WOMAN AND A JEW FIRED HER AND MANY OF HER ASSOCIATES PROMPTING OUTRAGE AND A NEAR RIOT BY HER FELLOW PROFESSORS AND HER LOYAL STUDENT FOLLOWING MANY OF WHOM THREATENED TO ABANDON THEIR EDUCATION UNLESS SHE WAS ALLOWED TO TEACH BUT IN THE MIDST OF THE TURMOIL SHE DIDN'T BAT AN EYE AND INSISTED THAT HER STUDENTS NOT BE DETERRED AND THAT THEY FINISH THEIR DEGREES AND NOT BE DISCOURAGED OR INCITED TO VIOLENCE SHE CONTINUED TO TEACH MANY OF THEM AFTER HOURS AND OUTSIDE THE UNIVERSITY'S CURRICULUM EVENTUALLY AS THE POLITICAL ARENA REACHED A PITCH SHE EMIGRATED TO THE US AND THERE IS A MEMORIAL DEDICATED TO HER IN MY VERY OWN HOME STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA WHICH I PLAN TO VISIT SOMEDAY BEFORE I DIE HAHA

ANYWAY I HOLD HER AS A SOURCE OF INSPIRATION NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF HER MATHEMATICAL BRILLIANCE BUT THE COMBINATION WITH HER GREAT HUMILITY AND PERSEVERANCE AGAINST THE BIGOTRIES OF HER TIME THE WAY I SEE IT SHE HAD ALL OF THE QUALITIES BEFITTING A HERO BUT WAS A REAL ACTUAL PERSON AND NOT JUST A COMIC BOOK CHARACTER SHE MIGHT BE ARGUABLY RIVALLED IN MATHEMATICS BY THE LIKES OF SAY EULER GAUSS EINSTEIN NEWTON AND OTHERS BUT I FEEL THAT HER CHARACTER EXTENDS BEYOND JUST HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND REALLY MAKES HER STAND OUT AMONG THEM

HAVE YOU WATCHED THE VIDEOS ABOUT MEASURING REFRACTIVE INDEX ON YOUTUBE THAT MIGHT BE MUCH BETTER THAN A TEXT EXPLANATION


DOES THE CELL THAT HOLDS THE WATER NOT IMPACT THE RI

YES IT DOES BECAUSE THE RI OF GLASS IS ROUGHLY BUT FOR WATER IT'S BUT THIS EFFECT ISN'T USUALLY IMPORTANT HERE'S AN EXAMPLE



IN THE ABOVE IMAGE CREATED USING OPTICALRAYTRACER THE GLASS CELL WALLS WITH AN RI OF ARE RELATIVELY THIN COMPARED TO THE WATER VOLUME WITH AN RI OF SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THE OVERALL REFRACTION EFFECT IS DOMINATED BY THE WATER SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE'S MORE OF IT

WHY DOES THE CELL NEED TO BE RECTANGULAR COULD IT BE A BEAKER

HERE'S WHY YOU WOULD WANT TO AVOID A BEAKER ALSO GENERATED USING OPTICALRAYTRACER



THAT LOOKS LIKE IT WOULD BE VERY CONFUSING TO SORT OUT A PARTICULAR REFRACTIVE INDEX YOU'RE BETTER OFF SETTING UP WITH A RECTILINEAR VESSEL

DOES THE DISTANCE OF THE LASER POINTER FROM THE CELL MATTER

NUMBER SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS WILL ANSWER THEMSELVES WHEN YOU START EXPERIMENTING


DOES THE DEPTH OF THE WATER MATTER

NOT FOR THE REFRACTION ALL OF WHICH HAPPENS AT THE TRANSITIONS BETWEEN MEDIA BUT WHEN YOU START TAKING MEASUREMENTS KNOWING THE DIMENSIONS OF YOUR VESSEL MAY HELP YOU MAKE THE REQUIRED MEASUREMENTS

MAYBE IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR YOU TO START BY PLANNING YOUR EXPERIMENT WITH MY FREE PROGRAM OPTICALRAYTRACER AND AFTER YOU HAVE SOME IDEA WHAT THE PROBLEMS WILL BE YOU CAN START IN THE LABORATORY

AUTHOR MAKES NOTE OF ONE THE BIG PROBLEMS IN FUSION POWER RESEARCH TOKAMAKS LIKE ITER MUST BE HUGE AND COMPLICATED WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS THEY MUST ALSO BE EXPENSIVE GOING ALL-IN ON ITER MEANS THERE'S NO MONEY LEFT TO FUND ALTERNATIVE BUT ULTIMATELY MORE PLAUSIBLE APPROACHES OR EVEN OTHER TOKAMAKS OF WHICH THERE ARE AT LEAST A SMALL HANDFUL

I'M EXCITED ABOUT EAST AIF JET EMC 2 TRI ALPHA GENERAL FUSION

MY FAVORITE DARK HORSE HERE IS LAWRENCEVILLE PLASMA PHYSICS DENSE PLASMA FOCUS STUFF
THE GRAPH REMAINS JUST SILLY I MEAN HOW COULD THEY LOOK FORWARD YEARS AND SAY RIGHT WE'LL NEED THOSE WIGGLES IN FUNDING THEN BUT IT IS JUST A SMALL SILLY THING

I DO WONDER IF PLASMA IS ACTUALLY UNDERSTOOD WELL ENOUGH SO YOU CAN SAY BUILD SO AND SO IT'LL WORK REMEMBER RECENTLY SOMETHING NEW BEING UNDERSTOOD ABOUT TURBULENCE OF ELECTRONS ALSO MATTERING WE'RE IN TURBULENCE REGIME IN PARTS OF THE PLASMA THAT IS NOT ENTIRELY UNDERSTOOD I MEAN IF YOU CAN MODEL THINGS WELL IN WIDE REGIMES YOU CAN SAY THAT IT WILL WORK AND THEN I THINK THAT INDEED LOTS OF MONEY SHOULD BE THROWN AT IT AND WELL MANAGED
THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD READ THANKS
I WONDER HOW THIS COMPARES WITH SOLAR POWER I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE HEAVILY INVESTED IN FUSION BUT HOW DOES AN UNBIASED ECONOMICAL COMPARISON OF A FUSION VS SOLAR GO I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE TEND TO FORGET THAT SOLAR POWER IS ALSO VIRTUALLY FREE UNLIMITED ENERGY THAT YOU ONLY HAVE TO BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE IT'S NOT CHEAPER THAN FOSSIL FUELS CURRENTLY IT IS IN SOME PLACES THO BUT IT'S WELL WITHIN AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE AND HOLDS GREAT PROMISE

SOME NUMBERS FROM VERY ROUGH GOOGLING W BILLION WOULD ACTUALLY GIVE GW OF POWER MUCH MORE THAN THE PROVIDED ESTIMATE USING SOME CURRENT LOW SCALE ACTUAL COMMERCIAL DATA IMAGINE WHAT WE CAN DO IN A FEW YEARS WITH MASSIVE MORE ADVANCED PANELS PROBABLY W OR LESS IF YOU CARE ABOUT THE STORAGE PROBLEM W SHOULD HAVE YOU COVERED WITH ROOM TO SPARE

SO I THINK FUSION IS ONLY GOING TO BE REQUIRED MUCH FURTHER IN OUR CIVILIZATION TECH TREE PRETTY MUCH WHEN MOST OF EARTH IS COVERED IN SOLAR PANELS

I MEAN IT'S PRETTY HARD TO BEAT THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE OF A KG FUSION REACTOR WE HAVE OVER OUR HEADS SO I THINK THE CURRENT FUNDING IS MORE THAN ADEQUATE AND ITER A WHITE ELEPHANT CONVINCE ME OTHERWISE IF I'M WRONG PLEASE
YOU ARE WORKING ON THE CART WHILE THE HORSE HAS YET TO BE DOMESTICATED
NUCLEAR FUSION H TO HE IS THE POWER OF THE FUTURE WAS IS AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE FOR A VERY LONG TIME TO COME INSTEAD OF HOPING FOR SOMETHING TOMORROW WE NEED TO GET ON WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF WIND TURBINES AND SOLAR PANELS ON A MASSIVE GLOBAL SCALE PLUS SUPER INSULATION OF BUILDINGS AND BASED TRANSPORTATION

WHY USE AN ENGINEERING PROBLEM LIKE A MISSION TO THE MOON


THAT LOOKS PRETTY NORMAL THOUGH ONCE YOU GET INTO YOUR UPPER DIVISION CLASSES YOU WILL TAKE THE SAME NAME AS THOSE CLASSES BUT MUCH MORE IN DEPTH
SO DOES ANYONE HAVE THE LESSON PLANS FOR A CLASS LIKE THIS OR THE SYLLABUS CURRICULUM
CURRENTLY IN HIGHSCHOOL BUT WILL TAKE PHYSICS AT A LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE FROM THE SYLLABUS THAT I WAS GIVEN YOUR CLASS LOOKS SIMILAR TO MINE
HEY I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF EFREMOV STATES BUT JUST WANT TO SAY THAT PHOTONS DO INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER IN QED VIA HIGHER ORDER FEYNMAN DIAGRAMS DEPENDING ON HE ENERGIES OF THE PHOTONS THIS MIGHT BE MUCH LARGER THAN GRAVITATIONAL INTERACTIONS
IN ANY REASONABLE EXPERIMENTAL SITUATION PHOTONS DON'T INTERACT A SETUP IN WHICH TEMPERATURE IS HIGH ENOUGH THAT INTERACTIONS ARE SIGNIFICANT AND SIMULTANEOUSLY THE SYSTEM REMAINS FULLY QUANTUM IS PROBABLY NOT POSSIBLE OR AT LEAST RIDICULOUSLY HARD

BTW THE STRONGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO FOR MOST CENTRE OF MASS ENERGIES IS THAT COMING FROM THE BOX DIAGRAM IN QED MEDIATED BY A VIRTUAL ELECTRON GOING IN A LOOP AND THAT IS REALLY REALLY SMALL IF THE ENERGY IS SMALLER THAN 2 AND IT DOESN'T GROW VERY FAST WITH ENERGIES ABOVE THAT
THE IMPORTANT THING THAT MAKES PHOTONS DIFFERENT FROM MASSIVE BOSONS LIKE EAST G COLD ATOMS USED TO OBSERVE EFREMOV STATES IS THAT PHOTON NUMBER IS NOT CONSERVED

SO IF YOU HAVE A PHOTON GAS IN EQUILIBRIUM WITH NONZERO NUMBER DENSITY IT ALSO HAS A PRETTY HIGH ENERGY DENSITY AS YOU TRY TO COOL YOUR PHOTON GAS DOWN SO THAT THERMAL FLUCTUATIONS AREN'T DESTROYING YOUR VERY SMALL BINDING ENERGY EFREMOV TRIMERS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS THE PHOTONS JUST GO AWAY THIS IS THE SAME REASON THAT ONE CAN'T MAKE AN EQUILIBRIUM BEC OUT OF PHOTONS
THE SPEED OF LIGHT IN RELATIVITY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH LIGHT SPECIFICALLY IT'S A BASIC FEATURE OF SPACE AND TIME THAT THERE IS A MAXIMUM SPEED THAT APPLIES TO ALL INFORMATION IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT A MASSLESS PARTICLE LIKE LIGHT MUST ALWAYS TRAVEL AT THE MAXIMUM SPEED AND LIGHT WAS THE FIRST MASSLESS PARTICLE DISCOVERED THOUGH WE DIDN'T THINK IN THOSE TERMS THEN

HELLO ADEEBCHOWDHURY NOT A SILLY QUESTION AT ALL

YOUR WAY TO THINK OF IT DOES NOT REFLECT THE LAW LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION OR MORE PRECISELY THE FORMULA ALTHOUGH IT IS A WAY TO THINK OF IT THAT WORKS

A MORE ACCURATE WAY TO THINK OF IT IS THIS WANT TO KNOW AT WHAT SPEED DOES SOMETHING MOVE MEASURE IT WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH TIME DOES IT TAKE TO SOMETHING TO HAPPEN MEASURE IT THE PROBLEM ARISES WHEN YOU WANT TO KNOW AT WHAT SPEED IS THAT THING MOVING FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THAT PLANET OR THAT STAR OR THAT ROCKET THAT'S WHAT THE LAW IT'S FOR TO KNOW HOW THINGS LOOK FROM OTHERS POINT OF VIEW REFERENCE SYSTEM WHAT I WANT TO POINT OUT WITH THIS IS THAT THERE ISN'T A SPEED THERE ARE JUST POINTS OF VIEW FOR WE DONT KNOW WHICH POINT OF VIEW IS THE GOOD ONE MAYBE COSMIC BACKGROUND RADIATION BUT THAT IS NOT THE GOOD ONE IS JUST A VERY GOOD ONE

END OF THE STORY WE KNOW THE LAW TO KNOW HOW THINGS MOVE FROM OTHERS POINTS OF VIEW TURNS OUT THAT THE HIGHER THE SPEED OF SOMETHING IS FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE THE LESS IT WILL CHANGE ITS SPEED WHEN YOU CHANGE THE PERSPECTIVE THE EXTREME CASE BEING THINGS THAT MOVE AT SPEED C WHICH DO NOT CHANGE THEIR SPEED AT ALL IN OTHER WORDS IF SOMETHING IS MOVING SLOWLY TO YOU IT MAY BE MOVING REALLY FAST FOR ANOTHER PERSON MOVING FAST RELATIVE TO YOU BUT IF SOMETHING IS MOVING AT A SPEED NEAR THE SPEED OF LIGHT FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE NO MATTER AT WHAT SPEED THE OTHER OBSERVER IS MOVING HE WILL SEE THAT SAME THING MOVING NEAR THE SPEED OF LIGHT ALTHOUGH THE EXACT VALUE MAY CHANGE LITTLE

THIS EFFECTS HAPPENS TO EVERYTHING IT'S JUST THAT MASSLESS PARTICLES AKA PHOTONS TRAVEL AT SPEED C ALWAYS WHEREAS OTHER BOSONS WITH MASS CAN BE FOUND MOVING AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS

AS FOR THE FINAL QUESTION SPECIAL RELATIVITY CONSISTS OF TWO POSTULATES THINGS THAT WE KNOW THAT MUST BE ALWAYS TRUE AND THE REST OF IT IS MATH DEVELOPED TO CALCULATE THINGS IN ORDER THAT THIS POSTULATES ALWAYS HOLD THIS TWO POSTULATES ARE

THE LAWS OF PHYSICS ARE THE SAME IN ALL INERTIAL SYSTEMS FRAMES OF REFERENCE

2 THE SPEED OF LIGHT IN A VACUUM IS THE SAME FOR ALL OBSERVERS REGARDLESS OF THE MOTION OF THE LIGHT SOURCE

SO NO THE FORCES IN NATURE ARE THE SAME FOR EVERYBODY OR THAT IS WHAT WE THINK AND SPECIAL RELATIVITY IS A SYSTEM TO CALCULATE THINGS IN ORDER THAT THAT ASSERTION IS TRUE

HOPE THAT HELPS
I'M A PHYSICS DEGREE STUDENT 4TH YEAR
JUST A COUPLE THINGS TO CLARIFY THAT MIGHT AIDE YOUR UNDERSTANDING

AS AN OBSERVER GAINS A HIGHER VELOCITY THE SPEED OF LIGHT RELATIVE TO THE OBSERVER DECREASES THUS TO MAINTAIN THE CONSTANCY OF THE SPEED OF LIGHT THE FLOW OF TIME SHORTENS FOR THE OBSERVER THE LENGTH OF A SECOND INCREASES SO THAT LIGHT CAN COVER THE SAME DISTANCE IN A SECOND RELATIVE TO THE OBSERVER AS IT DOES RELATIVE TO AN OBSERVER AT RELATIVE REST

THE SPEED OF LIGHT IS CONSTANT FOR ALL OBSERVERS INDEPENDENT OF RELATIVE VELOCITY AS MANY OTHERS HAVE POINTED OUT LIGHT IS NOT SPECIAL ANY MASSLESS PARTICLE WOULD TRAVEL AT THE SAME SPEED THROUGH VACUUM THE SPEED OF LIGHT IS MORE ACCURATELY NAMED THE SPEED OF CAUSALITY OR THE MAXIMUM SPEED AT WHICH INFORMATION CAN PROPAGATE THROUGH SPACE THE ASSUMPTION THAT OBSERVERS MEASURE THE SPEED OF LIGHT TO BE C IN VACUUM REGARDLESS OF VELOCITY IS IN SOME SENSE EQUIVALENT TO SAYING THAT CAUSALITY MUST PROPAGATE WITH THE SAME MAXIMUM SPEED THE LAWS OF THE UNIVERSE MUST MOVE FORWARD IN TIME WITH THE SAME RATE REGARDLESS OF RELATIVE VELOCITY TIME DOES NOT SLOW ITSELF DOWN TO MAKE THIS AXIOM TRUE IT IS THE OTHER WAY AROUND TIME DILATION AND LENGTH CONTRACTION ARE NECESSARY BYPRODUCTS OF THIS ASSUMPTION ON OUR MODELS OF REALITY

YOU SHOULD ALSO BE CAREFUL ABOUT HOW YOU DESCRIBE THE EFFECTS OF LENGTH CONTRACTION AND TIME DILATION THESE PHENOMENA OCCUR RELATIVE TO AN OBSERVER AT REST ALL MOTION IS RELATIVE IF I MEASURE YOU MOVING WITH RESPECT TO ME THEN I WILL OBSERVE YOUR CLOCK TICKING SLOWER THAN MINE DOES AND I WILL OBSERVE LENGTHS IN YOUR DIRECTION OF MOTION TO BE CONTRACTED HOWEVER FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE THOSE THINGS WOULD BE TRUE FOR ME AS I WOULD BE THE ONE MOVING RELATIVE TO YOU

ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT ALL OF THIS LENGTH CONTRACTION TIME DILATION ETC APPLIES TO RELATIVE MOTION AT CONSTANT VELOCITY AS SOON AS YOU STEP OUT OF THAT FRAMEWORK AND SAY START TO INCORPORATE ACCELERATION OR VARIOUS FORMS OF ENERGY AND RADIATION YOU'RE IN THE REALM OF GENERAL RELATIVITY AND POSSIBLY CD AND AFT NOTHING IS AS SIMPLE BUT IT'S NO LESS BEAUTIFUL AND MYSTIFYING
IT'S NOT REALLY THAT TIME SLOWS DOWN TIME ISN'T SOME FIXED THING IN THE BACKGROUND IN WHICH EVERYTHING IS IMMERSED TIME INTERVALS ARE PROPERTIES RELATING EVENTS IN SPACETIME AND HOW LONG A TIME INTERVAL IS DEPENDS ON YOUR FRAME OF REFERENCE

YOU CAN MAKE AN ANALOGY TO SPATIAL COORDINATES SAY YOU'RE FACING YOUR COMPUTER WHICH IS ABOUT A FOOT IN FRONT OF YOU IF YOU TURN DEGREES TO YOUR LEFT YOUR COMPUTER IS NO LONGER A FOOT IN FRONT OF YOU IT'S ABOUT FEET IN FRONT OF YOU AND FEET TO YOUR RIGHT THE TOTAL DISTANCE FROM YOU TO THE COMPUTER IS STILL ONE FOOT BUT THE WAY ITS DISPLACEMENT RESOLVES INTO COMPONENTS HAS CHANGED

EVENTS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY WHERE THEY OCCUR IN SPACE AND WHEN THEY OCCUR IN TIME AN LED LIGHT ON YOUR COMPUTER MIGHT BLINK AT INTERVALS OF ONE SECOND IF YOU'RE SITTING STILL RELATIVE TO YOUR COMPUTER THESE BLINKS ALL OCCUR AT THE SAME PLACE IN SPACE HOWEVER IF YOU BOOST YOURSELF TO ABOUT OF THE SPEED OF LIGHT RELATIVE TO YOUR COMPUTER THEN THESE BLINKS ALL OCCUR A DISTANCE OF ABOUT METERS APART ADDITIONALLY THE BLINKS WILL OCCUR FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE ABOUT SECONDS APART

THIS ISN'T BECAUSE TIME HAS SLOWED DOWN FOR YOUR COMPUTER SOMEONE STILL SITTING STILL RELATIVE TO YOUR COMPUTER WOULD SEE THINGS YOU DO AS DILATED IN TIME AS WELL TIME DILATION IS A MATTER OF PERSPECTIVE HOW DISPLACEMENT IN SPACETIME RESOLVES INTO TIME DIFFERENCES AND SPATIAL DISPLACEMENTS IT'S NOT THAT THERE'S SOME BACKGROUND PROCESS CALLED TIME THAT SPEEDS UP OR SLOWS DOWN

ALSO THERE ARE QUANTITIES THAT REMAIN THE SAME WHEN YOU SWITCH BETWEEN REFERENCE FRAMES THE SPEED OF LIGHT IS ONE OF THESE
SO AS OTHERS HAVE MENTIONED THE COSMIC SPEED LIMIT HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH LIGHT AND MORE TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT IT'S MASSLESS ANY MASSLESS PARTICLE WITH HAVE THE SAME PROPERTIES

IN FACT THE SAME THING DOES HAPPEN FOR OTHER MASSLESS PARTICLES LIKE GLUONS AND GRAVITONS W Z BOSONS DO HAVE MASS AND SO THEY DO NOT EXPERIENCE EXACTLY THE SAME THING

ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE PERSON MOVING FAST DOES NOT EXPERIENCE THEIR TIME AS TICKING AWAY SLOWLY NEITHER CAN THEY OBJECTIVELY CHECK THAT THEIR TIME IS TICKING AWAY SLOWLY TO THEM ALL IS WELL AND THE SPEED OF LIGHT THE COSMIC SPEED LIMIT IS STILL THE SAME

THE DISCREPANCY BECOMES APPARENT WHEN A STATIONARY OBSERVER TRIES TO CALCULATE HOW FAST THE CLOCK OF THE MOVING PERSON IS TICKING AWAY OR IF THE STATIONARY OBSERVER TRIES TO CALCULATE DISTANCES AS SEEN BY THE MOVING PERSON

TO ANSWER YOUR LAST QUESTION NO THE CHANGING OF THE RATE OF CLOCK TICKS IS NOT BECAUSE OF THE EFFECT THAT THIS HAS ON THE FORCE CARRIERS THE MAIN WAY THAT YOU CAN SEE THIS IS TO CONSIDER TWO OBSERVERS MOVING WITH RESPECT TO EACH OTHER IN THIS CASE EACH OBSERVERS WOULD JUDGE THE FORCE CARRIERS OF THE OTHER ARE MOVING MORE SLOWLY THIS CLEARLY CAN'T BE TRUE

THE TRUE REASON FOR THESE EFFECTS HAS TO DO WITH THE WAY THAT THE GEOMETRY OF SPACE AND TIME IS SETUP TO RESPECT A COSMIC SPEED LIMIT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT IS OCCUPYING THE SPACE OR INDEED IF ANYTHING IS OCCUPYING THE SPACE AT ALL SPACE AND TIME STILL BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY IN DIFFERENT FRAMES OF REFERENCE

FRAMES OF REFERENCE BEING STATES OF MOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE WITH CONSTANT SPEED EACH OF THESE FRAMES MEASURES TIME AND SPACE ELEMENTS ALONG THEIR DIRECTION OF MOTION DIFFERENTLY FROM OTHER FRAMES OF REFERENCE

I HOPE THIS CLARIFIES THINGS
AS AN OBSERVER GAINS A HIGHER VELOCITY THE SPEED OF LIGHT RELATIVE TO THE OBSERVER DECREASES

NUMBER I GET WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY FROM YOUR NEXT SENTENCE THE SPEED OF LIGHT WOULD DECREASE BUT SINCE IT CAN'T THE FLOW OF TIME BUT EVEN SO THIS IS AN INCORRECT STATEMENT IF LIGHT WAS NOT A CONSTANT SPEED SPEEDING UP DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THE SPEED OF ALL PHOTONS WOULD DECREASE RELATIVE TO THE TRAVELER FOR EXAMPLE LIGHT TRAVELLING TOWARDS HIM WOULD THEORETICALLY SPEED UP

THUS TO MAINTAIN THE CONSTANCY OF THE SPEED OF LIGHT THE FLOW OF TIME SHORTENS FOR THE OBSERVER THE LENGTH OF A SECOND INCREASES SO THAT LIGHT CAN COVER THE SAME DISTANCE IN A SECOND RELATIVE TO THE OBSERVER AS IT DOES RELATIVE TO AN OBSERVER AT RELATIVE REST

ACTUALLY TIME SLOWS DOWN FOR BOTH THE TRAVELER AND THE OBSERVER THE OBSERVER THINKS THE CLOCK IN THE SHIP IS RUNNING SLOW THE TRAVELER IN THE SHIP THINKS THE CLOCK ON THE PLANET IS RUNNING SLOW THIS GETS RAPIDLY CORRECTED WHEN EITHER PARTY ACCELERATES OR DECELERATES

THE SAME THING DOES NOT OCCUR FOR OTHER W Z BOSONS GRAVITONS ETC DOES IT DOES THAT MEAN THAT UNLIKE PHOTONS THE SPEED OF THESE BOSONS ACTUALLY DOES DECREASE RELATIVE TO YOU

ALL THINGS EXPERIENCE TIME DILATION EVEN PHOTONS THE DISTINCTION IS THAT INHERENTLY MASSLESS PARTICLES LIKE PHOTONS CAN ONLY MOVE AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT SO THEY EXPERIENCE INFINITE TIME DILATION I THINK YOU MAY BE ASKING THOUGH WHETHER THOSE OTHER PARTICLES CAN CAUSE TIME DILATION LIKE THE PHOTON DOES WHICH IS MISLEADING BECAUSE PHOTONS AREN'T THE CAUSE EITHER IT'S SIMPLY THAT PARTICLES THAT MOVE AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT ALWAYS MOVE AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT SO THEY BECOME A REFERENCE POINT FOR THE TIME DILATION EFFECT

AND SINCE THESE BOSONS ARE THE ONES MEDIATING THE FORCES OF NATURE AND THUS I ASSUME THE RATE AT WHICH NATURAL PROCESSES OCCUR DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE REASON TIME SLOWS DOWN AS YOU SPEED UP IS BECAUSE THE SPEED OF THE FORCES OF NATURE APART FROM ELECTROMAGNETISM DECREASES RELATIVE TO YOU

I DON'T THINK ANYONE CAN SAY WHY TIME SLOWS DOWN OTHER THAN IT'S A CONSEQUENCE OF OUR UNIVERSAL LAWS IT IS TRUE THAT AS TIME SLOWS DOWN THE RATE OF NATURAL PROCESSES ALSO SLOWS DOWN THAT'S NEARLY THE DEFINITION OF TIME SLOWING DOWN IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT AS FOR TIME DILATION EFFECTING NATURAL FORCES WE CAN CERTAINLY SEE THAT EXPERIMENTALLY FOR EXAMPLE MUONS THAT WE GENERATE IN A LAB MOVE FAIRLY SLOWLY WHEREAS MUONS WE SEE HIT THE EARTH FROM SPACE ARE GENERALLY MOVING AT OR SO THE SPEED OF LIGHT AS A CONSEQUENCE THE LIFETIME OF THE MUON BEFORE IT DECAYS IS MUCH LONGER FOR THE FAST-MOVING MUONS WHICH WE CAN MEASURE TO US IT LOOKS LIKE THE INTERNAL DECAY CLOCK IS RUNNING SLOWLY

AS AN OBSERVER GAINS A HIGHER VELOCITY THE SPEED OF LIGHT RELATIVE TO THE OBSERVER DECREASES

AS SOMEONE TRAVELS AT A HIGHER VELOCITY THE SPEED OF PHOTONS DECREASES RELATIVE TO HIM

DOES IT THE POSTULATE OF SPECIAL RELATIVITY IS THAT C IS CONSTANT IN ALL INERTIAL REFERENCE FRAMES

THE SPEED OF LIGHT IS NOT A PROPERTY OF PHOTONS IT'S THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A SECOND AND A METRE IN THIS UNIVERSE THEREFORE ANYTHING WHICH IS MASSLESS WILL PERMEATE THE UNIVERSE AT M EVERY SECOND

SO ALL THE FORCES ARE MEDIATED AT C AND THE SPEED OF FORCES IS NOT THE SOURCE OF SPACETIME DISTORTION

AS OTHERS HAVE SAID TIME AND SPACE WILL APPEAR NORMAL IN ANY SINGLE REFERENCE FRAME AGAIN STATED BY THE POSTULATE THE DISTORTIONS OCCUR BETWEEN REFERENCE FRAMES AND GENERALLY SPEAKING ALL OF THE COUNTER INTUITIVE SCENARIOS THAT ARE USED TO MAKE SPECIAL RELATIVITY SEEM CRAZY ARE ALL SIMPLY EXPLAINED BY ACCELERATION FOR EXAMPLE I'VE SEEN IT SAID THAT A CAR OF LENGTH D TRAVELLING AT C WILL NOT APPEAR TO BE THAT LENGTH BY A STATIONARY OBSERVER THEREFORE YOU CAN PARK IN A GARAGE THAT IS SHORTER THAN D BUT THERE HAS TO BE A FINITE DECELERATION OF THE CAR TO STOP AND SO THE SLOW DOWN AS IT ENTERS THE INERTIAL FRAME WILL RESULT IN BOTH SYSTEMS SEEING THE SAME CAR SIZE

YOU CAN THINK OF SPECIAL RELATIVITY FAIRLY SIMPLY AS A LANDSCAPE IN SPACETIME YOU WILL HAVE VALLEY OF SPACETIME THAT YOU CAN EXPERIENCE NAMELY YOUR LIGHTCONE THAT CONCEPT IS THE BEST VISUALISATION I THINK AS IT'S NOT A BULLSHIT ANALOGY GOOGLE THAT

YOU DO HIT ON SOMETHING THAT PERHAPS YOU DIDN'T REALISE OR MAYBE IT IS THE POINT OF YOUR CONFUSION THE REASON THAT LIGHT TRAVELS AT DIFFERENCE SPEEDS IN DIFFERENT MEDIA IS RELATED TO THE INTERACTION RATE IN THE MEDIA THE REASON OBJECTS ARE DISTORTED BY A LENS OR JUST IN WATER IS BECAUSE THE PHOTONS INTERACT MORE OFTEN PER UNIT LENGTH THE ANGLE OF THE RAY LINE YOU SEE IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE SPEED OF LIGHT IN THE MEDIUM LAW

OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD SO I MAY BE VERY WRONG IN SOME ASPECTS I'D USUALLY AVOID ANSWERING BUT THIS IS HOW I CAME TO SIMPLIFY THINGS WHEN ASKING SIMILAR QUESTIONS SO I HOPE IT COMPLEMENTS THE MORE EXPLANATIONS YOU'VE HAD
I'M NOT TOTALLY SURE IF YOU'RE STILL CHECKING THIS THREAD BUT IT'S WORTH A SHOT

AS OTHERS HAVE POINTED OUT THE SPEED OF LIGHT IS A CONSTANT ABOUT X M S FOR ALL OBSERVERS INCLUDING AN OBSERVER TRAVELING CLOSE TO THAT SPEED THAT CAUSES SOME PRETTY WACKY THINGS TO ARISE SUCH AS THE LENGTH CONTRACTIONS AND TIME DILATIONS YOU MENTION

ONE INTERESTING THING TO ADD IS THAT BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES EXPERIENCE THE TIME DILATION WITH SOME EVEN CRAZIER THEORETICAL CONSEQUENCES I KNOW IT DOESN'T DIRECTLY ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION BUT IT MAY BE SOMETHING YOU'D BE INTO
DELETED
AS AN OBSERVER GAINS A HIGHER VELOCITY THE SPEED OF LIGHT RELATIVE TO THE OBSERVER DECREASES THUS TO MAINTAIN THE CONSTANCY OF THE SPEED OF LIGHT THE FLOW OF TIME SHORTENS FOR THE OBSERVER

NUMBER TO AN OBSERVER ON A MOVING PLATFORM THE SPEED OF LIGHT REMAINS THE SAME AND THE SUBJECTIVE PERCEPTION OF TIME REMAINS THE SAME IT IS ONLY WHEN ONE FRAME OF REFERENCE COMPARES ITS MEASUREMENTS TO THOSE OBSERVED ON ANOTHER FRAME THAT TIME SEEMS TO HAVE DIFFERENT RATES AND THAT PERCEPTION HAS SOME INTERESTING PROPERTIES AS WELL FOR TWO PLATFORMS A AND B MOVING PAST EACH OTHER AT HIGH SPEED BOTH PLATFORMS SEE THE OTHER PLATFORM AS HAVING AN OBSERVED TIME RATE SLOWER THAN ITS OWN

BUT AGAIN ON THE LOCAL PLATFORM BOTH THE SPEED OF LIGHT AND SUBJECTIVE TIME PASSAGE SEEM NORMAL
RIGHT

THE SPEED OF LIGHT IS THE SAME FOR ANY OBSERVER REGARDLESS OF THEIR SPEED BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE IT'S COMPENSATED BY TIME DILATION WE CAN SHOW THAT BY THINKING ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO LIGHT GOING THE OTHER WAY ACCORDING TO YOUR THEORY TIME SHOULD SLOW DOWN BECAUSE OF LIGHT GOING IN THE DIRECTION OF YOUR MOTION BUT ACCELERATE BECAUSE OF LIGHT GOING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION HOW WOULD THAT WORK

WHAT HAPPENS INSTEAD IS SOMETHING THAT SEEMS VERY PECULIAR TO US BECAUSE WE'RE NOT USED TO IT IF YOU HAVE AN OBSERVER A ON EARTH AND AN OBSERVER B ON A MOVING SPACESHIP AND IF AT A SPECIFIC MOMENT THE SHIP EMITS PHOTONS FORWARD AND BACKWARDS OBSERVER B WILL ALWAYS SEE THEMSELVES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TWO PHOTONS AS THEY ARE MOVING AWAY FROM THE SHIP AT THE SAME SPEED WHILE OBSERVER A WILL SEE THE SPACESHIP CLOSER TO THE PHOTON MOVING FORWARD AS THE SHIP IS MOVING IN THE SAME DIRECTION

THIS ILLUSTRATES SOMETHING NOT WELL KNOWN FROM THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY SPEED CAN NOT ONLY DISTORT SPACE AND TIME IT CAN ALSO CHANGE SIMULTANEITY EVENTS THAT HAPPEN IN A SPECIFIC ORDER TO SOMEONE MIGHT HAPPEN SIMULTANEOUSLY OR EVEN IN REVERSE ORDER TO SOMEONE ELSE

IN ANY CASE YOUR PREMISE IS FLAWED AND OBVIOUSLY THE REST IS GOING TO BE PROBLEMATIC

AS SOMEONE TRAVELS AT A HIGHER VELOCITY THE SPEED OF PHOTONS DECREASES RELATIVE TO HIM

NOPE PHOTONS ALWAYS TRAVEL AT THE SAME SPEED TO ALL OBSERVERS

THE SAME THING DOES NOT OCCUR FOR OTHER W Z BOSONS GRAVITONS ETC DOES IT DOES THAT MEAN THAT UNLIKE PHOTONS THE SPEED OF THESE BOSONS ACTUALLY DOES DECREASE RELATIVE TO YOU

IT'S NOT JUST LIGHT ANY MASSLESS PARTICLE ALWAYS TRAVELS THROUGH A VACUUM AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT WHICH WOULD INCLUDE GLUONS AND GRAVITONS IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN W AND Z BOSONS HAVE MASS WHICH MEANS THEY COULD TRAVEL AT ANY SPEED LOWER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT AND IT IS THEORETICALLY POSSIBLE TO CHASE ONE AND CATCH UP WITH IT

DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE REASON TIME SLOWS DOWN AS YOU SPEED UP IS BECAUSE THE SPEED OF THE FORCES OF NATURE APART FROM ELECTROMAGNETISM DECREASES RELATIVE TO YOU

COPERS AS MENTIONED THIS IS NOT BECAUSE OF TIME DILATION

IF WE WANT TO ADDRESS TIME DILATION BRIEFLY THE PERCEIVED TIME BY ANY OBSERVER IS ALWAYS THE SAME AN HOUR ALWAYS FEELS LIKE AN HOUR TO YOU NO MATTER YOUR SPEED IT'S ALWAYS EXTERNAL OBJECTS THAT SEEM TO HAVE A SLOWER TIME AS LONG AS YOU'RE NOT ACCELERATING NOTE THAT IN THEIR POINT OF VIEW THEIR TIME IS PERFECTLY NORMAL AND YOUR TIME SEEMS TO GO SLOWER BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S ALL RELATIVE

ONE WAY TO LOOK AT IT IS TO SAY EVERYTHING GOES THROUGH SPACETIME AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT THE FASTER YOU GO THROUGH SPACE THE SLOWER YOU GO THROUGH TIME

PRINCIPLE CAN BE A BIT IT CAN HELP TO THINK OF PRESSURE IN TERMS OF THE KINETIC ENERGY OF THE INDIVIDUAL MOLECULES ATOMS OF THE FLUID IN THE PIPE

IF A FLUID IS SITTING IN THE PIPE AT SOME TEMPERATURE REMEMBER THAT TEMPERATURE IS JUST AVERAGE KINETIC ENERGY OF ATOMS THE ATOMS ARE WHIZZING AROUND IN RANDOM DIRECTIONS WE OBSERVE PRESSURE AS THE NET FORCE OF THOSE ATOMS STRIKING THE INSIDE OF THE PIPE NOW LET'S MOVE THAT FLUID ALONG THE PIPE ASSUMING CONSTANT TEMPERATURE THINK ENERGY IF THE KINETIC ENERGY IN ONE DIRECTION ALONG THE PIPE HAS INCREASED THEN THE KINETIC ENERGY OF RANDOM MOTION THINK PRESSURE HAS TO HAVE DECREASED
AN INCREASE IN SPEED IS CAUSED BY HAVING HIGH PRESSURE ON ONE SIDE AND LOW PRESSURE ON ANOTHER SIDE OF A FLUID PACKET LEADING TO A NET FORCE THEREFORE AS FLOW SPEEDS UP IT MUST BE TRAVELLING TO A LOWER PRESSURE REGION
SEE IT IN TERMS OF ENERGY WORK POTENTIAL ENERGY KINETIC ENERGY CONSTANT NOW WORK IS FORCE TIMES DISPLACEMENT POTENTIAL ENERGY IS MASS TIMES G TIMES HEIGHT AND KINETIC ENERGY IS MASS TIMES VELOCITY SQUARED SINCE THE VOLUME OF WATER BEING DISPLACED IS CONSTANT THEN YOU CAN DIVIDE EVERYTHING BY THE VOLUME OF WATER AND IT'LL STILL BE A CONSTANT SO YOU GET BERNOULLI EQUATION FORCE TIMES DISPLACEMENT DIVIDED BY VOLUME BECOMES FORCE DIVIDED BY AREA PRESSURE MASS TIMES G TIMES HEIGHT BECOMES DENSITY TIMES G TIMES HEIGHT AND MASS TIMES VELOCITY SQUARED BECOMES DENSITY TIMES VELOCITY SQUARED SO NOW THAT YOU HAVE THAT AND THE EQUATION OF CONTINUITY IT FOLLOWS THAT IF YOU INCREASE VELOCITY AND KEEP HEIGHT THE SAME THEN PRESSURE MUST DROP SO THAT ENERGY IS CONSERVED
THERE ARE SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF MACROSCOPIC QUANTUM PHENOMENA PROBABLY THE MOST WELL-KNOWN MACROSCOPIC QUANTUM PHENOMENON IS SUPERCONDUCTIVITY HERE'S A DEMONSTRATION SOME OTHER EXAMPLES INCLUDE SUPERFLUIDITY AND THE TUNNELING MICROSCOPE WHICH COULD NOT WORK WITHOUT QUANTUM EFFECTS IF WE WERE TO RUN THE UNIVERSE BACK TO SOME POINT AND START IT OVER IT WOULD BE EXCEEDINGLY UNLIKELY THAT WE WOULD END UP IN THE STATE WE ARE CURRENTLY IN
RANDOM QUANTUM FLUCTUATIONS IN THE FIRST MOMENTS OF THE BIG BANG DETERMINED WHERE GALAXIES AND GALAXY CLUSTERS WOULD FORM BECAUSE OF INFLATION EVIDENCE FOR THIS CAN BE SEEN IN THE COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND SO THE UNIVERSE WOULD BE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT EVERY TIME YOU REPEATED THE BIG BANG AND IN MOST VERSIONS YOU WOULD NOT RUN OUT OF MILK
QUANTUM MECHANICS IS NOT DETERMINISTIC IF YOU REWIND AND REPLAY IT WILL BE DIFFERENT

BTW EVEN IN A DETERMINISTIC FRAMEWORK LIKE MANY WORLDS YOU EXPERIENCE INDETERMINISM IN THAT CASE WHILE THE BIG GENERAL STATE EVOLVES DETERMINISTICALLY THE INDETERMINISM COMES FROM THE FACT THAT YOUR WORLD IS A PARTIAL STATE IN OTHER WORDS THE WORLD YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF IN IN THE END WILL ESSENTIALLY BE A RANDOMLY SAMPLED WORLD THEREFORE DIFFERENT EVERY TIME

OTHER INTERPRETATIONS OF QM ARE PURELY DETERMINISTIC MORE IN THE SENSE OF HIDDEN VARIABLES IF SOMETHING LIKE DE BROGLIE BOHM PILOT WAVES EXTENDS TO A FULLY FUNCTIONAL INTERPRETATION OF QM THEN YOU ALSO WILL HAVE INDETERMINISM WHEN REWINDING YOU DON'T REWIND THE UNDERLYING CLASSICAL STATE WHICH IS HIDDEN YOU ONLY REWIND THE RESULTING QUANTUM STATE WHICH IS MEASURABLE THIS MEANS YOU WON'T NECESSARILY RECONSTRUCT THE ORIGINAL CLASSICAL STATE THEREFORE IT WILL AGAIN PLAY OUT DIFFERENTLY
I'M GONNA IGNORE THE I EAST BUT YEAH QUANTUM EFFECTS CAN HAVE MACRO APPLICATIONS MY PERSONAL FAVORITE IS HOW PLANT CELLS DISTRIBUTE ENERGY GAINED FROM PHOTOSYNTHESIS PRETTY FRIGGING WEIRD
DETERMINISM IS NOT A FALSIFIABLE THEORY SO THERE'S NO SCIENTIFIC ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION


DO QUANTUM EFFECTS EVER MANIFEST IN THE

WELL IN A WORD YES FOR EXAMPLE DID YOU POST YOUR QUESTION FROM A COMPUTER I THINK YES ARE YOU AWARE THAT INTEGRATED CIRCUITS RELY ON QUANTUM MECHANICS TO FUNCTION AS THEY DO I THINK YES AGAIN SO IT CAN BE SAID THAT QUANTUM THEORIES ARE ESSENTIAL TO YOUR COMPUTER'S OPERATION AND TO THIS CONVERSATION

I EAST IF WE RAN BACK THE UNIVERSE'S CLOCKS AND ROLLED THE DICE AGAIN WOULD THE OUTCOME STILL BE THE SAME

PROBABLY NOT BUT YOU MAY BE FOCUSING TOO MUCH ATTENTION ON THE PROBABILISTIC ASPECTS OF QUANTUM THEORY FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU FLIP A COIN ONCE WHAT IS THE PROBABILITY THAT THE COIN WILL LAND ON EDGE NOT VERY HIGH BUT IF YOU FLIP THE COIN A MILLION TIMES WHAT'S THE PROBABILITY OF GETTING A MILLION SEQUENTIAL HEADS OUTCOMES ALSO NOT VERY HIGH IS THERE A ROLE FOR QUANTUM THEORY IN THIS OUTCOME NO NOT REALLY ORDINARY PHYSICAL PROCESSES CAN PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE EXPLANATION
I ENJOY POKING AROUND THE PHYSICS DEPT WEB SITES OF VARIOUS UNIVERSITIES SOME OF THEM POST SOME REALLY NICE MATERIALS LECTURE NOTES SOME ARE QUITE DETAILED PRACTICE PROBLEMS WITH SOLUTIONS VIDEOS AND DFS OF SEMINARS COLLOQUIA AND CONFERENCES THIS IS AN ESPECIALLY FAVORITE INTEREST OF MINE ETC

FOR EXAMPLE FOR PROBLEM SETS PHYSICS DEPT HAS POSTED WEEKS WORTH OF PROBLEM OF THE WEEK ALONG WITH THE SOLUTIONS THEY'RE FROM AROUND BUT STILL A NICE RESOURCE SEE
DO YOU HAVE ANY BOOKS LEFT FROM WHEN YOU WERE STILL STUDYING I'D SAY THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO GET SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE BACK UP
HYPERPHYSICS WOULD BE THE ONLY COMPREHENSIVE ALBEIT VERY CONCISE PHYSICS ENCYCLOPEDIA WEBSITE I CAN THINK OF IT IS BY NO MEANS A WEBSITE TO SOLVE PROBLEMS BUT I THINK THOSE SITES WOULD BE HARD TO FIND ANYWAY
I RECOMMEND READING THE QUANTUM MECHANICS THEORETICAL MINIMUM BOOK BY LENNY SUSSKIND AND ART FRIEDMAN YOU MAY ALREADY KNOW A LOT IN THERE BUT IT'S A GREAT MOTIVATOR TO GET BACK INTO THE SWING OF THINGS I HAVE HEARD THE CLASSICAL MECHANICS ONE IS ALSO GOOD BUT PERHAPS THAT WOULD BE A LITTLE SIMPLE FOR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR

ALSO STARTING STUDY ON A NEW FIELD YOU HAVEN'T DIPPED IN YET MIGHT PROVE FRUITFUL FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'D LIKE TO LEARN GR SEAN BOOK SPACETIME AND GEOMETRY IS A GREAT PLACE TO START AND YOU GET TO LEARN SOME DOPE MATH ALONG THE WAY

ENJOY DOING PHYSICS AGAIN
SCHAUM OUTLINES AND PROBLEM BOOKS ARE PROBABLY SUFFICIENT FOR MECHANICS AND E MASCULINE

GOING A STEP FURTHER YOU COULD USE SOMETHING LIKE ANDI TO SCHEDULE REVIEW OF PROBLEMS YOU'VE SOLVED
I LOVE VIDEOS AND I UNDERSTAND HE'S SIMPLIFYING FOR THE AUDIENCE BUT HE'S MISSING SOME CAVEATS THAT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT TO TRULY CALL IT A COMPLETE SOLUTION

WHERE IS THE ASYMMETRY BETWEEN THE TWINS THE TRAVELLING TWIN ALSO SEE THE STAY-AT-HOME TWIN TRAVEL ON AN ACCELERATED PATH WITH A KINK IN IT CHANGING THE PLANES OF SIMULTANEITY IT WOULD SEEM ABSOLUTE ACCELERATION IS IMPORTANT WHICH THE VIDEO DOESN'T MENTION

BUT THERE ARE ALSO PROBLEMS WITHOUT ABSOLUTE ACCELERATION LIKE WHAT IF THE TRAVELLING TWIN SLINGSHOTS AROUND A PLANET INSTEAD OF USING ROCKET ENGINES TO ACCELERATE HE WOULD NEVER EXPERIENCE A PROPER ACCELERATION OBSCURING THE ASYMMETRY OF THE SITUATIONS THE DIFFERENCE HERE BEING OF COURSE THAT HE SPEND TIME DEEP IN A GRAVITATIONAL FIELD AND THE STAY-AT-HOME TWIN WOULD BE VERY HIGH IN IT MAKING TIME MOVE FASTER THERE OR WHAT IF THERE'S TWO INERTIALLY TRAVELLING TWINS ONE GOING EAST AND ONE GOING WEST AND THEY SYNCHRONIZE CLOCKS AT THE MIDDLE OF THE TRAJECTORY AVOIDING ANY SORT OF ACCELERATION

OR WHAT IF SPACE IS CLOSED WHICH WOULD MEAN THERE WOULD BE PERIODIC INERTIAL ORBITS WHERE THE TWINS COULD REGULARLY COMPARE AGES AT FIRST SIGHT THE REFERENCE FRAMES OF THE TWINS WOULD SEEM COMPLETELY EQUIVALENT SURPRISINGLY WELL I WAS SURPRISED WHEN I LEARNT IT IT TURNS OUT THAT IN COMPACT SPACES THE TOPOLOGY DEFINES AN ABSOLUTE PREFERRED FRAME OF REFERENCE BOTH TWINS WOULD AGREE ON THAT FRAME AND THEIR RESPECTIVE VELOCITIES COMPARED TO IT AND THUS WOULD AGREE ON THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE AGES

I DO LOVE MINUTEPHYSICS OF COURSE I WISH THEY'D EXISTED WHEN I WAS YOUNG
OKAY SO WHY IS THE SPACESHIP TWIN YOUNGER EVEN THOUGH BOTH TWINS MAINTAIN THE SAME VELOCITY RELATIVE TO THE OTHER THROUGHOUT THE TRIP

I DON'T FEEL THIS RESOLVES THE PARADOX IT ONLY EXPLAINS IT THOROUGHLY
ARE THERE ANY VIDEOS LIKE THIS ON THE EHRENFEST PARADOX BECAUSE I STILL CANT GET MY HEAD AROUND THAT ONE
JESUS I'M LEAVING THIS THREAD MORE CONFUSED THAN WHEN I ENTERED
HOW DO WE CALCULATE FROM THE SHIP'S REST FRAME THE PASSAGE OF TIME ON EARTH DURING THE SHIP'S TURNAROUND ACCELERATION FOR EXAMPLE HOW COULD WE CALCULATE A VALUE OF S WITHOUT JUST SUBTRACTING

IF FOR SIMPLICITY'S SAKE WE ASSUME A CONSTANT ACCELERATION I GET THAT THE SITUATION IS ESSENTIALLY GRAVITATIONAL TIME DILATION AS IF A LARGE GRAVITY IS CAUSING THE SHIP'S ACCELERATION BUT I HAVEN'T YET COVERED GENERAL RELATIVITY IN MY COURSEWORK SO I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW THIS CALCULATION WOULD BE DONE
IT HAS SEEMED TO ME FOR QUITE A CONFUSING NUMBER OF YEARS THAT THE TWINS PARADOX HAS MORE TO DO WITH ACCELERATION THAN VELOCITY

WHEN THE VELOCITY OF THE SHIP IS CONSTANT EACH TWIN SEES THE CLOCK AS RUNNING SLOWER BY THE SAME AMOUNT WHICH CANCELS EACH OTHER OUT CORRECT

THEN IT'S ONLY IN THE ACCELERATION TO THE CONSTANT VELOCITY WHERE THE MAGIC HAPPENS

TO GET TO C M S IT TAKES A SHIP ABOUT DAYS ACCELERATING AT A COMFORTABLE M S 2 LINK TO ONLINE CALCULATOR

SO THE TIME DILATION OF A YEAR TRIP FROM THE EARTH TWIN'S FRAME OF REFERENCE HAPPENS ONLY IN THOSE DAYS THE INITIAL ACCELERATION TO 2 THE NEGATIVE ACCELERATION AT SOME DISTANT POINT TO EARTH FRAME ZERO THE INITIAL ACCELERATION TO HEADING BACK TO EARTH AND THE FINAL NEGATIVE ACCELERATION TO EARTH FRAME ZERO

IT SEEMS LIKE THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ACCELERATIONS WOULD CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT BUT

TL R

TRUE OR FALSE WHENEVER THE SHIP IS TRAVELING AT A CONSTANT VELOCITY BOTH TWINS AGE AT THE SAME RATE
THESE FACTS UPSET ME SO MUCH

I'M A REAL BIG FAN OF THINKING WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET PAST LIGHT SPEED WITH NO ISSUES I'M IGNORING THE POWER ISSUES SHUT IT BUT THEN YOU THINK ABOUT THIS TIME BULLSHIT AND ALL THE FUN GOES TO SHIT

NOT FAIR UNIVERSE NOT FAIR
THIS REALLY FELT LIKE AN ABBOTT AND COSTELLO ROUTINE IF THEY DID PHYSICS
HEY GUYS I HAD A QUESTION REGARDING GENERAL RELATIVITY IF I AM TRAVELLING IN A SPACESHIP CLOSE TO THE SPEED OF LIGHT AND MY TWIN IS ON EARTH I WOULD HAVE AGED WAY MORE THAN HIM WHEN I RETURN BACK THE PROBLEM I HAVE ABOUT THIS CONCEPT TIME IS RELATIVELY SLOWER FOR ME THAN HIM HENCE WOULD I LIVE OUT A LIFESPAN FROM TIME OR MY OWN TIME
LET US ASSUME HUMANS DIE AT YEARS AT AGE I LEAVE IN THE SPACESHIP AND RETURN BACK TO EARTH MY TWIN IS NOW AGED AND MY AGE IS WOULD I LIVE MORE YEAR ON EARTH OR LIVE MORE
THANKS

ANY OF FINNS SWEDES THAT CAN RECOMMAND ME A GOOD SECOND HAND BOOKSTORE SITE IN HELSINKI OR STOCKHOLM
IM AN UPPER YEAR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT AND I'M LOOKING FOR A GOOD REFERENCE TEXT FOR STATISTICS SOMETHING AKIN TO MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN THE SCIENCES BY BOAZ BUT MORE FOCUSED ON REGRESSION STATISTICS TESTING AND DEALING WITH DISCRETE DATA ANY SUGGESTIONS

FOR CONTEXT I HAVE NEVER TAKEN A TRUE STATS COURSE AT MY SCHOOL BUT I HAVE HAD A FAIRLY DECENT AMOUNT OF STATS COVERED IN LABS AND COURSES THROUGHOUT MY UNDERGRAD I WOULD CONSIDER MYSELF A BEGINNER IN TERMS OF MY KNOWLEDGE OF STATISTICS
HI I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING REALLY SPECIFIC A QUICK AND DIRTY GUIDE TO SOLVING UNDERGRADUATE LEVEL MECHANICS AND E M PROBLEMS FROM A SYMMETRY PERSPECTIVE I KNOW THERE ARE TEXTBOOKS BUT I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING SHORT AND TO THE POINT REALLY MORE OF A TUTORIAL THAN ANYTHING SOMETHING THAT EMPHASIZES PROBLEM SOLVING OVER THEORY ANYONE KNOW OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS
JUST STARTED A MODULE ON THERMODYNAMICS AND MY PROF IS SO INCOMPREHENSIBLE AND KEEPS GOING OFF TANGENT

DOES ANYONE HAVE A GOOD BOOK FOR THERMODYNAMICS TO RECOMMEND
I FEEL LIKE THIS ARTICLE DIDN'T DO ENOUGH TO ADDRESS THE CRY WOLF CONCERNS FOCUSING ON PAPERS FROM TO FROM A DECEASED COLLABORATOR BUT NOT TALKING ABOUT THE MORE SIMILAR PAPERS FROM TO FROM THE SAME GROUP THAT THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES

NEVERTHELESS IT'S GOOD TO SEE ALL THIS INFORMATION IN ONE PLACE I'LL TRY TO BE OPTIMISTIC
TL R
INTUITION IN PHYSICS OR MATHEMATICS IS FOR ME KNOWING WHETHER SOME RESULT SEEMS RIGHT AS YOU SAY TOO

THAT'S COMPLETELY DETERMINED BY WHAT YOU ARE USED TO AND WHAT EXPERIENCE YOU HAVE IN MATHEMATICS SEVERAL PROBLEMS RELATING TO INFINITY MIGHT SEEM UNINTUITIVE TO A MATHEMATICALLY UNTRAINED PERSON WHILE IT MIGHT MAKE PERFECT SENSE INTUITIVELY FOR A MATHEMATICIAN UNFAMILIAR WITH THIS PROBLEM BUT WITH SOME EXPERIENCE WITH RELATED PROBLEMS HE WON'T BE SURPRISED

THE SAME IS TRUE IN QUANTUM MECHANICS WHERE IT IS OFTEN QUOTED AS PRODUCING UNINTUITIVE RESULTS THEY MAY BE UNINTUITIVE FOR SOMEONE TAKING CLASSICAL MECHANICS TO SERIOUSLY OR NOT HAVING MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH QUANTUM MECHANICS BUT I FOR INSTANCE WOULDN'T CALL QUANTUM MECHANICAL TUNNELLING THROUGH A BARRIER YOU WOULDN'T IF YOU'RE USED TO IT THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS UNIVERSALLY IT'S DIFFERENT FROM PERSON TO PERSON

ANYWAY NO ONE WILL USE PURE INTUITION AS IF IT WERE ACTUAL SCIENTIFIC WORK IT'S MORE SOMETHING THAT GUIDES YOU BUT IN THE END YOU WON'T RELY ON SOME FEELING BUT YOU WILL ACTUALLY DO AN EXPERIMENT OR ACTUALLY CALCULATE A MODEL I DON'T THINK YOU WILL EVER CHOOSE ONE RESULT OVER ANOTHER BY PURE INTUITION
I FEEL THAT INTUITION IS PRETTY INAPPLICABLE TO PHYSICS INTUITION TENDS TO BE BASED ON COMMON SENSE AND NORMAL EXPERIENCE BUT PHYSICS TENDS TO STUDY THINGS THAT AREN'T PART OF THE COMMON HUMAN EXPERIENCE WHEN I FIRST STUDIED RELATIVITY MY BOOK SAID IT BEST THIS MAY SEEM COUNTER INTUITIVE BUT INTUITION COMES FROM COMMON INTERACTIONS THAT VERY RARELY ACCOUNT FOR THINGS LIKE THE SPEED OF LIGHT
JUST A HEADS UP TO PHYSICISTS SAYING INTUITION MEANS SOMETHING KIND OF DIFFERENT WHEN WE USE IT AS A NOUN WE USUALLY MEAN LIKE HAVING A PHYSICAL FEELING FOR SOMETHING WE SAY PHYSICAL INTUITION WHEN WE REALLY MEAN ANALOGY

I THINK INTUITION COMES UP OFTEN IN EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS I REMEMBER IN NUCLEAR LABS HAVING TO USE A LOT OF INTUITION BEING ABLE TO WORK OUT WHETHER OUR DETECTOR WAS SET UP PROPERLY NOT WANTING TO WAIT TO COLLECT A FULL SET OF RESULTS I THINK THAT INTUITION IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE WHAT NEXT STEPS IN BUILDING UP AN EXPERIMENT AND DOING RESEARCH AROUND IT

EDIT WHY DO PEOPLE LIKE U THECHINESECOYS MAKE THREADS LIKE THIS BUT DON'T REPLY WHEN SOMEONE POSTS THINGS INCONSIDERATE ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING IT WAS THE ONLY RESPONSE I SEE THAT A LOT IN THIS SUB PEOPLE ASK A QUESTION AND THEN JUST FUCK OFF
WHY IS IT THAT GALAXIES LIKE THIS POINT TO DARK MATTER INSTEAD OF POINTING TO THE IDEA THAT OUR ASSUMPTIONS ARE INCORRECT ABOUT DETERMINING THE MASS OF A GALAXY
I GLANCED THROUGH THE PAPER IT SEEMS LIKE THE ENTIRE CALCULATION OF BARYONIC MASS IS BASED ENTIRELY ON THE LUMINOSITY OF THE GALAXY I COULDN'T FIND ANY MENTION OF THE STUDY DOING A SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF THAT PARTICULAR GALAXY ONLY USING STUDIES OF OTHER DUGS AS A BASELINE SO IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE WE KNOW FOR SURE WHAT THE EXACT STELLAR COMPOSITION OF THIS GALAXY COULD BE GIVEN THIS ISN'T IT A BIT PREMATURE TO SAY ITS MASS IS ALMOST ENTIRELY MADE OF DARK MATTER IT'S CERTAINLY SUSPICIOUS AND EASY TO SEE HOW ONE WOULD ARRIVE AT THIS CONCLUSION BUT IF I'M UNDERSTANDING CORRECTLY THIS COULD PLAUSIBLY BE A GALAXY WHICH FOR WHATEVER REASON APPEARS FAR LESS LUMINOUS THAN OTHERS IN ITS CLASSICAL COULD THIS NOT BE EXPLAINED BY A ADMITTEDLY VERY ODD NUMBER OF HIGH-DENSITY OBJECTS IN THAT GALAXY

SOMEONE PLEASE SET ME STRAIGHT IF I MISSED SOME CRITICAL ASPECT OF THE PAPER OR AM BEING A BIT OBLIVIOUS


ANYBODY KNOW HOW CLOSE THIS GALAXY IS IS THE UNIVERSE LITTERED WITH THESE OBJECTS AND WE'VE SIMPLY NOT FOUND THEM DUE TO THEIR DIMNESS WEIRDNESS

EDIT THE ARXIV PAPER ASSUMES MPC WOW THAT'S CLOSE NOW I'M WONDERING IF THEY HAVE INSTRUMENT TIME TO DO A DETAILED SPECTROSCOPY AND DETERMINE THE TYPES OF STARS THAT ARE VISIBLE
UPDATE A QUANTA MAGAZINE ARTICLE DATED FOLLOW-UP ABOUT THIS DISCOVERY WITH VARIOUS INTERPRETATIONS ALSO HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE TIME IS NOW BEING DEVOTED TO STUDYING THIS DRAGONFLY GALAXY AND A SEARCH IS ON TO SEE IF OTHERS LIKE THIS CAN BE FOUND OUTSIDE OF GALAXY CLUSTERS AND CLOSER TO US

I'M STILL AMAZED THAT WE DON'T HAVE A MEANS TO DETECT AND STUDY DARK MATTER THIS IS AN INTERESTING FIND
ITS MASS
AND THEY NAMED IT DRAGONFLY THEY SHOULD HAVE DUBBED IT THE CHOCOLATE MILKY WAY DUH

I WON'T TRY AND EXPLAIN IT HERE'S A POSSIBLY GOOD ANSWER
ENERGY IS NOT CONSERVED IN A UNIVERSE
I'VE BEEN STUCK WITH A PROBLEM CONCERNING THIS I WAS CONSIDER MAKING A THREAD OR WAITING UNTIL I SEE ANOTHER QUESTIONS OF THE WEEK THREAD

MY QUESTION IS CONCERNING THE DOPPLER EFFECT AND REDSHIFT IN PARTICULAR THE LIGHT WE RECEIVE FROM ALL THE GALAXIES ARE REDSHIRTED IMPLYING THAT THEY ARE TRAVELING AWAY FROM US SPACE IS IMMENSE DUH WE KNOW AND COMPREHENDING THESE DISTANCES IS IMPOSSIBLY HARD FOR THE HUMAN BRAIN SPACE ISN'T A PERFECT VACUUM HAVING A FEW ATOMS PER METER CUBED THESE ATOMS WOULD ALMOST DEFINITELY BE HYDROGEN OR HELIUM AND CONTINUING DOWN IN ORDER OF ABUNDANCE THE AMOUNT OF METERS IN ONE LIGHT YEAR IS THAT WOULD MAKE LIGHT TRAVELING FROM THOSE GALAXIES HUNDREDS OF LIGHT YEARS AWAY HAVING TO INTERACT WITH ATOMS AT SOME POINT ON THEIR JOURNEY TO EARTH COULD THIS INTERACTION NOT IMPEDE THE PHOTONS CAUSING LIGHT TO APPEAR REDSHIRTED TO THE OBSERVE HERE ON EARTH IF LIGHT INTERACTS WITH HEAVIER ELEMENTS LIKE IRON OR LEAD ULTRA RARE COULD THIS CAUSE PHOTONS WAVE LENGTH TO BE STRETCHED OUT AND APPEAR RED

I LOOKED UP HOW LIGHT INTERACTS WITH ATOMS EMPHASIZING ON IT BEING A FEW ATOMS AND FOUND A FEW THINGS OUT EVENTUALLY I GOT TO A POINT WHERE I WAS HAVING TO GOOGLE SEARCH EVERY OTHER WORD SHOWING I'M IN OVER MY HEAD I APPRECIATE ANY HELP WITH THIS I LOVE PHYSICS AND I'M TAKING MY FIRST COURSE IN IT THIS YEAR I ASKED MY TEACHER BUT HIS RESPONSE WAS LIGHT HAS NO MASSACHUSETTS WHICH IS TRUE BUT I DIDN'T FULLY EXPLAIN MY QUESTION SO IT DIDN'T ANSWER MY QUESTION ENTIRELY
I DISAGREE WITH THE CONCLUSION THAT THE NEW SU 2 MUST BE CONFINING AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT FOLLOWS FROM THAT LIKE THAT PARTICLES MUST BE WEAK ISOSPIN SINGLETS LAST TIME I DID THIS CALCULATION IT TURNED OUT THE I FUNCTION WAS POSITIVE THERE ARE TOO MANY SU 2 CHARGED FERMIONS
IT'S NOT PART IN INSTEAD IT'S THAT ONE OF THE THEORETICAL PREDICTIONS FOR THE COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT IS TIMES LARGER THAN THE COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT THAT'S OBSERVED I DON'T THINK ANYTHING IN HUMANITY HAS EVER BEEN MEASURED TO PART IN
YES THE COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT IS ONE OF A NUMBER OF PHYSICAL VALUES THAT ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO THE KNOWN STRUCTURE OF THE UNIVERSE SUCH THAT IF THEIR VALUES WERE OUTSIDE A LIMITED RANGE THE UNIVERSE COULD NOT SUPPORT LIFE HENCE THE PREMISE WHICH YOU CAN READ ABOUT AT AND

IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THIS TOPIC OF YOU MAY BE INTERESTED IN MARTIN REES BOOK JUST SIX NUMBERS WHICH THE ARTICLES REFER TO

BEFORE THERE WAS NO DIRECT EVIDENCE FOR A COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT HAVING A VALUE THE KNOWN OBSERVATIONAL CONSTRAINTS ON AN UPPER BOUND FOR IT WERE SO INCREDIBLY SMALL THAT MANY PHYSICISTS SUSPECTED THAT IT MUST BE PRECISELY ZERO WELL IT ISN'T ZERO BUT IT IS VERY SMALL AND YET IF IT WERE SUFFICIENTLY LARGER AS THE ABOVE ARTICLES POINT OUT STARS AND GALAXIES COULD NOT HAVE FORMED

IT IT WERE ZERO ETHAN SIEGEL WROTE AN ARTICLE ABOUT WHAT THE EFFECT WOULD BE ON OUR UNIVERSE

IF IT HAD A NEGATIVE INSTEAD OF POSITIVE VALUE THE UNIVERSE REGARDLESS IF IT IS SPATIALLY FLAT OR POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY CURVED WOULD EVENTUALLY STOP EXPANDING AND COLLAPSE BACK IN ON ITSELF IN A BIG CRUNCH

CURRENT EVIDENCE IS THAT THE UNIVERSE IS FLAT AND THAT THE COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT WILL CONTINUE TO CAUSE THE RATE OF EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE TO ACCELERATE AND THUS IT WILL EXPAND FOREVER OR SO IT'S SPECULATED THERE ARE POSSIBLE CAVEATS BASED ON CURRENT UNDERSTANDINGS

IF YOU WANT A LITTLE MORE INFO ON THE COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT ALSO COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS DARK ENERGY BESIDES THE WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE ON IT ETHAN SIEGEL WROTE ABOUT IT HERE
WOULDN'T THAT JUST BE ANGLE
YES ANGULAR VELOCITY IS THE TIME RATE OF CHANGE OF ANGULAR POSITION INTEGRATION BETWEEN T1 AND GIVES YOU THE NET ANGULAR DISPLACEMENT BETWEEN THOSE TIMES
WITH RESPECT TO WHAT TIME YOU CERTAINLY CAN JUST LIKE INTEGRATING REGULAR VELOCITY OVER TIME GIVES YOU DISPLACEMENT INTEGRATING ANGULAR VELOCITY OVER TIME GIVES YOU ANGULAR DISPLACEMENT

IF YOU WANT TO INTEGRATE WITH RESPECT TO SOMETHING ELSE THEN YOU MIGHT HAVE PROBLEMS

I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF IMAGE PROCESSING LATELY BUT AM STILL A COMPLETE BOOB BEEN USING JET WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT FOR MANY DATA VISUALIZATIONS THANKS FOR SHARING THIS
I USUALLY TAKE A LOOK AT COLORBREWER IF I ONLY NEED A FEW COLORS FOR BASIC PLOTS

EDIT FOR HEAT DENSITY MAPS I TAKE ONE POSTED HERE
OFF TOPIC I FOUND YOU
JET A TOKAMAK IN EUROPE WAS ABLE TO SUSTAIN A FUSION POWER OUTPUT OF MW FOR SECONDS WHILE THIS WAS NOT A NET ENERGY GAIN IT WAS STILL A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUSION POWER FOR A SUSTAINED AMOUNT OF TIME I'LL ALSO NOTE THAT THIS EXPERIMENT WAS DONE IN

THE TRUTH IS THAT MOST MAGNETIC CONFINEMENT EXPERIMENTS DON'T ACTUALLY USE FUEL THE REASON IS THAT TRITIUM OPERATION IS REALLY REALLY REALLY EXPENSIVE INSTEAD WE CAN MAKE A LOT OF PROGRESS FOR A FRACTION OF THE COST USING A SURROGATE FUEL THAT DOES NOT FUSE SO WHILE THE NET POWER OUTPUT IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL QUOTING THE RECORD POWER OUTPUT ISN'T REALLY THE BEST METRIC TO SUMMARIZE THE CURRENT STATE MAGNETIC FUSION RESEARCH THERE HAVE BEEN YEARS OF PROGRESS SINCE JET LAST PERFORMED IT'S RECORD SHOTS AS FAR AS I KNOW THAT RUN CAMPAIGN WAS THE LAST TIME A LARGE SCALE MAGNETIC FUSION EXPERIMENT USED

SECOND I WOULDN'T SAY THAT ITER IS NEAR ITS DUE DATE THE CURRENT SCHEDULE PREDICTS THAT IT GOING TO TAKE ANOTHER YEARS TO CONSTRUCT ITER THEN THE PLAN IS TO USE A SURROGATE FUEL FOR SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE OPERATION SO IF EVERYTHING GOES ACCORDING TO THE CURRENT PLAN THEN IT'S STILL GOING TO BE YEARS BEFORE OPERATIONS IN ITER AND THATS A BIG IF IN THEY WERE PREDICTING THAT ITER WOULD BEGIN OPERATIONS AROUND

FINALLY STARS HAVE 2 HUGE ADVANTAGES THAT WE CAN'T REPLICATE IN FUSION DEVICES ON EARTH THE FIRST IS GRAVITY STARS USE GRAVITY TO CONFINE THE PLASMA WE CAN'T REPLICATE THIS GRAVITY IN AN EXPERIMENT ON EARTH SO WE NEED SOME OTHER WAY TO CONFINE THE PLASMA THE SECOND ADVANTAGE IS THAT STARS ARE REALLY BIG SO WHILE STARS PRODUCE A LOT OF POWER THE ACTUALLY HAVE A RATHER SMALL POWER DENSITY I'VE HEARD THE POWER DENSITY IN THE CORE OF OUR SUN IS ACTUALLY COMPARABLE TO METABOLIC RATE OF A LIZARD IN FUSION POWER PLANTS WE WILL USE A FUEL THAT IS MUCH MORE EFFICIENT THAN THE FUEL OF STARS AFTER ALL A SWIMMING POOL SIZED REACTOR FILLED WITH LIZARDS ISN'T GOING TO POWER A CITY
DON'T IMAGINE THE OUTCOME FOR ITER IS AT ALL CERTAIN IT'S AN ENGINEERING PROTOTYPE WITH MANY UNCERTAINTIES THE FUNDING FOR ITER REFLECTS MORE THE ENORMOUS VALUE OF FUSION RESEARCH THAN THE PROSPECT FOR A SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION TO THE PROJECT

FUSION AS AN ENGINEERING PROJECT FACES SOME SERIOUS CHALLENGES TWO OF WHICH ARE SUSTAINED FUSION REACTION AND SUCCESSFUL CONFINEMENT BOTH HAVE ONLY BEEN APPROXIMATED AND BOTH REMAIN TO BE PERFECTED IN AN ENGINEERING SENSE I SAY ENGINEERING BECAUSE THE SCIENCE IS WELL-UNDERSTOOD BUT HOW TO TURN THE SCIENCE INTO A WORKING PROTOTYPE IS THE PROBLEM

THEN THERE'S THE ISSUE OF BREAK-EVEN IN WHICH A FUSION REACTION PRODUCES AS MUCH OR MORE ENERGY THAN IT CONSUMES WE HAVE ONLY APPROACHED THIS GOAL IN OUR BEST EFFORTS AND WE STILL DON'T HAVE A SUSTAINABLE BREAK-EVEN REACTOR

SO THE JURY IS STILL OUT

THE PROBLEM WITH ITER IS THAT SCALING UP IS NOT REALLY A VIABLE WAY TO MAKE A FUSION POWER PLANT IF WE LOOK AT HOW MANY COUNTRIES IT IS TAKING TO MAKE JUST THIS PROTOTYPE EXPERIMENT AND SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGY FOR IT HASN'T EVEN BEEN INVENTED YET AND MAY NEVER BE LIKE THE WALL MATERIAL FOR THE PLASMA CONTAINER THEN THIS DIRECTION DOESN'T REALLY LOOK PROMISING IT IS A GOOD SCIENCE EXPERIMENT THAT WILL TEACH US A LOT BUT THE FUTURE PROBABLY LIES IN SMALLER SCALE STUFF

MIT'S SPARC PROJECT LOOKS MORE PROMISING GENERAL FUSION IN VANCOUVER IS ALSO INTERESTING THERE ARE A LOT OF SMALL SCALE EXPERIMENTS GOING ON

CHECK THIS OUT

BREAKTHROUGH IN NUCLEAR FUSION PROF DENNIS WHYTE YOUTUBE

MICHEL LABERGE HOW SYNCHRONIZED HAMMER STRIKES COULD GENERATE NUCLEAR FUSION YOUTUBE
FROM WHAT I HAVE READ THE LONGEST FUSION REACTION MADE BY HUMANS WAS MILLISECONDS



I THINK ALL YOUR QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED HERE

COULD WE POTENTIALLY AIM TO MAKE A FORM OF FUSION CLOSER TO THAT OF A RED DWARF

I DON'T THINK WE COMPARE A FUSION REACTOR TO ANY KIND OF STAR STARS ARE VERY INEFFICIENT AT DOING FUSION THEY RELY ON THEIR HUGE GRAVITATIONAL PRESSURE AND MASS TO ACHIEVE ANY MEANINGFUL AMOUNT OF ENERGY THROUGH FUSION THAT IS RATHER RARELY HAPPENING DUE TO THE LOW TEMPERATURE BUT OFTEN IN ABSOLUTE NUMBERS BECAUSE THERE'S JUST MANY PARTICLES IN IT ITER IS AIMING TO BE MUCH MORE EFFICIENT THAN THAT
SINCE COPYING A STAR ISN'T FEASIBLE BASING FUSION REACTOR CONCEPTS ON WHAT CERTAIN TYPE STARS DO DOESN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE

BESIDES NOT HAVING ACHIEVED NET ENERGY WITH PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTAL REACTORS DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING IF YOU BURN A CRUMB OF COLE YOU WON'T GET MORE ENERGY OUT OF IT THAN THE LIGHTER TOOK TO IGNITE IT IT HAS TO BURN LONGER AND MORE OF IT HAS TO BURN WITH FUSION IT'S SIMILAR PLUS THE FACT THAT WHAT LIMITS THE TIME A PLASMA CAN BURN IS HEAT LOSS WHICH IS EASIER TO ACCOUNT FOR IF YOU JUST HAVE A BIGGER DEVICE SO FAR SMALL DEVICES WERE BUILT LARGER ONES BEING MORE EXPENSIVE ITER SHOULD BE LARGE ENOUGH NOW THE ENERGY IN THE PLASMA IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE VOLUME WHILE THE HEAT LOSS IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE SURFACE AREA SO IF YOU WERE TO DOUBLE ALL DIMENSIONS THE VOLUME GROWS BY A FACTOR OF BUT THE SURFACE AREA JUST BY A FACTOR OF SO IT GETS EASIER
HE HITS UPON MOST OF THE TALKING POINTS FOR THE DEMON THOUGHT EXPERIMENT BUT DOESN'T REALLY SEEM TO HAVE ALL OF THE PIECES TOGETHER AND PROPAGATES COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS I'VE FREQUENTLY SEEN

FIRST THE MODERN NOTATION OF ENTROPY CAN'T REALLY BE CAPTURED BY SOMETHING AS VAGUE AS HOW CLOSE THE MOLECULES ARE TOGETHER IF YOU KNOW THE EXACT CONFIGURATION OF MOLECULES IN A CHAMBER THE ENTROPY OF THE COLLECTION IS ZERO AND THIS GENERALIZES TO THE QUANTUM CASE VERY DIRECTLY AS THE VN ENTROPY

SECOND LANDAUER NEVER DISCUSSED DEMON THE CONNECTION BETWEEN INFORMATION AND ENTROPY WAS REALLY MADE BY BENNETT IN

THIRDLY FOR SOME REASON EVERYONE TREATS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN PHYSICAL ENTROPY REALLY SHOULD BE CALLED GIBBS ENTROPY AND INFORMATION ENTROPY AS SOME MYSTICAL THING IT'S NOT THE SHANNON ENTROPY IS JUST THE GIBBS ENTROPY OF THE SMALLEST SYSTEM THAT CAN ENCODE SOME AMOUNT OF INFORMATION AFTER DIVIDING OUT THE BOLTZMANN CONSTANT

I'M IN THE EXTREMELY FORTUNATE POSITION OF STARTING A GRADUATE SCHEME AS A SCIENTIST I EXPECT THAT ON TOP OF LEARNING NEW SPECIFIC INFORMATION RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S NEEDS I WILL HAVE TO REMEMBER STUFF FROM MY PHYSICS MASTERS DEGREE

I'M CONCERNED ABOUT MY ABILITY TO DO THIS AFTER A REASONABLE LONG AND VERY MUCH NEEDED BREAK BETWEEN MY DEGREE ENDING AND MY JOB STARTING I FEEL MY BRAIN IS VOID OF ALL PHYSICS AND MATHS KNOWLEDGE BUT THIS IS PROBABLY TO BE EXPECTED WITH LACK OF PRACTICE AND POOR MEMORY STEMMING FROM MODERATE DYSLEXIA I HAVE A MONTH TO STUDY AFTER I COME BACK OFF MY HOLIDAY WHICH I WILL BE USING BUT I DO WORRY ABOUT FORGETTING IT WITH THE STRESSES OF A NEW JOB

SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS THIS HOW DO YOU KEEP THE BASIC RELAMENT KNOWLEDGE FROM YOUR DEGREE FRESH AND STABLE WHILE ALSO USING AND BUILDING ON IT I REALLY WANT TO DO WELL IN THIS JOB SO ANY ADVICE WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED
I AM CURRENTLY ABOUT TO BE A SENIOR PHYSICS MAJOR AND I PLAN TO APPLY TO MS PROGRAMS FOR MECHANICAL AND MATERIALS ENGINEERING WHILE I KNOW THAT PHYSICS MAJORS TRANSITIONING TO ENGINEERING IS FAIRLY COMMON I AM CURIOUS AS TO HOW POTENTIAL EMPLOYERS WOULD REACT TO SEEING A BS IN PHYSICS AS OPPOSED TO ENGINEERING ON MY RESUME

I AM HOPING SOMEONE ELSE HERE HAS FOLLOWED THE SAME PATH AS ME AND CAN COMMENT ON HOW THEIR JOB SEARCH WAS DID THE PHYSICS MAJOR HELP OR HURT YOUR ENGINEERING JOB PROSPECTS DID NOT BEING ABLE TO GET YOUR PE TRULY HURT YOU
CAN ANYONE WHO HAS DONE A CLINICAL JOB IN MEDICAL PHYSICS BY THAT I MEAN IN A RADIATION ONCOLOGY DEPARTMENT IMAGING DEPARTMENT ETC BUT THEN TRANSITIONED ELSEWHERE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE WHY YOU LEFT WHAT IT HAS BEEN LIKE SINCE YOU MOVED

THANKS IN ADVANCE
WHAT SALARY SHOULD I EXPECT FOR MY FIRST JOB AFTER GETTING MY PHYSICS DEGREE

I GRADUATED THIS SPRING WITH A PHYSICS BS AND SINCE THEN I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR JOBS I FINALLY GOT MY FIRST OFFER HOWEVER I'M WORRIED THAT THE PAY MIGHT BE MUCH LOWER THAN I SHOULD BE AIMING FOR

FOR CONTEXT I LIVE SOMEWHERE WHERE THE COST OF LIVING IS ABOUT THE NATIONAL AVERAGE THE PAY FOR THIS JOB IS IN THE MID S THOUSAND PER YEAR ONE THING TO NOTE IS THAT I AM VERY LIMITED GEOGRAPHICALLY SINCE I'M NOT GOING TO MOVE SO THAT MAY MEAN THAT I SHOULD EXPECT A LITTLE LESS PAY HOWEVER I DO LIVE IN AN AREA WITH A LOT OF UNIVERSITIES TECHNOLOGY BIOTECH MEDICINE PHARMACY ETC

I KNOW OF COURSE MY DECISION SHOULD DEPEND ON HOW MUCH I LIKE THE POSITION WHAT MY EXPENSES ARE WHAT KIND OF LIFESTYLE I WANT ETC I KNOW I'M JUST ASKING IS THIS TERRIBLE PAY FOR A PHYSICS GRADUATE
IF YOU FIND ANY ERRORS JUST PM ME FEEL FREE TO PLAY AROUND WITH IT
WOULDN'T THERE BE ETERNAL STORMS ON TIDALLY LOCKED PLANETS I WOULD THINK THAT THE TEMPERATURE DIFFERENTIAL WOULD CAUSE HUGE PRESSURE DIFFERENCES
INSERT ALIENS MEME
ON A MORE SERIOUS NOTE I HOPE THE BREAKTHROUGHINITIATIVES WILL SUCCEED AND THAT THE PLANET HAS LIFE IN MY LIFETIME THAT IS
TIDALLY LOCKED THAT'S SO FUCKING DISAPPOINTING
SOMETHING I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED WITH THESE PLANETS WOULDN'T IT BE LIKELY TO PRODUCE SPIN PERPENDICULAR TO THE PLANE OF THE SYSTEM LIKE WITH URANUS WITH THE POLE ALWAYS POINTING TO THE SUN
THERE IS A LOT OF SNOW AND ICE ON TOP OF EVEREST BUT THAT S IN THE DEATH ZONE
I IMAGINE A SCENARIO WE SUSPECT THIS PLANET MAY HOST LIFE AND POSSIBLY INTELLIGENT LIFE BUT HOW DO WE COMMUNICATE WITH THEM HOW DO WE KNOW THEY WILL BE ABLE TO RECEIVE A MESSAGE WE CAN'T NECESSARILY USE RADIO WHAT FREQUENCY DO THEY USE HOWEVER THE ABILITY TO DETECT LIGHT IS ALMOST UNIVERSAL FOR COMPLEX ORGANISMS LIVING ABOVE GROUND SURELY THEY CAN SEE WE USE MIRRORS REFLECTING LIGHT TOWARDS THIS PLANET SUCH AS THE SOLAR GLARE FARMS THAT EXIST IN THE DESERTS OF NEVADA JUST SOUTH OF LAS VEGAS WE CAN SEND A RHYTHMIC MESSAGE THAT COULD NOT BE MISTAKEN FOR AN ACCIDENT MAYBE THEY HAVE BEEN WATCHING OUR GOLDILOCKS PLANET FOR MILLENNIA LOOKING FOR SIGNS OF LIFE FINALLY THEY GET A MESSAGE AND THEY SEND ONE BACK THAT WOULD BE COOL SOMETHING LIKE A YEAR FEEDBACK LOOP
WHY NOT LEARN COMPUTER PROGRAMMING NUMERICAL SIMULATION AND NUMERICAL MODELING OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF SURFACES THIS IS ALL RELATIVELY EASY PROGRAMMING AND IT'S VERY USEFUL WORK THAT MIGHT LEAD TO PUBLICATION

TO PROVE THE DINOSAURS EXTINCTION

NOT LIKELY THE ISSUES SURROUNDING THIS THEORY CAN'T BE RESOLVED WITH A RELATIVELY SIMPLE MODEL THAT DESCRIBES WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF AN ASTEROID COLLIDED WITH EARTH THERE IS MUCH MORE TO IT THAN THAT

THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THE EXTINCTION WHERE DOUBT LIES IS IN THE EXACT SEQUENCE OF EVENTS THE RATE OF EXTINCTION AND THE APPARENT FACT THAT MANY DINOSAUR SPECIES WERE BECOMING EXTINCT BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF THE ASTEROID

CAN ANYONE HERE EXPLAIN THIS STEP THERE'S APPARENTLY SOMETHING IMPORTANT MISSING OH HE USED LAGRANGIAN FORMALISM AND GOT THIS YEAH WELL SEEING WHAT HE DID IS THE INTERESTING THING HOW IS THAT NON TENSOR MU SIGMA OF THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD EVEN DEFINED SERIOUSLY THE JUMP FROM TO IS SO HUGE THAT I WOULD THINK WHOEVER WROTE THIS PAPER HAD PROBLEMS WITH THAT STEP TOO AND JUST WANTS TO BRUSH OVER IT
THANKS FOR THE LINK TO THIS PAPER GREAT TO HAVE THIS REFERENCE

IN READING ABOUT IT I CAME ACROSS A SIMILAR ARTICLE IN PHYSICS TODAY BY MICHEL JANSSEN AND JURGEN RENN SO I THOUGHT I'D MENTION IT

CONTENT AP MAGAZINE PHYSICSTODAY ARTICLE
AT WORK NO TIME TO READ THIS BUT WOULD THIS COUNT AS A SHORT INTRODUCTION TO GR
THAT'S A VERY LOOSE DEFINITION OF SINGING
WOULDN'T IT NEED TO ORBIT ANOTHER BLACK HOLE TO PRODUCE THOSE WAVES
BLACK HOLES ARE TERRIFYINGLY AMAZING
I WONDER WHAT THE EFFECT OF SUCH A BLACK GRAVITY WOULD DO TO OUR SOLAR SYSTEM
ITS
RELATED

AUDIO RECORDINGS DOCUMENT WEIRD MUSIC HEARD BY APOLLO ASTRONAUTS ON FAR SIDE OF MOON
TO PUT THIS SIMPLY IF A MASS IS FLEXIBLE A PASSING GRAVITATIONAL WAVE WILL FLEX IT CAUSE IT TO DISSIPATE HEAT AND POSSIBLY EVEN CAUSE IT TO DISINTEGRATE IF ITS TENSILE COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH LIMITS ARE EXCEEDED

A AMPLITUDE WAVE

THIS IS NOT HOW GRAVITATIONAL WAVES ARE MEASURED GRAVITATIONAL WAVES DON'T HAVE A HEIGHT LIKE WAVES ON THE SEA INSTEAD THEY HAVE AN AMPLITUDE THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO INDUCE ACCELERATIONS IN MASSES ROUGHLY LIKE AN ELECTROMAGNETIC ABILITY TO MOVE ELECTRONS IN A CONDUCTOR

OR WOULD HIS ATOMS BE RELATIVELY UNAFFECTED BY THE MOMENTARY STRETCHING

THIS WOULD DEPEND ENTIRELY ON THE AMPLITUDE OF THE WAVES AND AMPLITUDE CAN'T BE EQUATED WITH HEIGHT AS IN YOUR EARLIER EXAMPLE
JUST TAKE THE JACOBIAN AND LINEARIZE IT AT THAT POINT
IF MY TEXTBOOKS ARE ANY INDICATION MANY PHYSICISTS HAVE HAD WIVES WHO ARE CONSTANTLY NAGGING THEM TO EXPAND IT AS A TAYLOR SERIES AND CUT OFF HIGHER ORDER TERMS
A WHILE AGO I SAW A WEBPAGE AIMED AT MATHEMATICIANS THAT WOULD JOKINGLY CREATE A NEW PHRASE EVERY TIME YOU REFRESHED THE PAGE SAYING JUST LOOK AT THE PROBLEM AS A ONE AREA OF MATHS OPERATOR OR PROCESS ANOTHER AREA OF MATHS RANDOMLY GENERATED OF COURSE IT WAS MOSTLY ALWAYS COMPLETE NONSENSE BUT HILARIOUS NONETHELESS AND SOMETIMES MADE YOU THINK I EAST JUST THINK OF IT AS A AFFINE SYMMETRY GROUP EMBEDDED IN A HYPERBOLIC TORUS OR LOOK AT IT LIKE NONCOMMUTATIVE RATIONAL FUNCTIONS PROJECTED OVER ALL MANIFOLDS OF NONPOSITIVE CURVATURE IT WAS FUNNY I WISH I COULD FIND IT BACK AGAIN
IN SOFT MATTER AND OTHER FIELDS I'M SURE WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU TAKE HYDRODYNAMICS INTO ACCOUNT
A GREAT ONE THAT WE LEARNED FROM OUR GRADUATE PROFESSOR FIRST SIMPLE THEN CORRECT IF YOU HAVE A DIFFICULT PROBLEM STRIP IT OF AS MUCH COMPLICATIONS AS YOU CAN MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A SOLID AND FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THIS BASIC AND OVERSIMPLIFIED VERSION OF YOUR PROBLEM ONCE YOU'VE DONE THAT YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE COMPLEX PROBLEM WITH A SOLID BASIS OF KNOWLEDGE AND INTUITION HELPED ME MANY TIMES
SWEET CLYDE USE VARIATION OF PARAMETERS AND EXPAND THE WRONSKIAN
HAVE YOU UNPLUGGED EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE LAB UNTIL THE NOISE WENT AWAY
DID YOU TRY USING MATPLOTLIB INSTEAD OF PIROOT
WHAT SHOULD BE HAPPENING WHY ISN'T IT

FIT IT TO A GAUSSIAN POISSON ETC DISTRIBUTION

TRY

REMOVE HARMONICS

CHECK FOR HYSTERESIS

IS IT REPRODUCIBLE

WHAT CHANGED SINCE THE LAST TEST REMEMBER NEWTON WROTE DOWN PHASES OF THE MOON AND HIS LUNCH DURING EXPERIMENTATION

TRY IT ON ANOTHER MACHINE

IS IT REPRODUCIBLE
HAVE YOU TRIED SWAPPING THE CABLES
HAVE YOU DIAGONALIZE THE PERTURBATION HAMILTONIAN IN THE DEGENERATE SUBSPACE
TAKE A BATH WELL IT WORKED FOR ARCHIMEDES
I JUST SAW A PAPER ABOUT THAT ON THE SNARXIV
LOOK AT THE SIGNAL ON THE SCOPE
THIS IS PROBABLY COMPLETELY USELESS TO YOU BUT YOUR REQUEST REMINDED ME OF IT BRIAN ENO AND PETER OBLIQUE STRATEGIES
ARE YOU AT THE ROOT N LIMIT OF NOISE

DID YOU VERIFY THE SURFACE WAS CLEAN

EH IT WAS THE FIRST DOSE OF THE DAY THOSE ARE ALWAYS WEIRD

IS IT GROUNDED OR OPEN CIRCUIT
FROM MY GROUP THE WAS GOOD BUT NOT GREAT WHEN REPORTING DATA ABOUT TO ADVISOR
DUDE CHECK YOUR ENERGY CONSERVATION
HAVEN'T DEALT WITH THAT MYSELF BUT FOR WHATEVER IT'S WORTH YOU WENT THROUGH GRAD SCHOOL YOU LEARNED THE CULTURE OF PHYSICS YOU GOT PAID TO SHOOT THINGS WITH LASERS AND YOU'LL ALWAYS HAVE THAT EVEN IF YOU GO INTO A TOTALLY UNRELATED FIELD YOU'LL STILL BE A PHYSICIST
YOU'LL SAY HI CEO OF XYZ LLC

RECOMMEND GETTING SOME SWEET BUSINESS CARDS
I CAN RUN BUT I AM NOT A RUNNER I KNOW HOW TO SWIM BUT I AM NOT A SWIMMER I LEARNED HOW TO RIDE A BICYCLE BUT I AM NOT A CYCLIST I MAY NOT ALWAYS BE SHOOTING THINGS WITH LASERS HOWEVER I AM AND WILL ALWAYS BE A PHYSICIST

IF YOU'VE ALREADY ACCEPTED THAT LABEL AS PART OF YOUR IDENTITY YOU DON'T NECESSARILY NEED TO ALWAYS BE WORKING IN THE FIELD ACTIVELY TO BE DESCRIBED BY THAT LABEL YOU STILL APPROACH SOLVING PROBLEMS FROM A PHYSICS PERSPECTIVE YOU STILL HAVE YOUR KNOWLEDGE TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE YOU STILL HAVE THE CURIOSITY ABOUT HOW THE UNIVERSE WORKS AND PERHAPS KEEP UP WITH CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FIELD ONCE IT BECOME PART OF WHO YOU ARE CAN IT EVER REALLY LEAVE YOU UNLESS YOU VOLUNTARILY RIP IT FROM YOUR IDENTITY AND RENOUNCE IT THERE ARE NO LIMITS WHEN IT COMES TO LABELS IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN ONLY HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER AND HAVE TO GIVE SOME UP TO ACCEPT NEW ONES ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A QUANTUM PHYSICIST THEY ARE QUITE GOOD AT ESCHEWING THE LAW OF THE EXCLUDED MIDDLE AND ACCEPTING SUPERPOSITIONS OF LABELS THAT ARE TRADITIONALLY MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE
LOL I'M ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH THE SAME THING I'M NEARING THE END OF MY PHD AND I'M NOT SURE WHETHER I WANT TO STAY IN ACADEMIA OR DO OTHER STUFF NON SCIENCE IT'S KIND OF CRISIS OF MOTIVATION BUT OVER THE YEARS MUCH OF MY IDENTITY HAS BEEN BUILT AROUND SCIENCE AND ME BEING A SCIENTIST AND I'M NOT SURE HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT
I ALSO SHOOT STUFF WITH THE LASER BTW
PHYSICS WORLD MAGAZINE OF THE INSTITUTE OF PHYSICS HAS A REGULAR FEATURE WHERE THEY INTERVIEW PEOPLE WHO LEFT PHYSICS TO DO SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT IT'S NOT SOMETHING I'VE DONE MYSELF BUT MANY OF MY FRIENDS HAVE

I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING IS JUST TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING WORTHWHILE THAT MAKES YOU HAPPY
CURIOUSLY I'M GOING THROUGH THE SAME SITUATION BUT IN THE REVERSE DIRECTION NEXT MONTH I'LL BE GRADUATING IN ARCHITECTURE AND WILL START TO STUDY PHYSICS IN ANOTHER COLLEGE I'M NOT SURE WHAT I'LL MAKE OF MY ARCHITECTURE DEGREE AND THAT COSTS ME A LOT BECAUSE IT WAS YEARS OF HARD WORK AND I REALLY LIKE IT AS MUCH AS I LIKE PHYSICS
BUT I GUESS IT IS LIKE U CONDMATTHEORIST SAID ONE COULD ALSO SEE THIS LESS AS A CRISIS AND MORE AN IDENTITY OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD MORE IDENTITY INSTEAD OF LOSING YOUR OLD ONE COOL WAY TO THINK
BEEN THERE DONE THAT DID UNDERGRAD IN PHYSICS MASTERS IN SCIENCE EDWARD AND I'M CURRENTLY RUNNING A THEATER AND DOING THEATER TECHNICIAN WORK BEING A PHYSICIST ISN'T ABOUT DOING PHYSICS IT'S ABOUT UNDERSTANDING HOW THE WORLD FUNCTIONS AROUND YOU YOU'LL FIND A WAY TO APPLY THE THINGS YOU'VE LEARNED TO FUTURE ENDEAVORS AND LOVE EVERY SECOND OF IT

IF ANYTHING BEING A PHYSICIST JUST MEANS YOU CHOSE TO TELL THE WORLD THAT YOUR CURIOUS
I'M NOT A THEORIST MY EXPERIENCE IS ALL ON THE SIDE OF GETTING THE MEASUREMENTS SO THE FOLLOWING IS NOT BASED OFF RIGOROUS STUDY NOR DO I KNOW THE PROPER ANSWER

HOWEVER I CAN SEE TWO KEY POINTS WHERE YOUR DESCRIPTION MIGHT NOT BE COMPLETE THAT WOULD SUGGEST RESOLUTIONS TO THE APPARENT PROBLEM

MY CONFUSION ARISES BECAUSE N AND N DO NOT COMMUTE WITH J X SO BOTH CANNOT BE MEASURED AT ONCE

WHO SAYS THAT THEY MEASURED AT THE SAME TIME THE DETECTORS ARE LARGE MULTI LAYERED INSTRUMENTS AND THEY REQUIRE A CERTAIN DEGREE OF LUCK IN ORDER TO GET A CLEAR READING THAT IS WHY STATISTICS ARE USED ALL OVER THE ANALYSIS AND WHY HIGH LUMINOSITY IS SO CRITICAL SO IT BE THAT THE VARIOUS QUANTITIES ARE MEASURED BUT NEVER IN THE SAME INTERACTION DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S RIGHT JUST THROWING OUT THERE

SECONDLY

THE PARTICLE TRACKS RECONSTRUCTED FROM THE MEASURED ELECTRICAL SIGNALS REPRESENT A FIXED NUMBER OF PARTICLES I EAST THEY ARE EVIDENCE THAT THE ASYMPTOTICALLY LATE STATE IS AN EIGENSTATE OF TOTAL PARTICLE NUMBER N AND TOTAL NUMBER N

IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE DETECTORS DO NOT AND CANNOT GIVE EITHER OF THOSE NUMBERS WITH CERTAINTY AND PRECISION AGAIN THAT'S WHY THE STATISTICAL POWER IS SO IMPORTANT WHEN LOOKING AT THE RESULTS PARTICLES THAT ARE FORMED ALONG THE AXIS OF THE BEAM LINE WILL BE UNDETECTABLE PUTTING A DETECTOR THERE WILL GET IT BURNT OUT IN NO TIME AND TWO PARTICLES FOLLOWING THE SAME PATH WILL BE INDISTINGUISHABLE INDEED EVEN SEPARATING DETECTED PARTICLES OUT INTO WHICH INTERACTION THEY OCCUR IN IS BUT THAT'S WORKED OUT WITHOUT TOO MUCH DIFFICULTY

HOPEFULLY THAT HELPS GIVEN THAT I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT J X OF A CHARGED FIELD ACTUALLY MEANS

ON YOUR POINT C

THE SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF A TRACKING DEVICE IS SEVERAL ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE HIGHER THAN THE COMPTON WAVELENGTHS OF THE PARTICLES BEING DETECTED

THE PIXEL SIZE OF THE DETECTORS VARIES THROUGHOUT THE DEVICE THERE'S LOTS OF TRADE OFFS INCLUDING COST TO BUILD THAT APPLY FOR ATLAS THEY ARE AT THE SMALLEST UM BY UM YEP NOT SQUARE WHICH IS A LOT LARGER THAN THOSE WAVELENGTHS YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THEY ARE ARRANGED IN SLANTED SPIRAL WITH A LAYER OVER THEM SPIRALLING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION SO THAT THE EFFECTIVE PIXEL SIZE IS SMALLER ONCE YOU CORRELATE FROM MULTIPLE PIXELS BUT THAT HAS IT'S OWN ISSUES

I THINK THAT WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT THERE IS THE SAME THING I WAS OUTLINING AS MY SECOND POINT THESE DETECTORS ARE NOT PRECISE ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT THE THEORETICAL LIMITS OF DETECTION AS THE PRACTICAL LIMITS ARE COARSER THAN THAT IF SO YES THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE

AND IF NOT SORRY I DIDN'T FOLLOW THE THEORY SIDE FULLY JUST TRYING TO OFFER WHAT PERSPECTIVE I CAN


PARTICLES
EFFECTS
