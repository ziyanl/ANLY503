Oh man placing you guys by region without looking at a map is hilarious. Mumbai has to be close to London right?
I'd love to sign up but my biggest fear is I'll get /u/AveLucifer and I'll never not disappoint him.
i'd be terrified to get one of the regulars who basically has encyclopedic collections of a specific genre and doesn't really wander from that genre in terms of taste, especially if that is out of my wheelhouse

*scrolls through discogs*
>4,531 items in  "category: traditional heavy metal"

*... what doesn't (s)he have?*
Shit, I probably should just wrote "I mod /r/tapekvlt, that should tell you the shit I listen to."
This thread could also be for discussion and hammering out details. This is the first time this sub has done something like this so it could all end in a fire or something cool or both.

Would love to take part though I need to sort out my discogs page first. I use Last.fm sporadically so it's not very representative of my habits unless you want to buy me another Pearl Jam bootleg or a Blondie shirt. 
I'm in! Vast majority of the time I'm here its just lurking and checking out cool new music, looking forward to being part of this, lets swap records mysterious internet strangers.

I would have loved to, but I'm already subscribed to the big redditgifts one, and I'm poor :(
Signed up for the digital tier because the Canadian dollar is ass right now 
Signed up. Forgot to include my shirt size so if anyone happens to get me I wear a medium. Haha 
Done. I included some digital releases that I bought from Amazon so that I don't get duplicates of those.

Looking forward to whatever tape or vinyl I get. Hopefully something underground that reflects my tastes. 
Signed up! Looking forward to this, I did the Reddit SS last year and it sucked... It's cool to have this here where we *all* mutually share a passion.
Welp, this gives me a good reason to finally get my discogs account up to date with all my physical release pickups.
What if I give out shitty music, or I receive shitty music?
Ok so just out of curiosity:

Are people mostly thinking of sending each other newer albums? Like stuff that just came out that they might have missed or are we not thinking any specific release date range?

Also, if somebody gives their bandcamp page for instance should we pull something off their wishlist or should we try and find something they might not have heard of?

I haven't seen any of these questions asked here so sorry if I'm repeating or something.
Sent my email, I forgot to include that I'm from the UK in my message :)
I'll do it if someone does t mind waiting until January to receive their unholy blessing since I'll be on a boat off the coast of Africa until then. 
I'm interested. For clues I might just provide a text dump of albums I have. I don't use discogs to track my collection and I also don't use last.fm. Would this be acceptable?
I wanna do the digital one (I'm poor) but I have Spotify premium. Is it a douchey move/can I ask for something not on Spotify? I just kinda see it as someone spending $10 on a recommendation.
How many aussies have signed up?
This is badass. Someone please send me a super obscure trad release.
Can this get stickied? 
How do i sign up?
I'm going to a show on Saturday with a pretty good lineup, could be the perfect opportunity to pick something up for someone...
I'm already doing the Reddit Secret Santa  ( first year doing it and I wish I had known about the metal equivalent sooner). 
SS Noob questions.

Are ~30 USD & ~10 USD orientative, or count as minimum / maximum? I mean, what if I decide to send a 15 USD physical thingie or a 20 USD digital one?

Also, I take for granted I can straight order so it gets delivered straight to my SS?

[Typical Interview with singer ROK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7UG1f-O0H8) 

If that whole thing hurt your brain watching, then it is a good place to start for Australia finest and most chaotic group of war misers, Sadistik Execution who is a band which borders on death, black, insanity, and according to the members, total shit. Do not even try to gauge your interest in this band based on this one album as the band says its shit in interviews and the prominent guitarwork is from a member who left after the completion of the record. Approaching this band is like getting closer to a crazy old persons house with the excitement of knowing he could come out that door with a shotgun at any moment. 

Sadistik Execution is many things but focused they are not. If we were looking objectively at this record, The Magus embodies Australia's extreme metal scene as an avatar of chaos. Similar to the fury and speed of Blasphemy's Fallen Angel of Doom but given much more beer and sent shrieking with laughter in the studio.  Even the band's second album *We Are Death... Fukk You!* is leagues ahead of the debut in terms of focus. While it would be more logical to go with an album that can be understood, there is something more fun about choosing chaos and I think Sadistik Execution would want it that way. 

Why are you listening to this today? Well, you are not. If you have never heard the albums [Stillbirth Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RakjJL8Kfd0&list=PLnoI4LdQSuudRXpjKUlLXrGoxIJvoJ8Bg) or [Fallen Angel of Doom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAZnHJ9-0EA) or [Vengeance War 'till Death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itmD1sP6MSo), you are going to listen to those first before jumping into the Magus. This Album of the Week is for a more discerning audience that is best enjoyed in a snifter with to inhale the aroma of gasoline while enjoying a fine cigar wrapped in newspaper. 

FUKK YES!
Xtreme kool letterz have never been kooler.   
Spelling jokes aside this is a fucking madhouse of an album, I absolutely love it.   
Always thought it summed up the australian scene pretty well. Martire & others are chasing after this album (catching up nicely, but still chasing).
Katatonia's sound has really changed since 1991.
/u/greatthunderowl felt bad about using Sepultura for the /r/deathmetal AOTW because you guys did it first. Now the tables are fukkin turned, cvnts. 
/u/AveLucifer, here's a late birthday present from the mods.
SO FUKKING GOOD. 
14 year old me fukking fell in love with these guys as soon as he heard the track "Fukking Death". I mean, what kind of kid doesn't want to hear a track open with "fukk you, fukking cunt"?

That being said, The Magus is most likely their most consistent album as far as memory serves, I'll have to revisit this one today. It's been too long
This has been sitting in my Spotify collection for awhile and hasn't been touch. I'll use this as a reason to give it a shot now.
What was the past week album?
Klassikk record. Total death insanity the way it should be.
It was good. About what you would expect of Caladan Brood covering Summoning.  Which is basically just Summoning with more depth in production. 
My heart just fucking stopped. Caladan Brood is my favorite band.

I heard talks of collaborations but I thought Caladan Brood was dead. I hope this means a new album in the future.  
CAN'T LISTEN TO THIS YET AS I'M ON TRANSIT, BUT HOLY HELL I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR THAT CHORUS WITH THE CALADAN BROOD CLEANS.

EDIT: not as good as I was hoping, I was wanting some deep, booming choirs like on BotF but still good. It really is just as everyone has said, cleaner produced Summoning.
It's great, just like their other Summoning covers.


...


...


...

New. Album. When.
Oh man, I hope this means there's a new Caladan Brood album on the horizon. I've been waiting for it with bated breath since Echoes of Battle came out.
I thought this band wasn't active any more (especially since they're off of Spotify). There's a lot more Malazan to brood about now, though, so glad to see they might be back in action.
For those who haven't realized, it's actually a [collection of Summoning covers](https://ashnazgdurbatuluk.bandcamp.com/) by other atmospheric black metal bands.
###[Antaeus – Condemnation]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_N91vrjJtM) (2016)

Some things I think may have inspired Antaeus’ new album: wood chippers; root canals; water-boarding; dial-up internet; the feeling of sitting down on a cold toilet seat. This shit is painful and unpleasant. In a good way, though, unlike all the tribulations I just mentioned. The album almost seems like the band sat down and said, “how aggressive can we make this album and still have people want to listen to it?” The album typifies aggressive black metal. Jagged, sandpaper riffs swarm around oppressive and militaristic drums. Vocals are sung halfway between a growl and a shriek. Bass….well, it pretty much matches the guitar riffs. And the riffs are excellent. Despite their dissonance and chaos, the riffs are quite catchy and memorable. The drums are quite idiosyncratic. There is an almost death-metal quality of force and violence to them. The snare drum sounds like someone is hitting it with a jackhammer when blasts begin. And the blasts are very interesting. The drummer is not content to perpetuate standard blasts, instead choosing to switch up his percussive playing in a way that constantly kept me on my toes and struggling to keep up. I find myself imagining what these musicians must have looked like after recording a song: bleeding fingers, shredded vocal chords; I don’t even want to think about what kind of shape the drummer must have been in after a performance like this.  If hyper-aggressive and kinetic black metal is what you seek, look no further than this atrocity. 

###[Manilla Road – Crystal Logic]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjXDEuT7onA&t=149s) (1983)

Am I ever glad I decided to dive into straight up heavy metal. I’m not even sure how to laud this album properly it is so good. There is not one second of wasted space on the album; it is head-to-toe legit. Every instrumental performance on the album is great, but the clear all-star of these proceedings is Mr. Mark Shelton. This guy is an animal. His riffs are all bone shatteringly powerful and as propulsive as a bullet train. Though in his leads he tends to shred to his heart’s content, he possesses the masterful—and enviable—skill of *tasteful* shredding. It never feels like he is showing off just to show off, even in moments where he goes manic like the intro to Flaming Metal Systems (which apparently is not on all versions of this album..?) or The Ram. Then there are his vocals. In general, he maintains a conversational and nasal lilt that makes me think of a wizened old professor or a wizard. But then there are other times like [this]( https://youtu.be/CPAYS-jMyVc?t=217) where his vocals shatter the fucking firmament. He displays a liquid, mercurial vocal performance that is truly awe inspiring. Though I’ve extoled Shelton up to this point, the other players are no slouches. The drumming is groovy, solid, and punchy. The bass is generally pretty great throughout the album, too. Most of the time it is a subtle presence, working its way around the other instruments, until the ending solo section of Dreams of Eschaton when the bass lays down one of the great basslines I’ve ever heard. I’m shocked and appalled that I never listened to this album, but oh so happy I have now. 

###[Riot – Thundersteel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lxc-zIQJQE&t=1s) (1986)

LET ME TELL YOU—WHY AM I YELLING? OH, WELL THE REASON IS TWOFOLD: 1) I TURNED THIS ALBUM UP WAY TOO LOUD AND NOW I CAN’T HEAR SHIT; AND 2) I JUST LISTENED TO THIS ALBUM AND I’M PUMPED UP. THUNDERSTEEL IS EXACTLY HOW ONE WOULD EXPECT AN ALBUM CALLED THUNDERSTEEL TO BE. IMAGINE HOW AN ALBUM CALLED THUNDERSTEEL SHOULD SOUND. THAT’S HOW IT SOUNDS. OK, I think this gimmick has run its course. This thing is chock full with thick heavy-metal riffing, screaming guitar leads, insanely urgent drums, and heroic air-raid siren vocals that will destroy any resolve you have to resist the album’s majesty. The whole thing is pretty much go, go, go right from the start. It is rare that Riot extends the listener a break from the intensity, speed, and power. There are only a couple (relatively) slower numbers, namely, *Sign of The Crimson Storm*, *Bloodstreets*, and (to a certain extent) *Buried Alive*. The rest of the album is a quasi-speed metal masterpiece with a lot of variety in the lyrical topics, though they all have a bit of an epic tinge to them, from the battle-hardened anthem *Fight or Fall*, to the deity-worshipping title track, to the Rip Van Winkle reminiscent *Johnny’s Back*. The drum performance is one of the finest I’ve heard in all of heavy metal and is strangely consistent for two different drummers playing across the record. A lot of aspects of this album remind me of *Painkiller*, right down to the title track being about a superhero saving humanity. Although, I suppose *Painkiller* would remind me of this album, since it came out later. But for fans of one, I bet you will love the other. THUNNNNNDERRRRRSTEEHEEEEHEEEL. 

###[Sumerlands – Sumerlands]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYvjaVO4ws8&t=1410s) (2016)

The riff factory is open for business, and sales are at an all-time high. I feel I can’t properly describe this album because I was so mesmerized by the incredible riffery (riffage? Let’s go with riffery). This album is stacked top to bottom with all the great riffs you thought were lost in the eighties—but they’re not! They’re here! The sound is reminiscent of 80’s Priest, Ultimate Sin-era Ozzy, and even [Van Halen]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuyvT8nFMLY). I was routinely stunned and surprised by the consistent excellency displayed among the tracks. I thought, This has to end soon. No way these guys can keep this up. But they do, and it’s glorious. Again, I feel I can’t describe the album properly outside the riffs. But if there was a vocalist, though there would be nothing flashy about his performance, it would be a manly, reverb-drenched shout that fits the music well. I’m not even sure if there were drums on the album, on account of my aforementioned riff-transfixion, but if there were drums, they would be easy to miss but actually excellent. They would serve to augment the guitars, but easily stand on their own as a top-notch drum performance. *Sumerlands* pretty much consistently sticks to the same mode until the wispy, synth-fantasy closer, which provides one with a cigarette after the previous climax of an album. Have you guys listened to this album? No? Listen to this album. I’m not kidding. Did you like it? You didn’t? Are you feeling OK? I think we’re growing apart. I don’t even know you anymore. I think it’s time we went our separate ways. 

###[Vastum – Patricidal Lust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQuIy3KWpRw) (2013)

Yuck. Just Yuck. This album is disgusting. Downright filthy. And I like it. You will, too. About 40 minutes of lascivious, slow-march death metal. I believe Vastum would qualify as Cavernous Death metal for those of you counting. All of the songs hover around 5-7 minutes, and there are only six of them, so the album doesn’t overstay it’s welcome. Though by the end, you may find yourself wishing you were wading through it’s sordid filth for a bit longer. I hate the word “crushing” to describe music. It’s overused, it’s lost all meaning. But I’m going to go ahead and say that if any band deserves the qualifier “crushing,” it’s Vastum. These riffs are heavier than hell. And in addition to their heaviness, they are *catchy*. Like, stuck in your craw for hours catchy. There are two vocalists, and I’m not sure who does what, but the vocals alternate between low, barrel-chested grunts, and midrange roars that complete the atmosphere of prurient darkness. All of the lyrics are about various abstract, philosophical sexual acts, or just straight up STD’s. You won’t know it unless you’re looking at a lyric booklet, but take it from me: they are graphic. If you love slow caverndeath, you’ll love this, but be warned: you may find yourself destroying various objects around your dwelling with the strangest erection…. 

**Lord Vigo**

Sometimes straight epic doom, sometimes a bit too twisted, gnarled and just plain fucked to really fit that category. Great stuff that bodes well for their first full-length, due in January. 

["Vigo Von Homburg Deutschendorf"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r3njv50HMk) - from *Under Carpathian Sun* EP ('15)

["Terror Witchcraft"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c_41TsXIXY) - from *Under Carpathian Sun* EP ('15)

----------------

**The Rubes**

Sorta like Humble Pie mixed with Man's Ruin stoner rock guitar tone/riffs and the former's killer, soulful vocals that really stand out from the norm. They only recorded one album, but the whole thing is online along with a boatload of bonus cover songs:

[*Hokum*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOgad_EScGs) ('02)

----------------

**F.C.D.N. Tormentor**

Totally out of control blasting L.A. thrash that slowed down quite a bit by the time they finally put out a 7", although there's one total ripper on it (and you can probably guess which song is linked below). A couple of archival releases are on the horizon, although one of those puts "1982-1985" in the title and "sessions re-recorded in 2015" in the description, so ...

["Disciple"/"Axe of the Priest"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lRFa-AnD4M) - from *Demonic* demo ('86)

["Eternal Grave"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaHUTn5HD1k) - from *F.C.D.N.* 7" ('91)
[**Lady Killer** - ***Lady Killer***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXoy-_3mAeQ) (1983) - This is some fast and energetic heavy metal and even though it has pretty much all the requisite parts for a solid album, it came across to me as just kind of generic. It's loud and blustery, full of inventive riffs, and has plenty of decent tracks, but there just wasn't a whole lot memorable to it as far as I could tell. And based on how well received this album is, at least based on Youtube ratings, I feel like I *should* have liked this album. But for whatever reason, it just didn't stick. Check out ["Waste No Time"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naE2U7maBjs) for a sample of what their sound is like. If you can dig this track, you'll probably like the rest.

[**Lord** - ***Big City Lights***](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRfaLgR31XghCb5GVu9ZJ01NLiHdtYbzB) (1985) - Lord are a rather prolific Hungarian heavy metal band that formed in the early seventies but wouldn't release a full-length album till this one. This is some super melodic stuff drenched in keyboards and filled with an endless supply of crunchy riffs and vocal hooks. There is a strong Boston influence on one (1) track in particular (["Mesedal"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSGxSDUWf14)), but that's not really characteristic of most of the songs here. This entire album is literally made of earworms and even though the production is squeaky clean and overly poppy in places, I can't shake how enjoyable the compositions are. I think when it comes to Hungarian metal there is lots of better stuff out there, but that doesn't knock this at all, especially if you like hard rock/heavy metal hybrids like I do. I can't imagine a lot of you liking this, but I don't care because this is a great find for me. I'm looking forward to getting into their later stuff.

[**Lynx** - ***Caught in the Trap***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BssxLX-p88Y) (1985) - Here is some insanely fat heavy metal from Sweden. I had heard this band before, but never played through an entire album. This is super sweet heavy metal, and it seems like it was tailor-made just for people like me. Just about every song has those [slow, punchy riffs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtz8zdp7v2M) that I love interlaced with competent yet unassuming vocals. Not all songs fit into that particular framework, but even the ones that don't are still exceedingly strong, leaving the album completely devoid of filler in any sense. It's rare that I come across an album this strong, so this is definitely making it into my regular rotation. It's still too early to tell, but I wouldn't be surprised if this one ended up as one of those enduring classics that I spin for years to come.

[**Lazy** - ***Creature***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yGQ2vzn7cg) (1984) - Another Swedish band with the same knack for [those infectious riffs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aveLi5Mbezc) that I go chasing after. The production is good overall, but it actually does suffer from being ever-so-slightly *too* low-fi in places. The bass is really too understated in the mix and especially given the heavy and bombastic nature of their riffs, would really do well for a makeover. But even with that complaint, the total package here is so good that I feel like I'm nitpicking. The raw delivery just happens to work amazingly well for all those [slow and punchy riffs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47qmYEPTv-Q). Another incredible find right here.

* * *

Wow, after [a dismal set of *K* albums last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/5d8qxw/whyblt_what_have_you_been_listening_to/da2nssp/), I have the exact opposite problem this time: I actually can't pick a winner here. I have no problem labelling Lady Killer as the clear loser, though. To sum up, if you like heavy metal you might as well go ahead and look into both of the Swedish albums; both are equally strong and quite similar in approach. These are strong contenders for my vinyl collection if they hold up over the next year or so. If you are like me and also like heavy metal/hard rock, definitely check out Lord's debut and if you like that, I understand from others that the next few albums are also quite good.
So since I got back from holidays I've been seriously tightening up my diet and increasing my running to 4 times a week in the lead up to summer (Down Undah). As a result, last week I actually kinda crashed in a physical, emotional and mental low point and I totally didn't figure out it was from calorie deficit until lately.

Anyway, point being, is I thought it was just me going through some emotional shit, so I tried ro compensate by listening to a lot of upbeat, fun music. Of course that exists in metal, but this fortnight my WHYBLT is pretty skewed away.

#New Retro Wave#

The 80s synth worship. I've been jamming a lot of VHS Glitch; [their album Evil Technology](https://youtu.be/YAalmHeAfe4) is fun and high energy, whilst [Halloween Strangers](https://youtu.be/JO29ROFQmT8) is more dark and spooky, like a John Carpenter film.

Speaking of the legend, there is a NRW tribute album to John Carpenter theme music which is amazing, and the NRW bandcamp has a whole bunch of compilations for free purchase to give an idea of new artists.

[Denovomutans](https://youtu.be/7A9umgY1_YI) is another artist fitting neatly into the Terminator, urban cyber synth style. Love it.

#[Jorn Lande and Russell Allen](https://youtu.be/9uw1G4hC3Us)#

Jorn was always my favourite contributor to Avantasia albums, with the sexiest whiskey-tinged voice in metal. These albums dont quite pack the same punch as Avantasia, but as a massive Symphony X fan as well, I adore hearing these two croon over 4 albums of music.

#Easycore Pop-Punk#

Before I'm escorted out of the hall, I have to admit that the biggest, easiest way to restore both my energy levels and a shit-eating grin is by playing some pop-punk with an extra heavy bounce to it. I will note that I tend to hate anything that veers to close to thinking it's metal (Asking Alexandria, Of Mice and Men), and like my pop-punk and metal like chocolate and peanut butter: fucking entirely separate.

A Day To Remember have always been one of my favourite bands, and [I'm digging their new album](https://youtu.be/b3YxLoGhDIc). [Four Year Strong returned](https://youtu.be/esCjADNzOy8) with a catchy one last year, but I also discovered recently Chunk! No Captain Chunk and Neck Deep, the latter of whom has the most fucking [catchy song ever written about Indiana Jones, Kali Ma](https://youtu.be/wElVp9HzCt8).

#Metallica#

Seeing them fucking referenced on every MetalSucks or Metal Hammer article, I decided to revisit their old albums. I always loved Ride the Lightning, but I still feel most of their other albums are nothing special, even if most tend to have a few killer tracks amongst the filler.

[However, I listened to St Anger for the first time](https://youtu.be/58-AndGTKy0), and I really like it. I listen to a lot of slam and brutal death, so the snare drum sound was FINE to me. The production was very muddy, messy and loud, but I vastly prefer that to the rather sterile and neatly executed Hardwired production. James' vocals are a lot more unpolished, he loses tone, cracks his voice, and I love it. As opposed to Hardwired where the only time I feel anything is in Spit Out The Bone. There's obvious NuMetal grooves in some songs, but considering the time it came out in, I thought it was a fantastic album. Probably my second favourite Metallica after RtL.
**METAL**

**[Necromorbid - El Dîa De La Bestia (2016, Italy, Blackened Death Metal)](https://caligarirecords.bandcamp.com/album/el-dia-de-la-bestia)**

My goodness does this album rule, and [LOOK AT THAT FUCKING ALBUM COVER](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0115752081_10.jpg). A goat with a sword! Notre Dame and nasty spear wielding demons! Phew - be still my beating heart. And the music: Imagine an unrelenting blackened death metal assault not unlike Archgoat and Black Witchery. Necromorbid lean slightly more on the black side of the fence, taking a book out of Marduk’s militaristic snare tactics. It is still death metal though - chunky riffs pop up now and again to break the assault. Given the track record of this genre, you might expect a less refined production style. Not so here. Everything is crisp and clear, yet satisfyingly warm enough to shake the fear of Nuclear Blastisms. 

For me this might be top ten material. It is a short, punchy album that lends itself to whole listens (maybe because the download is two long songs akin to a tape rip). Although nothing new, it is an exceptionally well crafted take on the genre that pulls no punches. I find myself continually returning for more, even if they sing about Satan too much. 


**[Antaeus - Condemnation (2016, France, Black Metal)](https://antaeusofficial.bandcamp.com/album/condemnation)** 


[*Someone* likes playing snare drums very fast.](http://www.lovethisgif.com/uploaded_images/7844-Animal-Reigns-Over-The-Drums.-All-Hail-timmmmyboy-s-Kermit-....gif)

 I’ll admit that on first listen this album was a real struggle. Having no experience with this band beyond hearing the name a few times and of their fearsome reputation... It felt like charging in to battle with nothing but my undies. The album just does not let up - to describe it as oppressive is an understatement. It is intent on beating you senseless, on fracturing your mind. It is terrifying. 

 Once you get over the fact that the drummer is basically a demon high on coke, there’s a lot to take in. This is hateful, spiteful music that is truly uncomfortable; not unlike sitting on a drawing pin for prolonged periods of time. No you may not go to the bathroom class has just started. 

The opening track, [*Shadow Fires*](https://antaeusofficial.bandcamp.com/track/shadow-fires), sets the tone for the the album. It is a hurricane of blast beats and classic black metal riffing with roaring vocals that are presumably saying something very angry. I feel another Marduk comparison coming on here, though Antaeus are more intent on sinister atmosphere than tank worship. Songs like the title track and [*End Of Days*](https://antaeusofficial.bandcamp.com/track/end-of-days) lean heavily on the Mayhem school of riffing, though there’s some atonal passages similar to Deathspell Omega. The overall sound of the album is cloying and dense, though not without clarity. The instruments can be heard clearly, and even though the snare drum is *relentless* it never feels purposeless.


For fear of further embarrassment I’ll stop trying to describe what more or less everyone already knows about black metal. What I will say, though, is this: Despite it’s oppressive, exclusionist nature, *Condemnation* is ultimately compelling. You may not get it at first, but sit with it a few times and it starts to sink in. Well, that, or your head explodes. 


**[Deathstorm - Blood Beneath The Crypts (2016, Austria, Thrash)](https://deathstorm.bandcamp.com)**

I’m loathe to make the link to a certain inanimate puppet percussionist, but this band demand it. Just listen to [this](https://deathstorm.bandcamp.com/track/splendid-mutilation) and you’ll see. Deathstorm play snotty, hyperactive thrash in the vein of early Slayer and Kreator. The riffs are infectiously hyper, the drumming is unhinged and sloppy, the vocals are furious. But it works, and across the eight tracks presented on this album there’s never a dull moment. 

The sheer enthusiasm of this band is intoxicating. Listening through, you notice mistakes and tempo irregularities and off the cuff solos. But it doesn’t matter. Deathstorm tear on through, raising the finger at your stupid expectations. If you are looking for thrash that actually sounds like it’s namesake, Deathstorm have your back. 



**A Few other things that I’ve not had as much time to listen to:**

A welcome return from the Peruvian death metal masters. I’ve only had the chance to listen through a couple of times but initial impressions are positive. The opening track, *[Angel Of Apostasy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUx143Bw77g)*, is classic Mortem - thrashy, old school death metal. Think Possessed meets early Morbid Angel. 


**[Attacker - (Sins Of The World, 2016, US, USPM)](https://metalonmetalrecords.bandcamp.com/album/attacker-sins-of-the-world)**

Truly epic USPM from the masters. Expect the usual - killer riffs, soaring vocals, catchy choruses. Silly intros. 


**[Vacivus - Rites Of Ascension (2015, UK Cavernous Death Metal)](https://goatprayerrecords.bandcamp.com/album/rite-of-ascension)**

FFO: Cruciamentum, Grave Miasma etc. While not startlingly original, Vacivus are still compelling enough to warrant listening to. They manage to capture that distinctly British cavernous sound.

**[Peter Gabriel - So (1986, UK Pop/World)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6BesY5Doec&list=PL7ALt1L4ZhgOFm8qJQ1-BJx0jToVjDGR-)**

Because [Sledgehammer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkiqTmwEQ-U&list=PL7ALt1L4ZhgOFm8qJQ1-BJx0jToVjDGR-&index=2). If you like 80’s era Genesis but prefered that they stayed artsier, this album’s for you. I mean, it has panpipes and Kate Bush. 

**[Sex Pistols - Never Mind The Bollocks, Here’s The Sex Pistols (1977, UK, Punk)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvXRj0VQzN4&list=PLZeQC7DpBTwSOnyrUaX5wCluLzCGGQDUX)**

Classic punk rock. Feels good to blast this now and again. 

**[Massive Attack - Mezzanine (1997, UK, Trip Hop)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlv2dV7dnnw)**

Undeniably a cornerstone of the genre. Granted most of it is hard to listen to because of it’s ubiquity, but I believe there’s an otherworldly experience to hearing *Angel* in a dark room through headphones. It reminds me of living in Bristol (UK), of hearing bass resonate through walls at 5am with the sun just rising.

[**Next Month in Power Metal (December Previews)**](http://hollywoodmetal.com/2016/11/30/bandcamp-power-metal-roundup-10/) -- One awesome traditional heavy metal, one decent power metal band with cool artwork, and one band that is doing The Elder Scrolls in a concept album don't tell /u/doedanzee because he will come in and tell me that game sucks and Ill get angry and go mine ore to make weapons so I can take out my frustrations. 

[**Hammerfall - Built to Last**](http://hollywoodmetal.com/2016/11/09/hammerfall-built-last-2016/) -- Yep here it is. The new Hammerfall record. Maybe it will be a new course in power metal and something that breaks...wait...no here is the new Hammerfall record. 

[**Metallica**](http://hollywoodmetal.com/2016/11/26/metallica-hardwired-self-destruct-2016/) -- Oh look another asshole on the internet has something to say about the new Metallica album. Maybe I just want Mom and Dad to stop fighting and us to finish dinner. 

#Spice

[**Maltheist**](http://tapewyrmmetal.com/archives/2017) (2016) -- Holu shit Portland and the West Coast, just chill on how many bands you are putting out. Culturally charged death / grind that doesn't date themselves immediately after putting out a record. Harrowing vocals and obnoxious guitars. 

[**A.S.M**](http://tapewyrmmetal.com/archives/2021) (2016) -- Holy shit Virginia Bestial black/death. This is a really fun demo if you want the sound of a concrete block hitting bone.

[Everything Else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34Na4j8AVgA&index=1&list=PLrXaSPwQl7lLdHOVXZOMI52ZezYkV659w) -- This is my popular music playlist I update throughout each month for my wife and I who want to keep up with what the kids are listening too. This month has been dominated by "Starboy" which is catchy as hell. People are saying it is a grand step in terms of style but everything since their 2011 mixtapes like House of Balloons and Thursday have been moving towards this. Plus their appearance on everything popular for the last 3 years was working to this point. Justice track is cool despite the stupid name. Im too old to like Sleigh Bells and Chainsmokers. CRX sounds like Ghost without the occult garb. Bayonne is awesome and sounds like Department of Eagles. Sad13 is cool and throws back to early 90's alt rock without being a cartoon. Empire of the Sun is MGMT I am sure of it. [A Tribe Called Quest](https://media.giphy.com/media/ifxLK48cnyDDi/giphy.gif). I do not really get Childish Gambino and find his cult following suspicious because it seems like a bunch of people who don't listen to hip hop wrap their arms around him. 
**[Hella - Hold Your Horse Is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWqLiy9TLdg)**

This is the band that Zach Hill was in before Death Grips. It's some really good math rock, with the guitar and the drums going at it in perfect sync. Really good stuff.

**[Dead Congregation - Graves of the Archangels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaTKrSQfMsQ0)**

It's finally clicked, and I can finally enjoy Dead Congregation in all its glory. Listening to the whole album in one sitting is really the only way to go about this. I will still say that Martyrdoom is way too long but it does do a very good job of creating this very foreboding feeling that leads into Hostis Humani Generis very well.

**[Tales of Medusa - The Fatal Wounding Gaze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0q87QNC7O8)**

Trad is something I don't really delve into unless it's recommended by some of the regulars on this sub, and this is one of those bands. Fantastic riffs, fantastic performances, such a shame that there'll never be any re-issues or new material.


Metallica - Hardwired... To Self-Destruct: This album caught me by surprise. I am so used to writing off Metallica. I hated St. Anger, and didn't pay attention to Death Magnetic until recently. It was decent, definitely a bit of a return to form, but didn't really make a big impression. I have to admit some of the songs on this album kicked my ass. Overall I'd say half of it is filler and half is very good Metallica with influences spread out throughout their career (luckily none from St. Anger). IMO, if they had made 1 album with Hardwired, Atlus Rise!, Now That We're Dead, Moth Into Flame, Halo On Fire, and Spit Out The Bone, they'd have had a killer album.

Freedom Call - Master of Light: This album was a disappointment for me. I really loved their last album, Beyond. I thought it was one of the best in their career and thought they'd be able to carry their success forward, but this is definitely a return to more standard *decent* Freedom Call. Good enough for a fan, I do enjoy it, but not something I'd recommend to people.

Epica - The Holographic Prinicple: I kind of wrote off this album after giving it a couple listens, but decided to give it a closer look. I'm glad I did, there's some good songs here. I still need to give it a few more listens to find them all, but I'm digging Edge of the Blade and Beyond the Matrix. Its a double album so a bit much to take in.

Unfathomable Ruination - Finitude: I'm not sure why I've been giving this album so many listens. I'm not big on brutal death metal, but Angrymetalguy.com liked it and my tastes sort of usually but not always line up theirs. I also just wanted to give a dense death metal album a try since it's been a while. But after about 5 listens, I still just can't get into it. There are moments I enjoy, some good riffs. But overall I can't find a single song that stands out, or even a single melody or moment that I can recall. Maybe with more listens. Or maybe I should just give up on this kind of music, but I don't like that idea.
[Scorched - Echoes of Dismemberment](https://youtu.be/B49U-RGflnI) 

Fucking WOW dude. Absolutely crushing and out of left field, didn't expect this at all. Pure Autopsy/Vastum worship, so much so that it's like having a faster 4th Vastum album. Haha pure fucking crushing riffs along with fantastic drumming by the dude from Homewrecker. Favorite song would have to be Dealings of a Gruesome Kind. I mean it's LITERALLY A VASTUM SONG ALMOST. God this album is so good. 

[Archagathus - Canadian Horse](https://youtu.be/e1MEkNNlp-Y) 

Goofy, but very very strong mincecore in the vein of Agathocles. Some punk ass riffs on here as well as unique vocals that you don't hear much in grind/mince. Album cover also rules. 

[Void Meditation Cult - Utter the Tongue of the Dead](https://youtu.be/kjyXiQXe5Ow) 

People who know me know I won't shut up about this album. And for good reason, it's the best Black release of the year. Beherit/Demoncy worship to the max and God is it fucking filthy. Not only does it have some of the most unique vocals in the genre, reminiscent of a more cavernous sounding Dagon, THERE'S GOD DAMN WHISPER VOX. Hail Whisper vox. 

[Nyogthaeblisz - Terroristic Onslaught of Humanicidal Chaos](https://youtu.be/cyptTqOVspU) 

POSERS NEED NOT LISTEN. Absolute sonic onslaught from these dudes. Every release is beyond insane and most physically hurt to listen to. One of the most unique takes on the Blasphemy sound, completely warping it and making it their own. 


**Grave Digger – Knights of the Cross**

Grave Digger is one of those bands I've been meaning to check out since I've heard that they're one of the non-wimpy eupm bands from what I've heard people say. The best way I can describe this album would be it sounds like Glory to the Brave with a raspy vocalist. Speaking of vocals, like I said they're mainly in this raspy singing style reminiscent of Running Wild and along with that there's also thase clean melodic singalong parts that kinda feel forced but they don't ruin the album for me. The riffing here is also good, not the most amazing but good. And here comes my main issue with Knights of the Cross, there isn't much variety with some songs feeling like filler.


**Katatonia – Brave Murder Day**

Around 5 weeks ago I gave my thoughts on Dance of December Souls, which I loved. After that I didn't really listen to any Katatonia until this was featured as the AOTW last week, which prompted me to listen to this album. And I love it, not sure if I prefer this or December Souls though. 

**Cult of Luna & Julie Christmas – Mariner**

I used to be really into Cult of Luna in autumn last year, well their first three albums anyway since I never got around to checking them out besides those afformentioned three albums. But around february this year I lost interest in them but I regained some interest in them around the same time this album came out in early april, but I never got around to checking this album out until recently. And I found this to be a great album, definitly going in my top 5 albums of the year. 
The vocals here are way better than on any other CoL album. While their usual hardcore-influced shouts are still here, which I find to be the weakest part as always with Cult of Luna since I think they're just okay if not a bit boring. But Julie's vocals here are amazing, easily the best part of this album. And there's also male cleans provided by the members of the band, which are also great. Other than that the songwriting is great, since that has always been their strong point.

[Krallice - Ygg Huur](https://krallice.bandcamp.com/album/ygg-huur)

One of those bands sitting perpetually on the peripheral of my listening that I never really got round to properly hearing. Decided to start here mainly because of the weird off-kilter artwork, but from the descriptions/brief encounters I've had with the band before, it's probably fair to say this is a fairly good representation of their sound. It's a jarring, angular tremolo-picked approach to black metal that is forever twisting and falling on itself - no surprises that it brings to mind Gorguts occasionally considering Marston's role in both.

[Urfaust - Apparitions](https://urfaust.bandcamp.com/album/apparitions)

Picked this up on whim/bandcamp binge. A four-track release that really shows off this strange doomy black metal band really immerses itself in the more ambient side of things, even going so far to close up with a 20 minute dark and brooding ambient track that can be really quite oppressive. A real interesting listen, worth it alone for the haunting title track, perhaps not as immediate as their album works but still a worthwhile listen.

**Summoning - Minas Morgul**

While I've not quite got through all Summoning has to offer yet, this has been the album of theirs that I've enjoyed the most. I'm not sure what about it was different, but it seemed to me to come across as more epic than the others. [Lugburz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtb53WAg3ws) and [Dagor Bragollach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy1Y3LAmqpo) stand out to me in this regard.

**King Goat - Conduit**

For some reason I've never gotten around to listening to much doom metal but this caught my eye for some reason and I just gave it a shot. Really glad I did as I found myself enjoying the album a hell of a lot. Nothing about it was particularly outstanding but everything seemed very solid without really any weak points.

**Metallica - Hardwired...To Self-Destruct**

While I didn't have the highest expectations, this album certainly managed to exceed them. I expected a mediocre album with a few stand out tracks but got a very solid album that could have potentially been fantastic if they were slightly better at self editing. Removing 2 or 3 songs of the second disk could have prevented the album from dragging at the end. The riffs were well written, the drumming was passable and the singing was fantastic. It's certainly no Master of Puppets but I would be fine with a few more albums like this.

**Agalloch - The Mantle**

I don't have too much to say about this but it's certainly in my top 3 favorite albums of all time and seems to fit the cold season. I really enjoy the distinct feel of (most) of the songs on this album as well as the use of some instruments (or sounds made with a keyboard, I'm not sure which) that I wouldn't usually expect to find in metal that help prevent any parts of the album being a drag. [The Hawthorne Passage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DKw2d3ir5U) and [In The Shadow of Our Pale Companion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pmwndD2EOw) are my favorite songs of the album.

On a slightly less metal note, I've found myself managing to get into a few dungeon synth albums which wasn't something I wasn't expecting. **Lord Lovidicus - Book of Lore - Vol.1** [favorite track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0G2L7iRgas) and **Erang - Within the Land of my Imagination I am the Only God** have kept me entranced within whatever book I happen to be reading/aided me greatly with procrastinating about my personal statement.
Sabaton - the lion from the north 

I'm a fan of heavy, fast guitars, but most metal is awesome. what I particularly like about this song and band is they stick to explaining historical events, while making their songs powerful, aggressive, and really great choruses. 

found the band through an r/videos post of a live performance of 40:1, was hooked immediately  

**[Khemmis - Hunted](https://open.spotify.com/album/3u16EqmIewkFrJLvGQFVmL)** - Everything about this album makes me feel good. The riffs are huge and heavy and never feel clichéd, the clean vocals are thick and meaty, the growled vocals are used for impact when things get rough not just strewn about, and until just now I barely noticed the rhythm section it was just there somewhere driving ahead. If someone had asked me to describe what I thought a great album was I'm not sure I could have described this but this is one of my favorites this year. Even my wife loves the album, so bonus points there for digestibility.

**[Vader - The Empire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyq7og1Jnzs)** - This is really great Death/Thrash that had me from the opening riff. One thing I noticed is that Vader doesn't insist on a breakneck pace, unlike a lot of recent Thrash that I enjoy, there's a comfortable mix of speed and groove. The guitars are thick but clear and the vocals have a barked quality that jumps out at you. On tracks like _Prayer to the God of War_ and _Iron Reign_ they mix in raspy vocals to give some depth and a creepy vibe. Short track lengths, a variety of riffs, and consistent quality makes it hard to turn off. Actually if anyone read this far I wouldn't mind some earlier Vader recommendations.

**[Dark Tranquillity - Atoma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suhuQlYZwtE)** - I've been finding a lot of Melodeath(?) that I like this year. Clean vocals on top of screamed/rasped vocals on top synth on top of buzz saw guitar on top of synth on top of drums with all of these things moving constantly. The album opens with a grandiose fast paced song that does a good job of letting you know what you're in for. By the time you get to _Forward Momentum_ the band is a bit more comfortable slowing down and letting you enjoy the synth. The rest of the album bounces back and forth between fast/soaring and slow/atmospheric. I think there are a lot of opportunities to screw up pacing or put in complexity where you don't need it and these guys did a great job never making you feel like they were playing out of place or trying too hard.

**Not Metal**

**[The Black Queen - Fever Daydream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLMbFoYzXgY)** - Greg from The Dillinger Escape Plan has an electronica side project. Some nice head bobbing poppy electronic music if you're into those things. I think I have a man crush on Greg.

**Stupid Rant**

I've been doing my best to learn how to record myself on my home computer. MIDI drums scare me, I have horrible latency when recording and splitting the output to my desk speakers, I've only ever written 2 riffs that were worth a damn and I've already used them in this track. As part of my effort to actually get myself to record some things I've stepped out of my comfort zone a little bit so I don't try to copy all the tracks I know really well, because I'm a derivative piece of trash. It's a fun process and I'm enjoying it but I'm really bad at it. /rant
[IHBLTTNWAITIPA]
**Keith Merrow—The Arrival**

An instrumental technical death metal album with riffs that sound like Meshuggah if Meshuggah used riffs that were more than 4 notes. There's also atmospheric breaks and solos that remind me very much of something you'd hear on Death's *Human* album. I have not heard technical death metal with riffs this weird/good since Gorguts' *Obscura*. Hard to believe this was made by one guy. [The opening track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SO57athXbVM) and "[Pillars of Creation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cpKat5fiyM)" are really all you need to understand this album.
____
[**Crimson Massacre—The Luster Of Pandemonium**](https://deathgasmrecords.bandcamp.com/album/the-luster-of-pandemonium)

Moar technical death metal with bizarre riffing à la *Obscura*. The production holds this one back a lot, because the guitars are sort of "hidden". You can still make out the riffs, and they are very weird.
WHYBLT? MIGHT ASWELL JUST FUCKING SPELL IT OUT WHEN IT GETS THAT BIG

MAWJSIOWIGTB
A Scar for the Wicked
Canadian death metal. 
Seen them live a couple times, bought their ep. A mix of Black Dahlia, Lamb, and Sepultera.  Great live bad. Crazy good lead guitarist and drummer. Awesome sound. Check them out. 
https://asftwband.bandcamp.com
Disarmonia Mundi is criminally underrated 
I agree great band

Essentials
I have a Nihilist patch on my vest. 
There is also a band called Revel In Flesh, Thrash as fuck yeah \m/
i played in some crust and hardcore bands when i lived in japan and they all loved nihilist. i remember when the comp came out in like 2004 and every disk union was playing it on repeat lol
Total anthem when they play this live. Solid dudes and solid jams. Love bugging them about Terminal every chance I get. Love em.
One of the best bands round at the moment! I know what I'm listening to now 
Great song and great album. Love this band.
Shockingly good live band too. These guys should really be opening for Iron Maiden or Judas Priest.
Man, I haven't heard of these guys in years. I was into their debut album for a very brief moment when I first heard it before finding the throwback conceit wore very thin very quickly. Most bands going for a throwback sound/style at least add something, whereas I found these to be such a complete pastiche that - whilst admittedly very well-executed - I lost interest very quickly.
Even though its a great song, it still doesn't hold a candle to [stellar plains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MAA7ctr6AY)
Noice
Coming from Precambrian, this album (and the next, Anthropocentric) was a major letdown. It has some stand-out songs and moments, but it lost the hard edge I appreciated in their earlier work.

Pelagial did a lot to soothe that disappointment. Still waiting for another song like [Tonian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEAmQVY6DQE).
Angels Cry is definitely their most celebrated album, though personally I prefer Temple of Shadows and Rebirth. From what I've seen in the states, Carry On is generally Angra's "anthem" so to speak.

It'll be interesting to see what other folks say, but I wouldn't say that Wuthering Heights immediately comes to mind when I think of Angra. Great song though, I almost always enjoy covers.
That cover was something I would always skip because it didn't sound interesting. But when I finally listened to it, I was blown away by the singing. It's definitely what comes to mind when I want to show off amazing vocals in metal.

Also classic Angra rules!
Deep Purple still exists?
> Deez Nuts

Holy shit why
I was not expecting Hawkwind
I'm pleasantly surprised. It's not a great lineup, or even a really good one, but I count more than a dozen good bands, and that's an odd occurrence when it comes to these massive festivals.
DTP and Opeth at the same show, wew lads
Solid lineup! I don't care for the bigger bands and there are a lot of good surprises among the smaller ones. 
If you're thinking "hey there actually are a few good bands in here", remember that the 3-days pass is worth **200€**

If you're still not convinced that this fest is shit, they sold all of those three-days passes full price before even announcing a single band

I've been to this fest for many years, and it's really shit now. Very poor organisation (gates open approximately five minute before shows start, resulting in first bands playing in front of five people), astronomical prices (ticket, beer, food, everything), not so great line-ups, and moooost of all, absolutely terrible audience. People disguised as cows or pikachus everywhere, people fucking moshing and crowd-surfing at atmospheric black metal shows, kids and tourists everywhere

yeah don't go there, France has other fests
I wonder how long they argued about which grouping to put Nails in.

Aside from some obvious misses up top this actually seems appealing. I wouldn't travel for it, but if I lived in France I'd definitely go. 
What a clusterfuck, as usual.
Why's the comment section so negative about this lineup? I quite like many bands on here. Even though I don't like Linkin Park anymore, edgy 14 year old me would be angry if I didn't see them. They must be fun live.
Huh, I didn't even know Ugly Kid Joe and Evergrey were still active.
Ugly Kid Joe?
Very jealous in california
This is basically 95% of my concert bucketlist crammed into one festival.
The fact that Perturbator is tucked in there... like, what the flying fuck?? I know Europe tends to be more inclusive when it comes to their festivals, but Perturbator?? They're a futurewave/synthwave project....!! Talk about standing out like a turd in a punchbowl, hahaha
How dare they put Ghoul so small on the bottom. Unacceptable!
Don't understand all the negative commments, slayer, deep purple, steel panther, devin townsend,ooeth, behemoth, nails, exhumed, ghost bath, deafheaven, beyond creation, baroness, primus, EP, electric wizard, BOC, pentagram, chelsea wolfe, red fang, hawkwind, blood ceremony, bongripper, subrosa, and ufammut are all fucking amazing. it's actually good to see a festival like hellfest recognizing some new amazing talent. Yes there are some bad bands on here ie: linkin park but i think the good outweighs the bad
Hellfest.


Linkin Park.
Hmm, so, is Hellfest always this.... eclectic?
A few surprises here and there. I'm really curious about Trust in 2017. I'm pretty sure that it will be really bad, but the first albums are classics (you probably have to be French to think that though) so I'll probably watch their show anyway.
Minus the dude rock it's a solid lineup. Glad to see Helmet still doing shows. 
No Gojira???  As one of few French metal bands I would think they would automatically be in consideration, let alone desire to attend.  
It's better than what download have announced recently
This will be the first Hellfest I won't be attending. Doesn't look like I'm missing out.
Are we just going to ignore ugly kid Joe?

They're still around?

Is anybody else seeing this?
Nostromo is back?!
skepticism!
So hellfest is new wacken now. Wacken used to get sold out before announcing the line up and then line up in some years were good and some years, it was okay. Last year and Last to last year Hellfest line up was stellar, tickets were sold after announcing line up. 
So Arkhon Infaustus are playing after an 8 year hiatus. Line-up is Deviant with a bunch of session members from other French bands (Diapsiquir, Hell Militia). I wonder if that will be any good.
Since I'm a relative newbie listening to metal and know around 10 bands from the lineup, can someone tell me the black/death/melodic death/thrash bands from the lineup that I should be excited about? 

Know about Emperor, Behemoth, Opeth, powerwolf, alcest.
that is a fucking weird mix of bands, holy shit.
I bought tickets and told myself I'd make my decision about whether or not it is worth the trip from Chicago after the lineup was released.  I gagged at first sight of the headliners but there does seem to be a lot worth going for in the remainder of the lineup. Not a slam dunk though, I'm going to need to think about this one for a bit. 
I (mostly) can't stand any band on the first three rows but other than that it's pretty good.
Nails are gonna bring the whole place down.
Syracuse hellfest > this horseshit
I didn't know In Flames had any members outside of Jesper Stromblad.
Peter and Daniel own a brewery together. I'm sure he saw how much happier Daniel was not having to play the drivel they've been releasing. 
I was expecting something different given the post title.
Wow, I just realized they have no original members left. Weird. I wonder if the other guys are gonna start their own group.
Abandon sinking ship!
Jesper confirmed that a Dimension Zero EP is on its way. They never did have a full time bassist on board...
I know this sub is devastated, but you'll all be okay. Give it time. :o)
Wouldn't you?
I was ok with Daniel leaving, but now Peter as well? At least I get to see him play with them one more time tomorrow. 
It's almost impossible to believe the band that made The Jester Race has now morphed into this.
Piggybacking question-

How many people here have ever seen In Flames play anything from The Jester Race?

I recall distinctly getting giddy like a school girl when they played Dead Eternity in like ...'02 when I first say them. 
Sad news indeed, and Am i the the only one who likes their latest album ?
i have tickets to see them in London at the o2 in january with disturbed and avenged sevenfold will they still play ? 
As a very new In Flames fan (only listened to Jester, Whoracle, Colony) are they worth trying to see on this tour? They'll be here in Denver next week, debating going. I've heard they don't play any of the old stuff.
He is such a good bassist as well.
Honestly I thought the recent album was the last in flames album.
They will continue to make terrible music.
He is such a good bassist as well.
:,(
More than anything else those albums made the cut because they're fucking killer, but that aside, if you go in order on those two sections you can get a sense of how things developed in a relatively short amount of time. 

Some of those are the most important bands the genre's ever seen, others made relatively little impact by comparison (i.e. Heavy Load, Riot, Night Sun, Legend, Cloven Hoof).

There wasn't much like that Ungol album when it came out, and wouldn't be for another couple years. You're not necessarily missing anything, it just scratches a different itch than Diamond Head and is a (for lack of a better word) quirkier album. 

Night Sun brings in some prog/weirdness that wasn't there before. 

Listen to what UFO were doing before Phenomenon and then give Phenomenon another shot, that should make it a little clearer what Phenomenon meant. 

Scorpions, "Sails of Charon" and "He's a Woman, She's a Man" in particular are both years ahead of their time. 

Legend is a very niche album (and one that went almost unheard for a while), but again, very ahead of its time. 
I think it is also important to point out that we made that list, maybe almost a year ago and in the matter of a couple of weeks with users and mods and there hasn't been glaring controversy even with the black metal section being the most difficult to craft. I am just saying Metal Evolution, this sub can be contracted out for work and we can bill yall 
> I'm pretty sure I'm missing something; Just can't really figure it out.

If you were to compile a list of the best and most revered classics of heavy metal, nobody is going to like every album on the list. What these lists are for is to give you a broad brush picture of the genre as a whole. Each person is going to have his own journey of discovery and will inevitably have albums he likes more than others.

If you feel like you're missing something, just keep discovering new music and maybe a few years from now, go back and revisit the lists and maybe then you'll have a better appreciation of the albums contained therein.
Taste is subjective. I'm not in love with every album on that list, but I recognize that they are generally some of the most important albums in the development of metal as a genre. There are a lot of folks on here who would completely disagree with you about Cirith Ungol, but that doesn't mean that they're right and you're wrong. Just keep an open mind when you go into each listing. You aren't going to love everything, but you'll only be able to appreciate "the really good stuff" if you listen to the stuff you don't like so much.

Pretty much all of the albums on there have a decent amount of critical acclaim too. Check out each album in [Encyclopaedia Metallum] (http://www.metal-archives.com/) and read the reviews to get an idea for why each one is considered significant.

Yeah adding to all of this, the list you provided is really incomplete and favors the eighties and nineties a in a huge margin over more contemporary releases. Not to knock the list down, but it is definitely outdated and could use some modernity infused into it. 
Seeing them back to back two nights with Sleep in January, super stoked. 
This album is actually my favorite melvins work.

Hex me is awesome, and its a travesty that its only a minute and some change long.
Shining does the same songs in different order since IV. Kinda boring.
I remember hearing this band and Atheist out of the blue in high school. I had never heard jazz fusion in death metal before. They immediately changed how I looked at progressive metal and death metal. And changed how I looked at writing my own music. 

One of the most underrated death metal bands, and their new stuff is still amazing. "'I'm But a Wave to..." is my favorite song off this album, but "Celestial Voyage "was always a close second.
I would murder someone for Focus to get a Dan Swano, Bruce Soord, or Steven Wilson remix and remaster.
These guys were so ahead of their time.. kind of a tragedy that they were so under appreciated when they started out. Too weird for Death metal fans, too harsh for prog/fusion fans. Apparently they were getting booed during their tour with cannibal corpse...

I am extremely happy that I got to see them after they reunited and released traced in air. The lineup with tymon and robin was great and the show kicked major ass. They were playing with dream theater which I thought was a much better fit as well than a traditional death metal band.
Usually death metal that is progressive is called tech death, but this is clearly a fusion between death metal and progressive metal. What a weird song, I better check out the album too.
Growls > shitty vocoder 
Shame they broke up, because I really like Ingrindtation type stuff and the amount out there is incredibly limited. 
this whole album is a monster.
Loved this album. It was radically different from everything ever released. A bit saddened they didn't sustain this line up, but at least I did get to see them when they toured the album a bit.

Very much a fan of Embossed as well. Kind of lost track of them after this one though, didn't find it as appealing anymore.
The drumming on this is too good. 
This album is one of my all-time favorites. Such a unique sound.
Most complete album ever. It has everything a music lover could want.
Man, I haven't listened to Ephel Duath in a couple years now. Such creative music, I used to throw on Painter's Palette and Through My Dog's Eyes on repeat. 
One of the best. 
Love them.
Always room for Fifth Angel forever.
Absolute classic.
>Between you all in Ash Borer and your subsequent projects and labels and guys like Michael, the Skarstad brothers (Yellow Eyes), and their projects and labels in New York, you all have been building something very exciting over the last eight years or so. It seems, from my perspective at least, you all are ushering in a proper wave of USBM—something I've loosely described it as "thinking man's metal" before. Would you say that's accurate?


Fucking stop. Nobody cares what you loosely describe US Black Metal as. And no...it's not thinking man's music. It's simple black metal that sounds good. They aren't trying to solve complex mathematical equations, they're playing music.
Interview also confirms new Vanum EP for early next year
Really digging Rotten Firmament. Reminds me a bit of Pale Chalice.
This might just squeak it's way into my year end list. 
Noooooooo I'm unable to listen to this today! Ahhhgghh!
Shite article aside, psyched to see these guys in January
This article is a perfect example of why I hate Noisey.
>I don't mean that as some sort of elitist statement, more the fact that we're not attempting to reinvent the wheel or reinterpret black metal as something that can exist for more mainstream consumption... We also haven't done anything fucking stupid to cause an uproar amongst nerds on the internet, 

Shots fired!
People interested in modern thrash shouldn't pass up Hypnosia, Sithlord, Power Trip, Pyoveli, Trench Hell, Dekapitator, Antichrist (Swe), Jumalation, Vektor, Hellish Crossfire, Evil Army, Insane (It), Phantom Witch, Lethal (Swe), Merciless Death, Warbeast, Death Mechanism, Deathstorm, Ripper (Ch), Deathhammer, Foreseen (Fin), or Nekromantheon.
As a guy who absolutely loved Time is Up, this album was a let down. Still, great song! 
Their music doesn't always grab me, but I have to concede that they put on quite a live show. I felt like I traveled back in time when I saw them.
Such an incredibly overlooked/underrated band. 
Just got my vinyl copy in the mail today. This album is a thing of beauty.
They're coming to my shithole area of Pennsylvania some time this winter...I can't wait!
I can't believe I live two blocks away from this venue and still managed to miss both nights of this show. 
they'll be in Seattle mid December. I'm super pumped. haven't seen them since Enemy of the Sun
I had to close up both nights of that show. Really wish i could have gone to see that lineup.
Pentagram bitches!!!

Love them, even the two Hasselvander albums that this song comes from.  I even will go so far as to say 'Show em How' is an incredible album.  However, I think I prefer "Review Your Choices" when it comes to the two Hasselvander albums.  Regardless, Pentagram is the shit and I will always upvote it.
Joe Hasselvander really came into his own on Sub-Basement and I think both he and Bobby feel it's one of their absolute best recordings. Can't say I disagree, from the first note of this song to the final chaotic moments of Target, the album crushes you with some of the most demented performances either member has ever put out. It's sick, twisted and manages to stay catchy and groovy all at once. You just can't say no to that.
Good song. Good band.
This song changed my life. 
Love this album.  My personal favorite from it is Saknet.  Such an epic song.
Brain Drill were one of my first introduction to more extreme metal when I was only into intro thrash bands like Megadeth and Slayer.  I remember thinking I can't understand whats going on in the songs but I knew I liked something about it.  Then I actually sat down and listened to the music and just kept going from there.
This band is the butt techdeath of butt techdeath
This is shaping up to be one hell of an album!
Most anticipated album of 2017!
#Secret Satan

Holy shit, 90 of you signed up already. I was expecting....like....5 and we would all get each other our favorite Summoning shirts. The vast majority of these are physical tiers. So I have you all group by region including USA, Canada, UK, Greater Europe, Antartica, Scandinavia, and South East Asia. There is 1 person in the middle of Russia that I am looking for regional matches. 

So you all will get your matches on Friday but I have a few questions and protocol to get through. 

* Over half of you didn't give a name for your address. I understand not wanting to give our your name to weirdos on the internet BUT I am 50% sure your stuff will still be delivered with or without a name to your match AS LONG AS YOU DO NOT CERTIFY IT. Otherwise if you require PM_ME_DILDOS, it will be a hilarious time at the post office looking at IDs but not really because there is a line behind you.

* When do we reveal who we had? Do you all want to do them throughout December in General Discussion Threads or Have two big share threads on the 17th (Best Demo) and the 7th (Top 10)? I have never done secret santa before as I always never responded to those work emails but I am guessing a person posts what they got and then the other person responds (if they want) and say it was them? How do office people do this? 



 
A question on financial support and crowdfunding.

Now I am not going to stand here and say that I pay for every record I obtain. I do use bandcamp quite a bit and try to pick up as much material from there as I can. But I also use Spotify, which is basically not paying individual artists, even if legal, and yes I do pirate for some bands (usually questionable or popular bands)

Lets take a list of every album I've obtained this year. Probably over a hundred. I try to keep returning to them throughout the year to see if I like them, if i dont return to them: deleted.

Therein lies the issue. Do I pay for every album, even if I'll get bored of it after a few listens and delete it? I try to make educated guesses, but say, I bought Messa's Belfry from this year. Highly rated album, i enjoyed it when i first heard it, but now I'm kinda bored of all but one track. I'll probably delete it at the end of the year when I start afresh.

That said, I also illegally obtained Death Fortress this year because I really didn't see the appeal of it when I first heard it, but everyone was raving about it, so I figured I'd try it a few more times. It grew on me and now I love it.

I mean, I buy literally every book I read, and that is a LOT of books, and I pay to see just about every movie I'm interested in in cinemas. Most TV shows I watch are on Netflix, so really it's just music that I let down the artists in some ways.

How many people here really 100% buy every album they may discover in a given year?
Best Metal albums that have a scifi spin to them? I love records like The Key from Nocturnus and the cosmic black metal that Inquisition does but songs that have kind of a scifi feeling to them are not that common.
My mind is still blown after discovering Andy Larocque plays in King Diamond and on Individual Thought Patterns (Death). Are there any other artists who play in bands of very different genres but sound great in both? 

The ones I can think of are:

* John Cobbett - Hammers of Misfortune, Slough Feg (Heavy), Ludicra (Black)

* Gene Hoglan - Death (Death), Dark Angel, Testament (Thrash), Fear Factory (Industrial)

* Dave Lombardo - Slayer (Thrash), Fantomas (Avante Garde)

* Dio - Rainbow (Trad/Proto metal), Black Sabbath (Heavy/Doom), Solo (Heavy)

* Ihsahn - Emperor (Black), Ihsahn (Progressive)

* Mikael Akerfeldt - Opeth (Progressive), Bloodbath (Death), Katatonia (Death/Doom)

* Colin Marston - Krallice (avante/Black), Dysrhythmia (Technical/Instrumental), Gorguts (Technical Death)


Jumping off of a Tool question I asked a couple of weeks ago, what are some of the worst fanbases and why? 
I'm sure a lot of you have experienced some sort of metal-fatigue where you start listening to one of your favorite bands, but it just doesn't do it for you. So you go heavier, into something more extreme, but still nothing, and you go even heavier, into the abyss of the obscure, but nothing can scratch that metal-itch, so you just put on something as far from metal as possible and it's exactly what you've been looking for. 

What songs or artists have saved you from the trench of metal-fatigue and reset you to your normal state? 

For me Hold the Line by Toto will solve any problem, and Regina Spektor, Styx, and Daft Punk will always satisfy me when Death or Exodus can't.
[Last.fm collage for this month.](http://i.imgur.com/La9zzQi.jpg)

Post yours. 
What albums have pleasantly surprised you this year. For me it's got to be ripper's experiment of existence.
So... Doom Metal.  I have a really hard time knowing what to expect from a band just from reading it's Doom.  Is there any list of sub-subgenres?  Something like [this list](http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Bradlez92/the_great_list_of_doom_metal_sub_genres/), but more "official" and less of a joke.
What are some examples of really strange vocals that can be divisive? 

All of the common weird vocals that tend to bother people like King Diamond, Demilich, Inquisition, Manilla Road, early Fates Warning, are all styles I enjoy now.

So I'm wondering what common bands am I forgetting here?

What are some other strange styles that stretch what is considered good or artistic?

What are some examples of just plain bad vocals?
i havent really kept up to date with the release this year. So what are your top 5 at the moment and what albums are coming out for the remainder of the year that i should check out

EDIT: Any genres
Can someone explain to me the existence of alternate versions of the solo on the song Seasons in the Abyss. The YouTube and Spotify versions have different solos, can someone tell me where the two versions come from?
I'm interested in sub geographical regions of metal. 

Yesterday I was looking for more bands had a similar sound to Windir and stumbled upon this article on Toilet Ov Hell [Sognametal](http://www.toiletovhell.com/sognametal-the-legacy-of-windir-part-1/). Basically it's a loosely coined termed referring to bands that rose out of the ashes of Windir in the Sogn og Fjordane region of Norway. I thought it was super interesting to think about a relatively small region producing a very specific style of music.

I was wondering what were some other examples of this? I know more popular examples would include the Gothenburg style of Melodic Death Metal and maybe Cascadian Black Metal. 
Christmas shopping for my girlfriend and family has left me a bit disadvantaged, money-wise. What are the best free albums you know of? Any genre will do.

Here's some name-your-price [Instrumental Black Metal](https://thedevouringvoid.bandcamp.com/album/the-devouring-void) to get things started.
How many times do you listen to a new album in a row? For example, if you enjoy a new album, will you immediately listen to it again, or sit on it for a few days first?
A'ight, who all am I gonna see at the Helstar/Flotsam and Jetsam show in Atlanta tomorrow? (As long as nothing catastrophic happens. Still trying to keep that possibility in mind 'cause this hasn't been my year, having had several things end up getting fucked either the day of or night before. Trying not to be too excited just in case, y'know.)

Also for any locals, are there any cool record stores I should check out?
How many albums are in contention for your top 10 of the year list? I've got a solid 7 that are on the list without a doubt *(Vektor, Moonsorrow, Sunnata, Oranssi Pazuzu, Cobalt, Mare Cognitum, Zhrine)* but those remaining 3 slots are being fought for by a dozen or more other albums.

Also, as an aside, are we including Wardruna on our top 10 lists? I hesitate to call it metal, but at the same time it's on metal archives and is very much metal in spirit.
Thoughts on the Phobocosm/Zhrine/Ulcerate show Saturday.

Probably the smallest show I've ever been to and first truly underground.

Venue was cool. Show took place in the attic of a tavern. The stage was hardly a stage.

I think the frontman of Phobocosm fell asleep on the bench, next to me after Zhrine's set. 

Didn't expect Zhrine to have an electric upright and for him and the frontman to be bowing there instruments. That was the highlight of the night and I love how they did all sorts of sound effects. 

The guitarist of Ulcerate has a really long neck. 

I got to talk to both frontmen of Zhrine and Ulcerate after the show and tell them I loved their new records. Too bad I was too tired to have a real conversation. Þorbjörn looked really spaced out too though. Probably high. Paul was nice. 
Why isn't Nu-Metal considered Metal?
So, Hellfest said they'd announce their line-up mid November, and still no line-up. It's a long shot, but does anyone have any information on when it could be out? Or what the hold up is?
[Hellfest](https://www.facebook.com/hellfest/photos/a.420959652535.197370.26149322535/10153973968452536/?type=3&theater) just released their lineup. I am coming this year from America! I am pumped but was hoping for more black/viking metal. Yet there's enough prog and doom/stoner metal to keep me happy. Plus fucking Emperor! (Wtf is with Aerosmith though? Jesus)
Name your fav subgenre and the most unexpected country you've heard a good album from that subgenre out of. Mine's trad and I found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EplPnAcrhYs) from Turkey. 
Got tickets to Max & Iggor Cavalera 'Return to Roots' tomorrow. Friend of mine saw the show in Munich yesterday and said it was rubbish - anyone else here seen them?

Not the biggest fan of Roots but I was still looking forward to it, now my buddy killed my buzz...
This week in Boston is pretty great for concerts. Tomorrow night is Animals as Leaders, Windhand Friday, and Red Fang Sunday.

Anyone going to any of these?
Anyone know of good metal bands with women as lead vocalists? I've only ever seen two: Butcher Babies and Sorceress. Butcher Babies were okay but nothing special. Sorceress was awful.
Anyone know of any bands that mix black and doom metal? My preference is usually the more atmospheric stuff, but it doesn't have to be. 
I really enjoy Pelican's first EP before they got too post-rocky. The song The Woods is my favorite. Any recommendations for other albums like this? Besides Isis, Russian Circles of course
If you were going to buy one extreme metal album on vinyl what would it be? Something that's solid all the way through but sounds badass played on a record. 
Would you consider yourself a fan of bands? Not just someone who likes an album but is a fan of the band and follow them past their prime?

It's not an objective or rational thing, but I do feel a sort of attachment to my favorite bands (judas priest,  Iron maiden, blind guardian, etc). I get it when people say not to put people on a pedastle, but like I said it's not a rational thing, it's involuntary. I look up to them, want them to succeed and will cut them some slack if they release a dud album. I have respect for these people who have profoundly affected my life.
Anyone know when Helloween is gonna announce the rest of their tour dates for the reunion tour with Kai and Kiske? 
Just saying, I liked Sunnata before it was cool. 


^Accepting ^medals ^please
Anyone else listen to NWOTHM/Modern Trad on Spotify? I'm making a giant playlist of it and I'm wondering what bands I am missing.

https://open.spotify.com/user/1267201609/playlist/1a6nI8XvPsS9gkEzuK95Sw 
[This post got down voted, for god knows what, But I don't care, Keith Merrow and Wes Hauch making music, is a damn good thing for metal fans.](https://youtu.be/_KsvHIMTQ58)

Ambient kvlt and early 90's death metal shouldn't be the only things allowed on the sub. 


Edit, I guess general discussion means general assimilation and conformity thread. 🤔
I like both albums a lot, but I adore this one. 
So yeah, this is really weird, even for people who've heard their previous work. I have no idea how to place it since it's really dark heavy metal but there's also some psych, prog, and even post-rock moments on this record. This song in particular has a really Doors-y section so I felt compelled to include them in the FFO, if only for the double take potential. Every song feels a little unique.  
I fucking love this band... saw them at Live Evil. So good!
Vinyl: http://store.fallenempirerecords.com/product/aureole-aurora-borealis-lp

What a fucking year for trad. This sounds promising.
/u/deathofthesun, /u/protochaud, any fans of Acerus, The Chasm, or Stone Magnum, take note. This drops in two weeks. 
Fuck I want to listen to the whole thing NOW after those tracks, fuck. 
This was a pretty cool album. An interesting mix of genres/influences. To me it sounded like power metal, some Symphony X (so I get the prog) power ballad stuff, of course with some growls (so I see the Melo death).
Just listened to this album the other day, and recommended it to a Co worker. It's not a half bad album
Thanks for the recommendation, /u/dzorrilla, this is bomb.
had no idea this band was still active. 

I used to love the shit out of these guys. Not as much anymore, but I still give 'em the occasional listen. Their final two(three?) albums are pretty woeful.
killer

for the record, the band is from finland. 

Fucking love this band.
Wow "black metal" now ain't that something :) 
What a hidden unknown gem.
I'm really starting to get into early extreme metal, like this and the Celtic Frost song I posted yesterday.  Can you guys recommend more bands like this?
I used to hang around at Jon Z's record shop in NJ back when "Black Metal" came out. It was actually a booth in a flea market containing lots of other booths selling all sorts of crap. He had a TV set up in there with the Venom "from the very depths of hell" video (Witching Hour & Bloodlust) running on a continuous loop. It was hilarious seeing squares walk by looking away in disgust and terror. Venom did some in-stores there too and they were pretty cool guys. 
Still remember hearing this for the first time on some compilation CD like a decade ago and it completely fucking blowing my mind. 
My band covers this song. Tribute to the masters.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nFDFUlKbRs
Purchased this album, Cause of Death, and Human one weekend back in 1991. Changed my life. 
LIFE ENDS

FEELING DEATH


Still the best sepultura album in my eyes.
My second favorite Sepultura album. Nothing beats Schizophrenia for me though. Wish Beneath the Remains had a bit more of a rawer production to it.
Igor was such a beast. So underrated as a drummer. 
Man I really need to listen to these guys more. I've hit *Arise* a few times and that's it.
So many great breaks on this album. 2:40 is just phenomenal.
masterpiece (final song of) 
My favorite sepultura album
Interesting choice to actually add "FFO" to a Sepultura post... I should listen to this album again. I haven't even heard Schizophrenia in awhile. Meanwhile I've listened to Morbid Visions shitloads of times.
The way this band jumps their tempo changes never fails to excite. See, esp, [22s](https://youtu.be/N7Z6H6B6vno?t=22s
) in and [just after the first chorus](https://youtu.be/N7Z6H6B6vno?t=1m42s), not to mention the transition into the [mid-tempo bridge](https://youtu.be/N7Z6H6B6vno?t=2m38s)
Interesting choice to see Exhorder in your FFO.
Just before the Cavalaras became wimps.
One of my favorites by one of my favorite USPM bands.
Strong stuff. How was their 2015 release ?
Good stuff! This place introduced me to this band and I am grateful.
Some early Chastain is always good.
So glad I saw them live. Was just thinking that they'd never reform the day they did, and spend a good while thinking I'd never catch the reformation.

 Fuck they're good live. 
got this album on in the car atm, it's absolutely killer!
One of my favorite Darkthrone songs...but there's no way I will upvote this low-effort post.
Can't beat those vocals
Love this album.
This album and Absolution are both badass records. 
At first I missed some of the sludge from Absolution, but Hunted quickly won me over. Such a well crafted, melodic, epic album.
I've been playing this song over and over today. Awesome choice!
I still haven't connected with this one the way I did with Absolution. 
I like this album, lots of melody. Yes. Good album.
Great album.
I actually just discovered these guys earlier today because they were #1 on Decibel's year end list and I already fucking love them. Any recommendations on similar bands?
Holy balls, this band sounds awesome.
See them live if you have the opportunity. Guys know how to put on a show.
Got this album on CD for my birthday, this is my favourite track

I've basically been listening to nothing but this album for the past 24 hours. Not normally into doom metal but Hunted is fucking fantastic. It's not boring or dull, the songs don't just play one very slow chord for 10 minutes and call it 'heavy', etc. The vocals are amazing, the songs are so well written and just flow so naturally from one section to the next. And the artwork is *amazing*.
if this album isn't top 10 on shreddit's aoty list then something if very wrong 
>trad doom


This remains one of my favorite albums of 2016; no question that it's going to be in my top 5. Killer performance, too. I'd love to catch this live. Thanks for posting.
I have missed having Julie Christmas around so much. Check out both Battle of Mice and Made Out of Babies if you haven't heard them yet.
Angst levels reaching Korn levels. I like it though.
Rad
Brings me back to high school. always liked this song, but felt the growls were unfitting
Been nerding out on this band for years and though they've shown steady improvement from release to release, this is their best record by a mile in my opinion. 
Sigh, that stray E.
Tupperware drums :/
FFO: bad death metal
Opening scene set the stage nicely. Wow!!!!  
The live version of this is even better.
Champion. Eternal Champion.
Why does everyone write Summerlands?
Man, this is one of my favorite albums of all time. It's just amazing. The whole atmosphere is perfect, the vocals are shredded, and the duality between the riffs and clean passages are second-to-none; absolutely masterful. What I'd give for another Katatonia record like this...or even just an album blatantly ripping this off. 
this sorta sounds like the unforgiven a bit 
I've liked every album Horrendous has released so far. This one specifically is much faster than the ones that followed and I really love coming back to it for a spin once in awhile.
There are many great things about Horrendous, but the best may be how quickly they make new music. Can't wait for their next release (should be soon). I don't know how it's always so well written and so well produced in such little time.
I really love Horrendous. Got the chance to see them and hang out with them after their last show in Minneapolis. They are some of the nicest guys out there and they damn sure know how to make some great/unique death metal. Can't wait for their next album (which I've heard 'rumors' that it will be very soon). Standout production and song writing.
This album (and especially this song) is fantastic. Shoots farther up my top 10 of 2016 list every time I throw it on. At this point I think only Vektor and Eternal Champion could challenge it.

Also it's awesome to hear Diamond Head make such awesome music with Tatler being the only remaining original member.
Anyone seen 'em live with this singer? They're playing near me this Saturday and I'm still debating whether to go.
Already taken down.
/u/HighwayCorsair One of the few I managed to find anything of, online.
Obligatory RIP.

Definitely still bummed about their demise, but glad I was able to see them live a few times.

Static Tensions remains my high water mark for them, but I enjoyed each of their releases. 

Hope Laura and Phillip continue making music somehow. 
Just saw these guys live with Iron Reagan and Skeletonwitch a few weeks back. Definitely the odd one out of the night, but it was a good change of pace from the thrashers.
Saw them last night, they are so good live. DO NOT SLEEP ON THIS TOUR. They are playing tiny venues and I'm gonna guess they'll blow up soon
*Love* that band!  The speed and thrashiness are great but the lyrics and the vocals just click every box on my list.
Finally! I saw them perform this stuff live 3 years ago but haven't heard anything since. I was beginning to think it was being shelved...
>downvoting Dead Congregation 
I was listening to this the other day. Loved it, I'll probably order the physical copy sometime soon.
This one just got here a half hour ago with their later 7" rehearsal EP, already gave it its first "real" listen through with the lyrics out. Gonna wait til tomorrow to give the other EP a spin. Still waiting on Purifying Consecrated Ground
Love this band so much!
This band also only ever did two songs. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lzwh5Zrdco) is the other.
[screw the nazi mods](https://twitter.com/KidRock/status/719983895043829760?lang=en)
I'm really tempted, I just don't know if I can make it all 4 days.
My only criticism towards this is parts of the production. The bass drum sounds stupid, guitars are quiet, can't hear the bass and the vocals are a bit too loud. I kind of like how the vocals kind of clip at the high parts, which most would consider a sin.

Anyways, other than that, this is an easy to understand, very well crafted piece of black metal. The vocalist is, in my opinion, the best vocalist I have seen live, and he is very good on the recording too. 

The slowing of the tempo in the middle of the song really helps dial in the brutality. The high pitched vocals are one of the most beautiful thing I have ever heard, and the instrumentation seems authentic, and very skilled. The end of the song feels fairly chaotic, and the only criticism of the songmaking is that the song feels like it ends too soon.
FWIW only like fifteen people were there when /u/deathofthesun and I saw them last month. Great show. 
Blazing riffs on this album
Saw them with Omen, both were great. Rivera looked like a caped Latino Dio.
One of my favourite albums of all time.
Props to a fellow Atlanta Metalhead!
Fucking hit that show. They played a tragically short set when I saw them, but they were *on* the entire time.
I like this more than anything on Accuser.
The song title makes them seem so much more self aware than they really are. 
Really wanted to make it out to their upcoming east coast tour just for Amiensus, but sadly that won't be happening. Never really listened to AW, I've heard mixed reviews but this sounds pretty good.
Is it just me, or do the kick drums drown out a lot of the sound in the first half of this track?

That said, I'm glad AW is coming into their own. Most of their albums are pretty solid but lacking in personality, probably in an attempt to distance themselves from the fact that they put out a deathcore EP once. I talked to Ken Sorceron online in 2009 and mentioned that the *Agharta* EP would alienate a lot of the fans who got into them via *Legend*; he told me that it was the whole intention behind its release, so I wouldn't be surprised.
This demo wasn't online anywhere except in full so I uploaded it with the permission of the band. 
Check out the full EP on [their bandcamp](https://speedwhore.bandcamp.com/). Very solid stuff!
Definitely a bit of RAC influence.
/u/ProtoChaud /u/HighwayCorsair

Just  discovered this band I guess they have been around for awhile. Anyone heard of them.
Rare trad from the middle east. [This](https://soundcloud.com/earsplit-bandcloud/dungeons-n-dragons) and [This](https://soundcloud.com/user-35716976/hammer-down-demo) are the only others I've found.
Thank you /u/ProtoChaud for turning me on to this. This might be better than Demon Bitch. 
CIRCLE OF THE TY-OUGH!
OOOGH
I like the Obituary cover.  It was what led me to seek out Celtic way back in the day. 
holy fuck these guys are good.
I'm not a huge fan of Opeth covers, but do like their version of the song: https://youtu.be/iCSFrP8P6QE
Tom G Warrior yelled at me in an interview once. It was pretty rad.
[Other song from this killer French single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFptY8k8QQ4). 
Please tell me you have some sort of physical version of this
Wasn't a fan the first few times but now I love it.
Riffs are alright but those vocals are horrendous. Sounds like someone that can't sing trying to do falsetto in the shower
Fucking awful band, both live and on record. 
Seems very 3 Inches of Blood-y
AXXION ROOLZ
I want their new album to be out NOW.
just saw them in dallas. amazing. 
So much better than Sweven.
>Metalcore

That's a bold move, Cotton
Excellent! Will keep an eye on this one.
TURN IT UP 
Really glad to have finally seen Razor this year at CDF. Crazy show. 
Great sounding song, I just wish they put more variety into their riffs. Using 2 riffs total in the first half of the song was what really killed it for me. 

Great lyrics and style though, I should really check them out. 
Seeing these guys on thursday with Epica, Arkona, and The Agonist! Never seen any of them before. 
Quite an underrated gem you got here
Who knew a harpsichord could be so metal.
I love this album. It's easily one of my favorite of the year 

The Fool and the song [Mitra](https://youtu.be/Io9oGQEDX_4) are definitely my two favorite off the album 
Cold as perfection is... well, perfection. 
I heard this track a couple weeks ago and immediately wanted to hear more. Listened to the album. I didn't end up liking the rest of their material all that much, but this track is definitely one of my favorite singles for 2016.
I actually just reviewed this album for my website's launch. Loved every minute of it. [Here's the link](https://virtuosity.me/2016/11/27/notable-albums-of-2016-fleshgod-apocalypse-king/), I'd love it if you guys checked it out!
Not seen these guys myself but a mate of mine was fucked at Download fest in his tent and got up once he heard these guys playing from fucking quite a distance away like.

Pretty good apparently, even from about a mile or so away. 

Solid fucking track
Fleshgod Apocalypse is a bit of a strange band to me. Sometimes i am just bored by them but sometimes their music just really gets me and in those moments, there are few things more intense than the combination of tech-death and an orchestra.
My only symphonic contender for top10 this year. Have to listen through the album a few more times, though.
I also saw them on tour with Arkona and The Agonist. Epica skipped my city sadly, they'd be the band I'd like most. Is say Arkona was my favorite of the 3. I was kind of disappointed in Fleshgod. I listened to the album a few times in advance to prepare, and a couple songs were fun,  but overall I thought they were kind of mediocre. The just felt boring to me, didn't seem very technical. And the singer started saying some adolescent Gothic rambling about death being so true blah blah blah. The crowd was super into it though, had some fun in the mosh pit.
Aaan Fleshgod Apocalypse will and must be blacklisted.
reading these comments, I was like why is Arkona touring with these bands...

then I realized you didn't mean the real Arkona. 

Love ENT, but this might get more traction on /r/crustpunk, or even just /r/punk.
So I love Secret Chiefs 3 and love their ability to make surf ridden apocalyptic songs like [Barakiel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZa6JtcCYY0) and [Exodus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIayiuIhkLI) but I think their metal is weak on its own and is only seen as amazing because they flip to such extreme styles. 
Love these guys. 
Really enjoyed this new album. Almost top 10 worthy but my list is too stuffed as it is
These guys are like the AC/DC of atmoblack and I mean that in the best way possible. These albums is killer but I just want more. If it had been as long as *The Divination of Antiquity* it would probably be my favorite Winterfylleth record, but it just feels so short. That Ulver cover is killerrrr though. 
Woah I'm blown away. Didn't know they had released this and it is sick. Thanks.
I STAND BY MY STATEMENT
I'll give it a shot.
This doesn't look like it's going to be the next free metal thread, it would need a broader title. But I totally agree we're overdue for a new one.

As for this specific album, I am not a fan of live tracks at all but the first track is pretty good. The vocals are impressive.
Oof. That album art
I'm really enjoying this thanks for posting it.
Sexual metal holocaust will crush poser gay!
I was gonna post this a couple days ago lol 
Black metal!
arghoslent and edge of sanity, there's two bands with a lot in common. 

On the prowl for more early tech/melodic death with clear traditional metal influence. Anyone have anything for me? 
You posted these guys before right? I recalled really liking them but not being able to find anywhere to download the album
Decided to revisit this on your recommendation, /u/dzorrilla, and I'm glad I am. Fucking killer. 
They are working on their third album. And I am definitly not a patient guy.

Great stuff. Reminds me of very old, epic ManOwaR songs, but with a very dense atmosphere. Love it.
Definitely one of my favorite albums from the last 6 years.
First time hearing this since getting into heavy/power stuff. Great vocals and epic atmosphere. 
One of the best epic metal albums of recent times, released by the most pretentious band of recent times.

Every gig is an 'annihilation' with a 25 page manifesto about how epic it will be. Then they turn up in their jeans & t-shirts, stand entirely still and play for less than an hour with the singer hitting maybe 3/4 of the right notes.

Not to mention they spent 3 years writing this record when 90% of it is recycled and rearranged Manowar/Solstice/While Heaven Wept riffs.
Wow, what a great song.  Can anyone recommend more bands like this (besides Manowar, who I'm familiar with and who Atlantean Kodex seems to take a strong influence from)?
I adore this band. 
I can't NOT upvote Incantation. Such an amazing band. Onward To Golgotha is still my fave, tho. 
**[FAT ASS RIFFS]**
Stoked to see them again in three weeks! Last time McEntee was out, so I'm looking forward to a proper Incantation show this time :)
Maudlin of the Well also the lead singer's previous band

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsuhCkuMQeg

I think this clip puts into video form what it feels like to listen to Xasthur. The music isn't anything special, even in Xasthur's terms, but the video is definitely great. 

So if anyone is finishing up NBBMN, listen to a Xasthur record. It might change the way you listen to black metal.
Masterpiece!!!
Hey guys and girls, it seems like you have a lot to say in reaction to this but I had to clean things up since things got heated and now there is a broken lamp. We are a music related sub but politics do come up from time to time but there are better places to have long form discussions on ideology. 

To some of the newer people in here, we have a General metal discussion thread on Tuesdays and an Off Topic Thread on Thursdays, more political questions and debates can be had. General ettiequte still applies to responses though and inciting violence against any one group despite which side it is coming from is always prohibited. Any questions or concerns can addressed in future threads or even here. 

I originally locked this thread but decided to leave it go since I never have to lock threads. Do not let me down. I believe in you and that this sub is better than others for having measured discussions. 
This whole mess is a giant clusterfuck, and my facebook is lighting up like a christmas tree.
Can I just say that it's weird that there is s large North American black metal festival and this is the first I'm hearing about it?
They are the ones threatening violence...stupidity.
So many comments on this shit not really knowing what the fuck fascism is.

Fascism is a distinct set of political ideologies, not just a generalized term for militant authoritarianism. You can be leftist and authoritarian (Stalinist) or leftist and libertarian (Classical Anarchist) just like you can be far right and authoritarian (Fascism/Nazism) or far right and libertarian (AnCap) or an endless mix of  these in between.
As one guy told me when I was explaining to a passerby what was happening in front of the venue with the police cordoning off the communists and the venue: ''No, that's not what you say it is, it's a neo-nazi festival.'' A neo-nazi festival. Ossuaire, Sangus, Mayhemic Truth, Uada, Forteresse, Aosoth, Graveland, not to mention yesterday's bands: Mgla, Cult of Fire, Morrigan, Blaze of Perdition, Monarque, Moonreich, Cantique Lépreux, Blackscorn.

There was not a nazi banner to be seen, nobody in white hoods, no hitler's salute, just people who want to have fun and listen to their music. People who wrote on a BM lovers FB page beforehand: 'Listen guys, I know there's gonna be some communists shitfuckers but can we stay calm and just go peacefully enjoy BM?''

It's always the same Black Bloc fuckers everywhere in Montreal who wear a scarf to cover their guilty faces, policing everybody's thoughts like the true totalitarians they are and just blocking everything from classes to roads to shows, destroying a university, blockading colleges, etc. They were 20-odd fuckers with nothing to do on a Saturday night, no life purpose other than creating more shit like they've done before, them against 800-something peaceful people who love BM. Apparently they called in a bomb threat, because their 20 sorry asses could not have stopped the show against hundreds of people who waited in line for 2 hours in the cold to make sure they would love the heck out of Graveland and all bands there once the doors would open. They had to lie and make empty threats. After the Bataclan, I'm pretty sure Théâtre Plaza and Sepulchral did not have a choice to cancel.

I, for one, don't want a refund just out of support to the amazing shows Sepulchral puts out month after month here in Montreal and every year for la Messe des Morts. I'm fucking buying all the fricking shirts too.
If lines are to be drawn, it's obvious enough to me which side I would stand on. One has political views I don't agree with. The other shuts down concerts because they don't agree with them. Now who has the better music?
I'm a pretty left wing guy myself, but this really isn't the way to go about doing things. They have every right to put on live shows, fascist or not.
What's fucked up is that I flew out there from Tennessee only for it to get canceled. It was a huge clusterfuck but it had to be put to an end. Had an absolute blast on Friday night at least. Fucking ANTIFA. I was expecting this to happen. Last year or so back in California we had Taake play. Those fools came in and peppersprayed everyone. The reasoning is unknown. Stomp nazis all you want but please have a sliver of respect for others. 

I don't fly home until tomorrow if anyone wants to grab some beers tonight. Made the trip solo. 
1) Who there is an avowed fascist?

2) *If there are fascists,* is censoring them under threat of violence the best approach?
Ah, I hate it when extremists get their way. Damn shame. 
[removed]
Wow. That's fucked up. 
I hope this will only strengthen Graveland's resolve to play more live shows.  



 
Man, reading that Facebook page is pileup of French and English. AntiFa has to know that what they do can be seen a tyrannical and fascist right? Right? I mean, why not just make bands and be the cooler draw rather than shit on someone else's time? 
Can't we just settle this in a wall of death? The festival can go on and we get to clothesline Nazis, preferably to a cover of the theme from Raiders of the Lost Ark.
ANTIFA are cowards.
[removed]
The tolerant left wing anti-fascists at it again...

[removed]
nothing screams "metal" like canceling.

You posers deserve it.

I'm glad I saw them before the new album came out (though not early enough that they weren't playing stuff from it) because I've heard pretty dire things about their performances even of the punk stuff in recent days. 
This is amazing, and catchy as hell. And there's only an EP? You tease...
Cultopaido and R&OMA have to exist forever.
I know most fans are going all 'omg becky, Left Hand Path, and Clandestine', but I really love later era Entombed.  Fucking Morning Star and Inferno are staples to me.
Love the keyboards on this
[Best of the '90s]
Finnish death is best death.
I don't know what it is but I sorta like it.
Good stuff. Right Wing as well?
Love these guys, the voice can get so low.
1. [Cirith Ungol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNiSGKOEcCg)

2. [Mortem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sePaOdj6vuk)/[Varathron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P97GIb1lJNI)

3. [Demolition Hammer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlpyw3H-oek)
What was so bad about 2016?
1) Iron Maiden in March  
2) Ne Obliviscaris in the summer  
3) Black Crown Initiate opening for #2
Gigs that I didn't want to end:

1. Mgla in Oberhausen
1. Sigh in Weinheim
1. Serenity/Delain in Aschaffenburg
1. Serenity/Kamelot in Andernach
1. Unleash The Archers/Sirenia in Weinheim
Razor/Sacrifice/Exciter
Forget the rest honestly since I checked out alot of gigs but that stands out.
1. Mayhem at Nummirock

2. Turmion Kätilöt in Kino, Pori

3. Event Relentless Baarikaappi, Pori

And 2016 definitely didn't suck. What sucks is that I missed a lot of good gigs, but that's what life is.
Absu, Deströyer 666/Ares Kingdom, Jag Panzer/October 31, Blood Incantation/Nucleus, Uncle Acid (1.5 shows twice in the same day), Saint Vitus/The Skull were all highlights.
Cirith Ungol, Slough Feg, Tyrant, Razor, Sabbath, Vastum, Destroyer 666, Mortuary Drape, Satan, Repulsion, Venom Inc, and many more. Still have an upcoming Incantation gig. 
Only concert I went to this year unfortunately, so #1 Sabaton #2 Trivium. Fucking great though.
1. Architects - One of the most energetic show I ever witnessed

2. Placebo - mainstreamy but marvellous. 

3. At The Gates - saw them at Summer Breeze Open Air. Great show, great perfomance


But I have about 5-6 Gigs left this year.. so I see what will come.
1. Amon Amarth, their performance and stage set went above and beyond for this year's tour. 

2. Iron Maiden. Bruce's voice isn't what it used to be but they still give it 100% and they don't have many world tours left in them 

3. If These Trees Could Talk. Flawless performance and sound 
1. Black Sabbath

2. Ihsahn 

3. Triptykon

4. Alcest

5. Zhrine

Middle 3 were also at Wacken. 
I think I only went to 1 concert this year... it was Fleshgod Apocalypse... Pretty mediocre.

I'm so jealous, I'd have loved to see Avantasia. I saw Blind Guardian a few years back and it's one of my favorite shows.
Man, 2016 had some amazing tours. I didn't even get to catch half of them. 

1. Testament/Carcass dual headliner

2. Swallow the Sun

3. Ghost

I'll have to throw some praise out to Sabaton, Soilwork, Kvelertak, Wild Throne, Dark Tranquillity, Enforcer, and Suicidal Tendencies with Dave Lombardo on the kit as well. Catching Ulcerate and Zhrine tonight so this list might have to be updated.
Went to two

Behemoth mgla and secrets of the moon and was awesome!
Also saw wormed and it was almost as good
I just saw Black Sabbath live in August 2016 & that was the most amazing awesome live concert I've seen in years.
My favorites this year were Nile on the Summer Slaughter, Amon Amarth in April, and Sabaton last month. 
seeing one of DILLINGER ESCAPE PLAN's final shows in Berkeley last month was absolutely mind-blowing.  So much energy and love for the fans; it reminded me how beautiful their songs can be
Sob! I only went to one concert this year. Sob! It was the wife's turn to pick so we saw Dixie Chicks.  Sob!  (Actually, I enjoyed the show. They were filming for a dvd and the girls did a great job).
I saw the Melvins this August in a small venue. That was pretty rad.
hands down seeing the misfits in chicago. band sounded tighter than ever and after being a fan since 1992 it was sick to hear the pre-'82 stuff played on time for the first time
I really liked this album. Was my first time giving these guys a chance and holly shit i've been missing out. About to get the rest of their discography. 
There really isn't enough mesoamerican metal which kind of surprises me. Considering the mythology of the Aztecs and the Incas is much more steeped in death and blood sacrifice than northern European mythology. 
The atmosphere is so thick in this song, the melody in the first minute or so is so sinister and beautiful at the same time. Awesome album.
One of the more insane live bands I've seen. Would love a new album from them. 
Saw them last summer (unfortunately sans bass player cuz U.S. and stuff.) and i gotta say, Brittney's singing is even more killer live. This whole band totally rips. 
My band and I did the back up crowd chants for this tune.

Gotta be honest, I can't get into these guys. I've played a show with them and they put on a great performance, but I'm like the only one of my group of metalhead friends that doesn't like these guys. The song does nothing for me, and sadly I have yet to hear a song by this band that grabs me at all. I also can't stand the growling, but I find it's tricky to integrate growling into power metal in a way that isn't ridiculous. 

I'm also glad I saw someone else mention the production. I can't shake the feeling that it sounds like a well-done demo. 
Drums sound like an electric kit being played and sound from samples. Guitars sound boring and sterile.

The song structure is a mess, nothing really develops and the transitions are chaotic. It's simple music that is hard to follow.

The rasp vocal in the end is pretty cheezy, but for me, it's the only good thing about this song.


These guys rule so hard! 
Tonight they do indeed ride tonight! I'm looking forward to seeing them for the first time this evening...
One of the few power metal bands that I do like. 
Brittney has the best cleans in metal today. 
Alright guys and girls...let us not do anything hasty. Put those pins back in the grenades 
This song is kind of a piece of shit
Gives me a chthe'ilist feel, sounds pretty awesome to be honest. I will check out a bit more of their stuff and if they improvise in their music instead of sticking to the norm I'll check them out. 

Sorry about the mental breakdown a couple of days ago, I was that close to going batshit insane again. 

- Reader of words. 

Ninja edits: spelling 
I'm gonna start listening to these guys just to spite Antifa
Yesterday I missed a plane, and I suddenly have the whole of today to burn. I'm stuck in a surfer town full of beach bums and backpackers. And all I really wanna do is listen to Blasphemy. 
I don't really follow the band but I know enough about them to know about their shtick. But I gotta ask. Whats with the sunglasses? 
Is that the Heavy Weapons Guy from Team Fortress 2?
I really don't like grindcore, but I really like this album. 
this really is a cool drum track tho
Trojan Whore is my favorite track on this album. 
Dem arpeggios 
TroyQuan sent me here
Had the opportunity to catch these guys at a little Unitarian church a year or two ago and didn't take it. I'm still kicking myself over that one, Scott Hull is a beast.

WTF: Sleep, Pig Destroyer, Withered, Khemmis, Falls Of Rauros, Cemetery Piss in 2017, what a lineup.
I had the drum intro to Junkyard God as my wakeup alarm for a while to get me pumped up for the day.
I smoked salvia listening to this song one time. It was crazy.
Hey hey hey, don't forget the remastered reissue of this beauty!

[youtube for the win!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcLwQ0uXYUA#)
Nice, I enjoyed that Ancient Spirit tape so will be sure to listen. 
Looking forward to their split with Stolzblut.  Not many bands play this style here in the Midwest
I really wish I had known about these guys when I was getting into black metal.
Isn't there a tag for atmospheric black? 

Not that it matters for casual browsing, but it helps those who filter by genre :)
Awesome song, reminds me of Wintersun first, then slowly fades to something like Edge of Sanity, then later goes full on grind core death metal. So awesome wish I knew about these guys a couple months ago like u/dudelishismusic
Continuing with my winter theme.
Lmao, "winter" 
Real shame that
Øystein Brun continues with this fucking awful band when he was so great in Molested. Then again, nobody in Molested went on to make any good music afterwards, as far as I know. 
I feel like I'm the only one that loves the intros to the songs on this album
Fantastic album. Just ordered a white vinyl copy from hells headbangers as a Christmas gift for my dad! 
I saw them live two times a week apart and I could swear they didn't change their clothes. Not even the band shirts they were wearing.
Holy fuck this rules.
Heri has such a great voice.
Man, this is definitely in my top 5 of the year. I'm not sure it lived up to Storm, but regardless of that it's a great release. Feels like it's taking forever for the LP to show up in the mail...
That new SCORCHED album is fucking fantastic. It's like Vastum with shorter songs, and horror/splatter themes throughout. Artwork's turning everyone off, but with music that strong I don't think it should matter. 
This post was incredible. I thank you for reloading my Spotify with great albums!
My pick of the week would be the new Martyrdöd album. Yes, it's a crust album, but those guitar lines are straight out of the NWOBHM playbook. Awesome record.
holy shit the riff on the bolzer's entranced by the wolfshook is mindblowing. i can't believe i havent heard of them before
What do people think of the new Bölzer album? My thoughts are in my review, [here](http://metalvoid.com/2016/11/25/review-bolzer-hero/).
Thanks for doing this, OP.
I'd make love to your post just for mentioning Root. Root is love. Root is life. Big Boss is... boss.   
Seriously if you have any passing interest in epic black / heavy metal that's been around forever give them a try. The first album is in the same line as stuff like Master's Hammer but it goes completely differently after that. My fav is The Book but Kargeras and especially The Temple In The Underworld are very close favourites.
new Root? Oh my...
I checkout your spotify playlist each Saturday for the new additions. Really nice work! 

Correct me if I'm wrong, but did I see your name in an interview with Max Cavalera in a Dutch newspaper? 
thank you for doing this!
I'm pretty sure I say this every week but I'm just gonna keep saying it: these write ups are amazing and are absolutely essential for me every week now. Bolzer and Hour of Penance have me at full mast right now.
Really enjoying this music. Up till a few days ago my music searching was limited mainly to the similar bands section on metalpedia, so now that I'm browsing the reddit I'm finding lots of cool bands that I haven't seen before. 

Most are from the early 90s, and because I was very young at the time they never crossed my radar.

Anyway great band, great song, worth the listen entirely. 
These guys have two songs coming out in early January, that's pretty exciting 
Fuck yeah! One of the very few slam bands I enjoy
kind of in the same vein I guess, did you listen to the new Martyrdod? I just saw it come up on /r/crustpunk and now i have another bands discography to work my way through
This album is excellent.
Awesome ! My only issue is with the drums, they could be a little more audible IMO. You fins this just surfing through YouTube or some other way. 
Dammit, these guys are good.  Gonna have to go get some of this shit.
Can we not do this, for once

I think you may need to work on that genre.
As much as i love inquisition, i feel like they are getting posted too much recently. This is the third time this week alone.
I never really got into Inquisition but I love this album so much.
MAKE WAY
I like CDs, they're still relevant to me and a lot of the scene. 
Just throw everyone a curve and release it exclusively on Laserdisc
If I were you I'd release it on whatever format you normally buy as a fan of whatever genre it is your band is. The most relevant format kinda varies by subgenre.
Personally I buy all the albums I love on CD. Some of us still have cars where that's the only listening option, and having it on CD means I  can add it to my digital collection before it takes its place in my massive CD binder. I buy vinyl too when I can find it for cheap because it's fun to collect but if I had to choose a prefered format it would definitely be CD
This depends on where you go and how much you are putting in. Discmakers usually has a minimum order of 1000 which is a shit ton of CDs. That is a lot of CDs left over but you need some for merch and promotion. From what I have seen, vinyl is more of a money sink than CDs since the cost per unit ratio is so much higher. If you can find a place that doesn't do a large run like 1000 vinyls, it would probably be worth it. 

Stock your album like you would shirts. You wouldn't order 1000 shirts right unless you were certain you could sell all of them. Have your album for purchase on Bandcamp first and have CDs, Cassettes, and maybe a limited run of vinyl for your shows. People do not buy CDs like they used to but they still do. 
CDs are absolutely still relevant and will bring in a lot of revenue. Your band mate is projecting his personal beliefs to that of society. Ever see a band with a flash drive album or a download card album? That's what's kinda laughed at these days. Take it from me, one album release we had download cards due to time constraints, it was not good.

Vinyl is really great to have, but super expensive to get done. It's easy to get into the $15+/unit cost so keep that in mind. If you don't think your fans will pay $25-30 for a vinyl don't waste your money.   
I notice that cassettes are somehow not in contention at all. 
Cd's are still relevant, but you need good artwork to draw attention. Start with cd's, see how fast they sell, then go from there.
I still buy CDs whenever I can and it's probably my preferred way of buying music. I also buy digital because it's pretty damn convenient, but there's nothing like holding a brand new CD in your hands, looking at the artwork, flipping through the booklet, etc.
You could always do a press of 200 CD's & 200 Vinyl records to see how it sells, if it sells fairly quickly & there's demand for more copies, then print more.

That's just my opinion though.
I don't buy Cd's. Haven't for ages, have no plans to start. I'm all about vinyl, a sucker for it. Addicted. Cassettes are  cool, I've seen more and more often lately which you guys should consider imho. 

Include a download code with the vinyl for extra points. 
Just my 2 cents, but I haven't bought a cd in like 7 years. I'm a digital release fan. 
I think CD's are ok, but for me personally I prefer to get a Vinyl or Cassette.  If I am in need of something on CD (for my car or anything) I can take any of the aforementioned formats, rip it to my computer and burn a CD.  I can't rip a CD to a vinyl.  

Just to clarify, I'm not advocating illegal sharing, I only rip a CD for myself and my own personal use after I've already purchased an album from a band.   

Digital is always a good choice, because it's cheap and portable.  I'm not too knowledgeable on the logistics but I feel like you can always release digital along with anything else.
I think one factor to consider is local fanbase, and just how big you are in general. I think most people wouldn't buy a CD (or a vinyl for that matter) if they didn't recognize the name of the band. 

Since it's your third album, though, I would imagine you probably don't have to worry about fanbase. I'd say go for a small amount of CD's and see how it goes. If the preorder CD's don't do well, you can then sell the CD's as merch at shows without much fail. 
Digital release is probably your most important one. Make sure you have some physical products, if you do gigs. 

And CDs are definitely relevant. Just do some promo and try to get a friendly distributor.
This would really depend on your scene. Some places CDs will sell fine others they won't at all. 

Some places still have huge tape markets. It all varies on region 
I haven't bought a cd in literally forever. I'm considering buying a vinyl copy of Coma ecliptic so I can have it and eventually enjoy the purity on a record player, but most bands are releasing on Spotify right now, and it works great! 
CDs are my default purchase choice. If it's only available on vinyl or I really like it, then I'll go for vinyl. I'll buy cassettes if it's only available on cassette.
I only buy physical media on vinyl, but I'm a really minor edge case. I just don't really dig CDs - doesn't feel the same to me. Big deal for me with wax, though, is I need some way to get it digitally as well. So either a Bandcamp DL included or some other method.
I think it depends on the scale. It shouldnt be too expensive to press a small number to sell at release shows, some to sell online and some to send out to press. If you need larger numbers Id say it automatically becomes relevant. 


Do you release through a label? They must have sales numbers. Let capitalism decide.  


Oh and for me personally: I grew up buying cd's, and I've got rooms full of 'em, but I never ever buy them again. I do buy vinyl, but only if I really like it (still too much). The rest of my music money goes to Spotify and Bandcamp. 
CDs are all I listen to, though I do still collect select LPs.  I couldn't care less about digital; if I need an mp3 of something I just make it.
My preferred format is CDs.  However, the only metal shop in my city sells almost exclusively vinyl, so I do stop buy and shell out $50-$80 every couple weeks just to give them some business.  Digital copies are my absolute last resort.

If it were me, I would definitely make sure that you release it digitally.  That way the circulation isn't limited by what you can afford to print up, and it opens you up to an audience larger than what's in your local area (unless you're purposely trying to limit exposure).  Beyond that, I'd probably go with CDs.
I've sold way more CDs than I have digital downloads, people like physical copies. Some people on the internet say they only get digital, and there are some, but I definitely have gotten more money out of CDs than Digital. 

Unless you do a bigger run of vinyl you arent going to make anything on them, which is fine if you are ok with just breaking even, but you really need to get into 500+ before you can make anything above breaking even on em. 
You'll definitely want CDs. You're gonna be waiting a long time on that vinyl.
Wow, holy moly!  

Thanks everyone so much for weighing in here.  I really appreciate it.  Bandcamp has been our home since the start, so there will definitely be digital releases (also spotify, itunes, amazon etc).

This pretty much confirms that my gut feeling was right.  We are super stretched for money, which is why we are having this discussion at all.  We release everything independently, and only really two of the four of us can contribute financially currently.

We're both really big vinyl fans, and as a band kind of feel like this (3rd) release of ours is really where we're starting.  Like this is really a huge step up from what we've done.  So we want to do a release and do it right.

With all of that being said, we originally were planning to have CDs, vinyls, digital releases, as well as shirts etc to go along with the pre-orders.  Do you think having every format ready to rock for the initial pre-order launch is super important?  Do you think we can do a digital and CD pre-order, then a second pre-order for vinyl versions?

Thanks again, you all rule!!!
Make vinyl.  But don't do any stupid colored shit, black usually sounds the best and looks beautiful as it spins. Also, 180 gram is fucking sick. 
I agree with the comments here, CDs certainly do sell. Especially at live events, I always have a hard time to decide what to buy. Since I am on tight budgets too.  
I am swimming in shirts already, so I am buying albums more often. 

[I recently bought a vinyl of my favourite album](https://puu.sh/sxd2Y/0716ebd1a3.jpg), because I already have both of their albums on CD, two hoodies and.. 3 shirts lol. Yes, I know, I really love these guys.. Next gig I'll get their other vinyl.. xD
This is however my first vinyl of a band. But I saw a good amount selling that evening in Dublin! I stayed at the merch desk till I was the last guy there.. Ne Obliviscaris always comes to the merchandise stand after the show which I absolutely love. 

*I can't even play this.. Yet*, since the only vinyl player in my family is at my brother. I don't even have speakers either, soo... Will be a costly investment. I am an audio lover, so I want to buy solid speakers.. I have a €500+ setup for my headphones. Which is silly, but shows that people buy stuff that they like.  

So if your music is worth the money for people, they'll buy it I am certain about this. Of course, you should probably try to ask other bands for advice instead of us "fans". They have a much better look at merchandise sales. You can find a rough idea of what to expect based on simple numbers. Of course, the more bands you  can talk to, the better. Try to find bands that are in the roughly same or slightly higher "popularity" bracket to get the best estimate. 


 
By far their best album. It was pretty disappointing seeing them last year because they'd just had someone (can't remember who) rejoin the band from the earliest years, which translated to just about no Mondo Medicale. 
I haven't listened to Impaled for years! I forgot how great they are! 
Goddamn those are some brutal chicks. 
Gargoyle's one of my favourite thrash metal bands, insanely fun. Also one of the few thrash metal bands that emerged in the 80s that didn't dip in quality as the decades went on, their new album is one of their best.
Probably my favourite TRoB song. That riff 1 minute in must be the highlight of all the stuff he's written, which is no mean feat.
One of those bands I'll just "Play All" when I have a lot of work to do and need to get into a groove.
this is my fav TRoB song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YShbDj_CCA0
What a magnificent title.
There's something about this project I just can't get into...

Absolute beast of an album.
Easily one of the best bands on UAR!
I love how much of an asshole Jeff is and how it comes out in Birth AD hahaha.

How is it? Worth international shipping?

New song, and pre-order and art are up! 
Really great stuff. Singer sounds so much like Geoff Tate. I'm strongly considering hitting Up The Hammers fest in Greece next year, in part for these guys. Would be super great to see a lineup of classic metal in one of the countries that appreciates it the most.
Great track, great album. 
Great stuff man, been looking for something with a theme like this.
Woah. Didn't expect to see this posted here. I'm friends with the drummer and got into a debate with someone on his other band's facebook over the merits of freewill. Cool to see it gain some traction here.
Sounds great!
Anti-European black metal.... I guess if Horde existed, so must this.
I run an organization called [Kaala](https://www.kaala.jp), a community support system for peripheral creative communities (so extreme metal and related circles). We (my team of 6 and I) are currently focused on strengthening Japan's extreme underground, and do so with event and band management services, design/promotion, PR, big data, etc, and do so in multiple geographies including Japan and the US. 

Just covered the 3rd annual [Grind Fest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc7lK-6ydNQ&t=1s). Good times.

 New project, much better than anything I've released previously. The album came out yesterday.

**Forlet Sires** [Winterthur / Switzerland]

Hey there! We're a (somekind of black) metal band from Switzerland. Our debut album was released in October this year - you can give it a listen on YouTube or Bandcamp (it's free to download resp. name your price too). The first three songs are more on the heavy side, while the second half of the record is a tad more experimental.

Not so much a band as it is a record label. Dirty Needle Records, based out of Minnesota. We specialize in tapes.

**Earthen Ritual** [West Yorkshire / UK] - Doom/Stoner

Looking for some advice. Basically the songs we have got most positive feedback on are [our faster, more simple, catchier ones.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sPCcrRA7h0)

Thing is the main songwriting contingent would rather do an album of [10 minute plus songs, with acoustic sections and odd structures](https://earthenritual.bandcamp.com/track/nemophilist).

Going in to record a full length album in the new year with enough songs for 3 albums and we're struggling to decide on which style we're better at, if any.
Mercury Fountain [Pennsylvania / USA]
https://mercuryfountain.bandcamp.com/album/1
Tech death/black metal/instrumental 
Hi. This is an album I wrote and recorded by myself. My main influences are Deathspell Onega, Ulcerate, and Spawn of Possession. I've had nonexistent exposure and would appreciate a few people listening.
**Ars Arcanum Productions** (Canada/Norway)

I run a production and composition company. I've done FOH for several bands with the biggest gig being at Brutal Assault in the Czech Republic with the Norwegian band Manes a few years ago. I've also mixed a few albums and am always looking for more. 

As a day job I work mostly with acoustic music as I have a master's degree in production for acoustic music as well as contemporary composition. I've had pieces played in several countries and am currently working on getting into a Ph.D program in my field. 

A website is coming soon with a bunch of different stuff. But basically hit me up if you need production, anything related to classical music or music programming for special set-ups. 
**Auxilia** [Charlotte NC]

**Joe Kowalski & The Sex Detectives** [Tübingen/Germany] - Stoner/Sludge/Psychedelic

We are a small band from Germany. Basically we are on the lookout for concerts in and around Germany at the moment. It would be nice to connect to other bands and exchange gigs. We don't want to be famous, we don't expect much money, we just want to go around and play some music for folks who'll appreciate it. Our first album "Tripping on Ego" was released this year in May.

**TAPES**

**[Panzer Squad - Coming To Your Town (2016, Germany, Thrash)](http://i.imgur.com/1KAg34s.jpg?1)**

This is lo fi bratty thrash - imagine a hybrid between Kreator and Sodom with the lyrical sensibilities (ZOMBIES) of modern day bands like Municipal Waste. The band do a good job of meshing the styles together, so though it’s nothing new it sure is fun to listen to. I should also mention the great bass playing here. If you’re a fan of the bass sound on 90’s tech death albums like Cynic’s Focus or Athiest’s Unquestionable Presence you’ll love this. I also love the garish fuchsia tape because black is boring and fuchsia metal is the future. 

**[Violent Scum - Festering In Endless Decay (2016, Chile, OSDMl)](http://i.imgur.com/Mt7D5Jf.jpg?1) **

More Southern American nastiness from Peru (EDIT: I mean Chile, duh). Sort of like Poisonous, Violent Scum play swampy death metal but lean more on the fretboard theatrics and thrashiness of Morbid Angel. There’s also a lot of Mortem’s sound here if that helps. Whatever, just listen to it yourself and figure it out. 


**[LVCIFYRE - SVN EATER (2014, UK, Black/Death Metal)](http://i.imgur.com/8Y9Ma3R.jpg)**

This album is the definition of a slow grower. When I first heard the album two years ago I liked it but found the relentless and exhausting nature difficult to stomach in one go. After two years to digest the thing… Well, it is still a seriously oppressive listen; the drums are unrelenting and the riffs are just… Evil. I still don’t know if I can get through the whole album without zoning out to spare my mind. Regardless, the album makes more sense to me now and has become a favourite in it’s particular genre. 

Fuck me...

[Cara Neir - Plague Ridden Old World Shirt](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/0006417052_10.jpg)

---
Got 40% off on those two CDs from Relapse. Plus I got half off AND free shipping on that Cara Neir shirt. So overall, a good haul. 
CD:

Leviathan - Scar Sighted (Discogs)
Happy Days - Happiness Stops Here and Beach House - Thank Your Lucky Stars.

One was excellent, I want my money back for the other. I'll let you decide which.
I bought the A389 35 records and goodies for $100 thing. I mean... How could I not? That's insane. 

From Relapse I bought:  
Neurosis - Through Silver In Blood  
Death - Scream Bloody Gore  
Pig Destroyer - Phantom Limb

Also picked up Electric Wizard - Come My Fanatics from a local record store. And they gave me a button and a sticker. 

So I got 40 records for $175. That's nuts.  
Grabbed some vinyl from the Nuclear Blast black friday sale. There wasn't too much I needed, but the deals were too good not to get at least a few things.

* Slayer - Hell Awaits
* Slayer - Show No Mercy
* Exodus - Tempo of the Damned
* Dimmu Borgir - Death Cult Armageddon
* Twilight Force - Heroes of Mighty Magic

Edit: Made some last minute Attacker purchases.

* Giants of Canaan LP
* Sins of the World CD/T-Shirt Bundle
Black Friday Edition just means I forgot to put it up before I went to the gym. 
Doing alright?
Their whole alien shtick is pretty interesting. Definitely not something I've seen before. Still can't decide if I like this album. 
It's also Dave Mustaine, who's about as reliable as a chocolate fireman, so I'm not holding my breath.
Guys...I think that if you put a real life firefighter in the middle of a fire they wouldn't fare very well either.  It would probably make a nice Cannibal Corpse album cover though.
USPM from Australia, as it were. Fun fact: some of the lineup from this EP briefly played in Hobbs' Angel of Death. 
Second preview track from the upcoming 'Aurora Borealis' album, set to be released on digital and vinyl on November 28th.
Drum spieln wir auch so schnelllllll 

Wir wolln noch ins bordellllllll.

Sehr geil   
I've been listening to this band since high school. More people need to know about them!!
One of the best albums ever that nobody talks about 
Fantastic album. Gonna actually add it to my queue for tonight now- seeing your post reminded me of how great it is, so thanks for that. 
/u/ProtoChaud /u/HighwayCorsair Might like this. 
Still eagerly awaiting that new Attacker record, speaking of.  
Drinking with the bassist, and he played this song. Think it sounded pretty cool.
I have to say, I thought I would get bored of Judas Priest worship after a while but I just keep loving every new band I hear.
I really don't understand the downvotes must have some trolls or elitists here. Great band I need to buy their albums. Thanks for the post I had forgotten about them.
It's my greatest regret I missed their last show (an all ages one nonetheless) due to a blizzard when I was 16.
Seemingly they play well and Svart has done a great job on the remaster. Source: Finnish music forums and reviews.
Whatever it's a sick album 
/r/heavyvinyl might have an answer for you.
The guitarist's other band Hrom is pretty great too.
Yet another article that I can't finish. Why do you and others share this kind of thing? It doesn't need attention.
>Like any other music writer with too much time on his hands, I spend too much of my time staring into the dark abyss that is the Internet Music Community, a place where trolls run free in pixel meadows and elitists parade around with their big, digital dicks swinging with wild abandon. A place that people like you call home. A place that you find solace with likeminded individuals who find nothing more hysterical than calling every band under the age of 40 'fags'.

First paragraph.....wish me luck I am going in....


**EDIT:** Alright, I am back...guys this is directed RIGHT AT US... you know us who do not go to any local shows and do not want to try anything new aside from listening to Reign in Blood over and over again and call people emo faggots. How did they find us? Who leaked emails? 

>Have a quick search around some of the biggest websites – Buzzfeed, Tumblr, Reddit – and you'll see countless posts about how mindbogglingly fantastic the 1990s were: 'You know you were born in 1990 if you remember literally anything', or .gifs of Johnny Bravo, or 10,000 word dissertations on the beauty of the Sega Mega Drive. 

I feel this rant was written to a very specific instance but then the rest of the article just unfolds into nonsense trying to write like Lester Bangs / Hunter S Thompson having a stroke. 

>That's what you'd say, because you, like the vast majority of the internet are afraid to take risks and yet complain that metal is dead. 

But but but no one said it was...who said it was. I know...these articles about metal being dead and metal not being dead are just yelling at each other and here we are stuck in the middle like a broken household. 
Even with almost eleven full months of competition, that's a strong candidate for the most clueless article posted here all year long. 
I do appreciate when I know I can skip an article based on its title alone. The "metal isn't actually dead" rhetoric is the deadest horse around. 
Was this written in 2007 and put on hold until today?

He just released an album and has already put out two EPs?

Edit: I'm not complaining though.
My AOTY from last year, and my favorite track on the album =)
excellent. 

Really hoping it's good. I'll spin it today and find out.
Oh sweet, didn't realize this is out. Their debut is fucking killer but I'm not as big of a fan of Grand Gesture- here's to hoping this EP is a step up again. 

edit: not bad, but not on par with the debut

Yes dark moor!
Algorithms keep recommending this band to me. They seem right up my alley, looking forward to checking out their discography some day.
Motivator don't do it for me like Another Night did.
Definitely not. It's a good album, but it's not even close to top ten. 
Man I have such a huuuge boner listening to this right now. This sounds like a album right out of the 80s and I am loving each moment of it. How are they live though ?
You ever get to see these guys live?
This year has had some absolutely amazing trad releases, including this one.
I made it to my friend's house for thanksgiving dinner, which his family was kind enough to invite me to. Heard the word "nigger" being said right as I walked in the house. 

[This](http://i.imgur.com/2GNCdQx.mp4) has been me for the past twenty minutes, except replace Aaron Paul with an uncomfortable looking brown man. Please god someone help. This family doesn't even drink so I can't drown my distaste. 

SPICY EDIT #1: "Your parents should have named you something American!" - the uncle that is totally not racist but gets all his news from Breitbart. It's gonna be a long afternoon.

EDIT #3: Great grandpa was a klan member, but the pecan pie is fucking LIT
Energy drinks and dumpster pizza.
stvffing and pvmpkin pie - pennsylvanian hunger
Just had a huge carne asada burrito for breakfast and now I don't know how I'm gonna eat dinner now.


But as for drinking, I bought a Belching Beaver Peanut Butter Milk Stout since I haven't had one in awhile. After that, a mix of wine my brother bought and Mickey's. 
About to bust open a bottle of mead that I started in May. Pretty stoked, gonna sit out on my snowy porch with a chalice of that and an Arkhtinn cassette while the pumpkin cheesecake is baking.  Coming up later is the turkey and green bean casserole and stuffing. Already did a workout with Carpathian Forest to prepare for gluttonous intake.
WELCOME TO /u/padsboltssaints15's WYBEAD POST, SPECIAL *Holy crap please not this guy today* EDITION. BROUGHT TO YOU BY...

Jk no way am I doing that today, I'm just eating normal Turkey day shit fam
Eating the flesh of the False and tears of VVimps

(Nah, I just got McDonald's today, and I didn't even get fries with my meal. I'm pissed)
[Lunch with leftover Ham & Black Bean Soup with Homemade Cornbread + Mario RPG](http://i.imgur.com/J2aebcP.jpg)
I had mince meat pies, sausages, paprika spiced wedges, lettuce, carrot, grapes, spring onions and cucumber. It was a good tea. Had a nice brew too. 
I'm eating the souls of the fvlse and drinking the blood of the unholy goat. Pvser...
Being the self respecting swede that i am i have basically only been drinking [julmust](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ueGd6Q1PZgs/TszYZGUB0wI/AAAAAAAAAMo/1z1fiInKJ84/s1600/apotekarnes.jpg) since they started selling it
Eating the soil from this grave, drinking the poetry of the etc.
 I just had fish fingers and chips with garlic mayonnaise and bread. 

I can heartily recommend a fishfinger, chip and garlic mayo buttie. Marvellous. 
Today I had scrambled eggs, then pizza and a glass of Jack/Iced Tea. 

I live in Canada, our thanksgiving was a month ago 
I couldn't get Friday off so not doing thanksgiving with family. My brother/roommate is going up to the parent's for a couple days since he got friday off and will bring me leftovers! I have a family size Stouffers vegetable lasagna in the oven to feed me today/tomorrow. It's very good if you add a little red pepper and garlic to it. (I love meat, but  find most frozen food to actually be rather good with the exception of some of the meat...) I always cook these things an hour longer than it calls for, let it get a little crispy/brown on top.

So it's that and some Laphroaig or Aberlour scotch later, depending if I'm feeling peaty or rounded =D
Had a glass of local IPA from a growler and got more buzzed than I wanted to.

Then [this](https://imgur.com/2VcIS07).

I ate lots of cranberries a promised in the off topic thread. 

Now I'm enjoying the post meal dump.
Made steak and mac and cheese sitting at home with my friend playing Battlefield 1. Home is too far away to be with family for a 4 day weekend. Started with drinking Miller Lite now I've moved on to rum and coke. Not a bad day.
I made chana massala (chickpea curry) with saag aloo. It's super quick to make and very easy for leftovers. Scrumptious. 


I've been drinking cheap beer and blasting death metal since I woke up a couple hours ago. I'll be eating turkey, ham, and other thanksgiving staples in a couple hours when I meet up with my family for the afternoon feast. 
Eating magret de canard (the best thing we French people ever invented) with grilled potatoes tonight :D
Lots and lots of alcohol in my free time. The university exams are approaching and I'm not really in a good mood because of the stress.
Biscuits 
I'm Canadian, so I just had pizza for lunch and there's pulled chicken in the slow cooker.
I had some turkey, mashed potatoes with some bomb ass turkey gravey, green bean casserole, and wild rice. My godfather gave me a 16oz. Budweiser and I've had like 3 glasses of riesling and a glass of moscato
Turkey sandwiches and soup. We can't afford an actual bird.
Energy drinks and hot pockets. Going shopping. Yea. THOSE sales. Boyfriend has worked his butt off and wants a new tv and Xbox but has to work. So my ass is doing the "good girlfriend" thing and standing in line with the other crazy ladies with my headphones on and Inquisition drowning out their whines. Will be devouring Reddit stories of terrible holiday situations during my long wait.
Ate a lot of mashed potatoe and had a pint of Guinness. Truly an Irish-American Thanksgiving.
Well, my family decided to have Thanksgiving dinner late this year (read: normal dinnertime for us, so like 9) instead of the typical 3-4pm "dinner" with a run for seconds at around 9, so all I've eaten is roast beef sandwich.

The gluttonous feast to start in about an hour, however, consists of turkey, mashed potatoes, gallons (not literally) of gravy,various casseroles, and roughly all the other things you'd expect from a southern family today.
Working at an airport with about a dozen Puerto Rican moms who cooked for the entire staff, and holy shit it was amazing. I have no idea what it was, but it had pork in it and it made me question Thanksgiving forever.
I'm having an existential crisis and was up most of the night fretting about my future. I'm about to turn 34, am really coming into my own as a guitarist and am suddenly aware that the years where accomplishing anything as a heavy metal musician might be possible, are almost used up.

I'm torn between two bands in a situation that I can't help but relate to being married to a guy who you are slowly realising is emotionally abusive while also having an affair with an ex who you unintentionally lost contact with and who seems to be everything you want/need/deserve.

So I feel like shit, it isn't a holiday in Australia and I'm at work trying not to fall asleep, I decided I'd 'treat' myself to maccas and having just finished it, I feel guilty about the garbage I just shoved into my face and a tad nauseous to boot.

I'm looking forward to beer later. Venting actually helped a little, time for a cigarette, may as well go for gold on ingesting poison!

Happy turkey day, USA!

edit: I just realised this has little to do with this post. This shit is fucking me up :-/

BLT
As a non-American I did not have the pleasure of eating myself half to death, so today was just a normal meal.  

I had pasta with parmesan cheese, bits of bacon and a raw egg yolk mixed in, paired with a salad of letuce, tomato, advocado, cucumber and onion.
Well I'm doin the ol' keto thing where I eat under 20 carbs a day and eat a lot of fat. My dinner was lots of turkey, ham, mashed cauliflower, green beans... some sweet vinegar cucumbers. Had a bunch of bacon for lunch. Skipped breakfast because I had ALOT of coffee that tends to fill me up. I put butter, coconut oil, and heavy cream in my coffee.

looking forward to the no bake, no crust pumpkin pie cheesecake I put in a blender that took me like 5 minutes to make. Just gotta wait for it to solidify in the fridge. Fuck crust. I never liked pie crust anyway.

One day I ruined cauliflower pizza crust I made by using foil instead of parchment paper so it all stuck to the foil...so I begrudgingly threw it in a pot and to my surprise it tasted like stuffing. ...I should have made that today.
Just another day around these parts. Had palm hearts for lunch, yogurt and cookies in a couple hours. Iced green tea all the time. 
[IASTADAMACASH]!
I'll be eating Thanksgiving dinner in another hour. We're having turkey ( I love dark meat), stuffing, grilled baked potatoes, and red cabbage. I'll be drinking apple cider. Also pumpkin pie for dessert.
HAM
The flesh of the mindless wretches of society   
Edit + blood
I'm up here in Canadaland, you guys are like a month late with all this thanksgiving crap. I'm eating leftover butter chicken with "You're my Boy, Blue" blueberry ale from Howe Sound Brewing. 
Beer and tacos for my family this fine thanksgiving. 
I went to McDonalds before work

That was fun
Hit the gym this morning and then headed to my parents. Whiskey at 9 AM and rambling hoping I didn't say anything too stupid before the turkey.
Pizza, Pizza and more pizza, with a side of microwave popcorn and apple juice 5 litres.
Just been sitting here listening to metal and drinking irish vodka mixed with sprite/mtn dew while eating tv dinners.
Hot n Spicy Chicken Wings and Cherryade
Just got done eating pie (pecan and apple). Now I'm gonna have a nap, so i can be  awake for liquor and strippers later (as is tradition) 
Lots of craft beer. I don't dig the traditional Thanksgiving meal but the family tradition of everyone bring 3 craft beers is very lovely.
I had the most traditional possible Midwest Thanksgiving out in Chicago. Turkey, green bean casserole, yams topped with marshmallow, you get it. 
I've had a few Gumball Heads and just had a sick-ass manhattan. I will be having another. 
Thank Christ that my in-laws are chill and there's no talk of politics. 
had a sausage and egg bagel for lunch, snacked on brie and crackers, in the middle of reverse searing the steaks we're gonna have for dinner
Had the the traditional Thanksgiving dinner. Dragged my poor mother into the mess that is my in-laws. Drank good beer, regret nothing. Oh, listened to Dio. 
Toast Hawaii for lunch and sour tripe for dinner.
Butterscotch schnapps but that's because I'm broke at the moment and a $5 bottle of liqueur is what I can afford.
Spent the day at work. Still here actually. Ate a pretty good dinner with my residents and went right back to hating my coworkers.
A bunch of greens, mashed taters, fruit and prime rib for Thanksgiving. Also had a Deschutes Hop Trip alongside it- great beer, really fresh and unique flavor. Probably going to have a Jubelale later tonight.
So much turkey. The stuffing has bacon and sausage in it. There was nothing, not even being mostly full after the first plate, that could prevent me from eating a second plate.
Woke up at noon, so McDonalds for lunch. Then a day with my dog an fallout:new Vegas, followed by beers at TRVE Brewing (heavy metal brewing company in Denver. Go if you have the chance). Then a turkey & dressing dinner for one at Denny's. Pretty decent for my first thanksgiving without loved ones. 
Had steak rather than turkey for dinner along with baked potato and Texas toast along with a bottle of top-notch root beer. Today is a good day even though I had to get up at 4:30 AM for my flight.
No thanksgiving in austria, so the usual stuff like pizza and noodles or eating at a food stand because i'm lazy
My dad made fake-Norwegian turkey tacos. He's half Norwegian and half Mexican and all whitewashed, so he made lefse (Norwegian potato flatbread), turkey, homemade gravy rendered from the turkey fat, mashed potatoes, and stuffing, and rolled it all together. He does that every year and it's fucking amazing- by far the best Thanksgiving meal I can imagine, and every time a non-family member tries it they're blown away. My girlfriend and my sister's boyfriend got to experience it for the first time this year and they were huge fans.

For dessert, my grandma made cheesecake (hers is the best I've ever had), butter cake (better than it sounds), chocolate bunt cake, and apple fritter stuff that I didn't eat. Definitely calling the night a success. 
We had Spinach/Ricotta Ravioli in a Heavy Spicy Sauce w/ some breadsticks. Alcohol. And no relatives. Pretty successful overall.
Dang I am late to the party.  Since it is the morning after thanksgiving proper, I am having a reheated roll w/ lots of butter ("toothbutter") and cranberry sauce.  Plus coffee.

Yesterday I made roasted brussels sprouts w/maple syrup and almonds.
Man I wish I lived in Chicago, I would love a $20 ticket. I would post this to /r/music and /r/chicago as well.
This is great! The production gives it a whole new layer of dirt and I love it.
Been stuck in my head all week! Loving this record atm.
Favourite song on this album. The rest isn't my cup of tea style-wise but this is awesome. 
I thought that was FFO: Delaware 
Wooo

Is this a LP or EP upcoming?
Can't listen to it now, but thats a promising FFO. Definitely gonna have to give this a listen when I can

What are your favorite hip-hop/rap albums?

I personally love ATLiens by Outkast, Enter the 36th Chamber by Wu Tang Clan, Section 80 and Good Kid M.A.A.D. City by Kendrick to name a few. 
I'm leaving the country tonight to go to a (optional) school trip to Munich and I'll be back on Sunday evening.

We'll be getting a tour of the BMW factory and Munich Airport, as well as some other things that I can't remember at the moment. It should be fun!

If anyone is interested, I could post some photos of the trip when I get back.
My country(Israel) is basically a blaze right now.

Cheer me up?

Happy thanksgiving
Since I am only doing a small amount of cooking this year, I wanted to post a couple of my favorite thanksgiving recipes.

Rolls: [Richard's pain au lait](http://www.pbs.org/food/recipes/pain-au-lait/).  Like so many other people, I got hooked on *The Great British Baking Show [Bake-Off]*.  These were my first foray into yeasted dough, and they're easy enough for a beginner.  Pearl sugar is totally unnecessary.

Sweet potatoes: [Mark Bittman's Brown Butter + Sage Stir-Fry](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1475-stir-fried-sweet-potatoes-with-brown-butter-and-sage).  If you have a food processor, these are stupidly easy.  If not, they're still easy to make but you'll do a lot of work grating the potatoes.  The flavor on these is huge and your guests will be disproportionally impressed by the unusual presentation.

Mushroom gravy.  For 12 years I was vegetarian, and still mostly avoid meat.  I cobbled together a mushroom gravy recipe from a variety of sources:

> Finely slice 2lbs mushrooms.  A mix is good, especially if you can get fancy kinds like porcini, chanterelle, etc.  But crimini + shiitake are good and widely available.  Saute these in a wide skillet.  (Make sure they have room, and let them really brown for god's sake.)  Use some white wine or vemouth or marsala to deglaze.

> Get a big saucepan, add olive oil + butter, and sweat some garlic and onion or shallot.  Add maybe 3 Tbsp flour to make a roux and cook it until light brown.  Add a little wine, then your mushrooms.  Stir to combine, add 3–4 cups broth or stock, and let it simmer for a while.  

> Finishing: you can thicken if you like with cornstarch, potato starch, arrowroot, etc.  Heavy cream is a nice addition.  Of course you'll want salt and pepper.  And I think a secret weapon is sherry vinegar (or balsamic)—add just enough to make the gravy a bit tart.  Serve over everything.
Why did it take me so long to hear about Spirit Adrift!?!?  Shame on you all!  Seriously, just wanted to say check these gents out, they are amazing!  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To59bUpTy0Q)
I may put another thread up later this afternoon as a special holiday treat. I have to go run a 5K now because I was feeling like I enjoyed running at one point when I signed up but now hate myself because I hate running. Its also fucking cold and raining. 
What are some good TV series that came out this year? I'm not terribly impressed by Westworld and I've heard The Crown is pretty good.
I'm going to drown in cranberry sauce. For whatever reason that's what I'm most excited for.

Black mirror made me a little paranoid. 

At lvl 8 in Morrowind I already have full glass and can levitate for 2 min. I now understand why people say it's easy to break the game

Excited to see Ulcerate and Zhrine on Saturday.

Yesterday I missed my hometown's exit by 25 miles bc I was so deeply engaged in the convo I was having with my sister.
I recently started trying to learn playing the guitar. I found the tabs for [Metsatöll - Ema Hääl Kutsub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TncntatX7Y). My fingers hate me, but I can play the first third of the song without looking at the tabs. 

Now I just need to make it sound good :)
I'm thirsty, what should I drink?
#Comic Round Up

[East of West](http://i2.cdnds.net/14/48/comics-east-of-west-interlocking-covers-16.jpg) - Holy fucking shit I am so mad I am just reading this. A great mashup of sci-fi / western / biblical prophecy / alternate history. I read up to issue 20 which takes me to this year but the art and story has been consistent. 

[Southern Bastards](http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/5592b3aa371d22a40e8b507a-799-672/screen%20shot%202015-06-30%20at%2011.19.19%20am.png) -- Pretty decent Southern gothic (?) themes and tropes. The second TPB is waaaay different than the first and I am sort of only on board with the first arc since it ends very neat and unexpectedly. 

[The Wytches](http://danielspencer.ie/portfolio/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/wytches.jpg) -  Scott Snyder modern horror with believable characters and surreal art. This is probably what Sandman looked like when it came out before it looked fucking cheesy. 

[The Wicked + The Divine](http://65.media.tumblr.com/7daf268e74b4dd8306fa2e06c93749a8/tumblr_n63hzaXxTg1tuoa2wo5_1280.jpg) -- Ugh fuck this book. This reminds me of the movie Dogma where the ambition was tripping over the lack of execution. Where East ofWest had a grand theme, this feels so confident with little punch. Pop stars are actually gods blah blah blah. 

[History of the DC Universe](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1279206-george_perez_and_marv_wolfman__the_history_of_the_dc_universe__page__023.jpg) -- I am pretending I am going for my masters in fictional history of superheroes. 

[Dungeons and Dragons (2010)](http://hollywoodmetal.com/2016/11/23/dungeons-dragons-2010/) -- Fuck yeah...who wants to watch an adventure module drawn out? 




Wanted to wish you all a happy thanksgiving ! 
I've been up for 28 hours. Just trying to get through the holiday so I can go to the Red Fang/Torche/WHORES show tomorrow. 

Update: finally got some sleep. 
Driving up to Canada today for Messe des Morts fest to see Graveland. Fucking pumped. They just made a post saying there'll be Antifa protests organised outside the venue after already spamming the venue with threats. This should be interesting. Anyone else in Montreal this weekend?
Anyone else happy that they don't have to wait in jealousy for the new Pokemon games anymore? 
What's the absolute longest I should go before changing guitar strings? I've now been learning for 8 and a half months on the same set of strings. I have a spare set ready to go, but I'm stingy about changing strings before one breaks because I don't want to keep buying backups; at the same time, though, I don't want to be possibly doing harm to either the guitar or myself by leaving strings on too long. As soon as one breaks, I'm planning on changing them all, but if that doesn't happen, should I switch them out sooner?
So who's at work on Thanksgiving? This guy right here. If someone could do me a favor and just kill me that'd be great, thanks. 
Who are your favourite Metal Heroes?



Anyone here watch Lethal Weapon on Fox? I love the movies a lot so the show looks not good. Do you like the show and why? Anyone a fan of the movies and the shows?
I'm alone for the first time on a major holiday and I'm not sure what to do with myself. I plan on watching football later, but that only takes up so much of the day. Anyone got recommendations for shows to watch or videos to look up to pass the time and keep me distracted? 
I went to ICW Fear & Loathing IX on Sunday and it was pretty great. Ricochet [flew into the crowd](https://streamable.com/q19z) about 6 feet from me and Kurt Angle has a hairy back.
Any good memoirs of metal heroes? I've read Iommi's and loved it, so many cool stories. I'm considering Mustaine's. Sure he's a jerk, but might still be interesting.
So about these new metalhead boxes: does anybody think they are worth it to buy?
Any fans of the old Christopher Reeves Superman movies? I rewatched them all on a special edition collection I got a while back and am going through all the special feature now. I've been watching nothing but documentaries about the movies and the old Fleischer cartoons for a week now lol. 
Right on, I was just jamming this album earlier today!
Malcolm Pugh can do no wrong.

This thread
>How are you celebrating ?

I feel unprepared this always sneaks up on me. 
He died 6 years ago on May 16th..so 2,383 days
The sad thing for me is that I got back into metal right after he died. When I was a kid I listened to classic rock and metal (mostly Metallica and other mainstream type stuff), but then I got into classical music in a big way and listened to that almost exclusively for a decade or so from about age 15-25. Then 5-6 years ago I started listening to metal again because I was going to the gym, the classical wasn't cutting it for that purpose, and I was also really stressed by law school which the metal helped relieve. So this time around, in the internet age, and with services like pandora and spotify, I was actually able to explore the wide world of metal. I started with the NWOBHM and american power metal that my pandora station fed me, and it would occasionally throw in a Dio song. So I started seeking out more Dio. I listened to his whole discography. I listened to Dio sabbath and Dio Rainbow, which I loved as much, if not more. Stargazer and A Light in the Black taken together is probably my favorite piece. Something about Dio's vocals and the mystical/fantastical quality (without getting *too* weird) of the songs and lyrics just strikes a chord with me. So I was really, really late to the party, and had the great misfortune of my favorite figure in metal passing away right before I even discovered him. I makes me feel like a poser, unfortunately. I wish I could discover a newer metal act that resonates with me like Dio does, but I have yet to find it. If anyone has any suggestions I'd be happy to take them. Unfortunately most of my favorite stuff is from the 80s, and while Iron Maiden and Judas Priest are still churning stuff out, who knows how much longer they will keep at it. 
I'm off to the witch.

is it really ...6 days since, or 7?

how is this counted most correctly?

I'm going to sing him a song.  I'm a singer.
Well this went from metal af to shitpost in no time
>How are you celebrating ?

I guess today is a good a day as any to start playing the Holy Diver video game starring Dio, Ozzy, and Randy Rhodes, that I've been putting off for years. I've been in the mood to play Castlevania lately so this works out perfectly.   
what?
Well, it look like I'm listening to *Rising*, *Heaven and Hell*, and *Holy Diver* again.  
The devil cried the day Dio died.
My coworker said it's been 6 years, 6 months, and 6 days since Lord Dio rode his ethereal tiger into the mouth of the devil while Rainbow in the Dark is playing.
Man, what a dude he was. OP, good job thinking of him, he was a master. 
I'm glad to help you get one closer to 666 upvotes! 
[Also this post is has 666 points right now!](http://i.imgur.com/bcQtR5p.png)
Anyone hear if there are more plans for some live releases sometime in the future? Such as the Live in Philly '86 that came out a few years ago.
Picked up a Greatest Hits CD from Wal-Mart the other day.  I really miss Dio. What a cool guy he was.
🔥🤘🏼🔥

That's all I have to say about that.

I didn't know why at the time, but I binged some dio songs the other day, singing along :)

"His name is Dio and he dances on the sand"
Ha, i (obviously) didn't even know this, but coincidentially was listening to Black Sabbath's heaven and hell for the first time in a good while. Amazing album, amazing band, amazing vocalist. Rest in Peace Dio.
Same thing I do every year, look back at some of the man's best performances.

[Black Sabbath - live at Castle Donington 1992](https://youtu.be/1WzOBd5c5Yo).

[Heaven and Hell - live at Rockpalast 2009](https://youtu.be/P4gRBaWhosI).

[Dio - live in Amsterdam 1983](https://youtu.be/uTJeSBOb5cQ).

[Rainbow - Live in Hamburg 1976](https://youtu.be/U_yGZRT6SDI).

This is only a small selection of his amazing performances. 
Does it matter? Well it does to me, and I can tell you why.
You tried OP
I still remember being in high school during lunchtime when I got a text from my stepdad that he passed away. What a different time that was for me.
[Very nice] (https://memecrunch.com/meme/89NHP/dio/image.gif?w=400&c=1)
I was fortunate enough to catch both these guys farewell show in 2012 and then the reunion show in 2015 haha. They are fucking great live.
Got the CD for like $2 blind without realizing that the 2015 pressing has a bunch of later songs along with the original 1984 EP. The original EP, which this is from, fucking rules. A lot of the 2010 recordings are fucking awful, though a few are okay. Was a confusing transition until I realized that it was probably compiling more than one release. 
FFO: Of all the killer stuff Shadow Kingdom reissues 
Hell's Headbangers 10 CDs for $20 sale eh? I got this same CD as a blind buy and thought it was pretty damn good. Also picked up Deceased, October 31, High Spirits, and a few others I'm looking forward to. 
What exactly is the definition of "epic" metal. I've heard the term before by a band like Manilla Road, which is pretty tough to define, although I consider them more trad/USPM. 
This is a one-man project by a guy from my city. I thought it was pretty alright so I posted it here to get into more ears and get the guy some support, hopefully.
Okay so I just had to take a detour from my originally planned [NBBMN schedule](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/5aihy0/shreddits_general_metal_discussion/d9got06/) for *Legions of Perkele*. I haven't had this kind of immediate "FUCK YEAH" response to an album since *[Metal Revolution](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/4dl80b/whyblt_what_have_you_been_listening_to/d1s8kzm/)* over half a year ago.

Aggressive, energetic black metal with fucking fat drums-forward production, and then they throw in this kind of '80s glam metal riff... I am *sold*.
Very, very good choice
Plz come back BoK...plz come back

Always loved this cover art.
I was lucky enough to see Ungol at their first show in decades at Frost and Fire II in Ventura this year. They were fantastic. 
My favorite thing in heavy metal is when the musicians reference the fact that they're playing heavy metal.
>  Having been stricken by a sudden wave of cerebral inspiration, the guitar player and vocalist demands to embark upon our conversational foray without further delay.

I'm done with this.
I dig the new album. I know some people are pissed because they aren't as heavy or aggressive anymore but I listen to all sorts of stuff so I don't give a fuck to be honest. 

Only criticism I have is that the clean vocals sound like Troy Sanders trying to sing 80's goth rock, and that's coming from a huge Mastodon fan and someone who likes a bit of 80's goth rock.
Pretentious interviews like this make me hate bands so much. Shut the fuck up. I guess when you drop an album that's fucking garbage you have to compensate how tough you are somehow.
Well, that was pretentious as fuck.

Edit: this bit tho

>I read an intriguing theory in an article that received a bit of traction a while back, produced by a blog that promotes ‘extreme metal and intersectional feminism’. It raises the possibility that Okoi in fact only pretends to be a free-spirited individualist, in order to divert attention from his clandestine fascist leanings. The time has come to confront him.
Out of curiosity, when do they usually announce these? Because I'm hoping to be in France in 2018 and would love to go. 
Kinda annoying these sell out before bands are announced. 
Badass album 
Was just listening to this today. It's not my favorite Razor Album, but this song kicks ass.
Best song on the album
Everything about this album is so damned good. That haunting instrumental opener then straight into Darkday, awwwwwwwwMATE absolutely killer. 
"LIVING WITH THE SPIRITS OF DEATH

LIVING HELL, LIVING DEAD, LIVING DEAD!"

**RIFFS HARD**
I was revisiting this album just yesterday. I honestly like Edge Of Sanity more than the other classic swedeath bands. *The Spectral Sorrows*, *Purgatory Afterglow* and *Crimson* are all fucking great.
Edge of Sanity was an amazing band by all means. Easily one of my favorite Swedish bands. I also think that Swano's solo album, Nightingale as well as his new Witherscape project is amazing. Haven't had the chance to pick up any Pan-Thy-Monium yet though.
I suggest pushing back. It's a whole lot funner than going on the internet and crying about getting shoved afterwards. 
That has been the case at every metal or punk show I have been to. If you don't want people pushing you you'll have to stand at the sides of the stage.
Yes. That's at generally every metal concert. The center is usually where the mosh pit forms and if you're in the front and center, you'll usually have the pit right against your back. Your best bet is to go to the sides or stay in the back. Depending on the size of the venue, you might be fine in in the center at a huge show if you can get right against the barrier, even one person in front of you and you'll have to deal with a lot of moshing. You'll have to deal with it at while you're against the barrier too but it's much less of a problem because it's only coming from your back and you have something to hold on to.
What the others said. Sometimes it's fun to be up front in the madness and close to the band. Other times you just want to enjoy the show without a ton of people touching you.
>You could hear the breaking of her bones    
As the axe went through her neck    
Didn't realise at the time    
That he killed the one that he loved    

Probably my second favorite song on the album, behind (obviously) *Angel Witch*.
this song, the title track, and white witch alone are good enough songs to make this band legendary.
Fuck yeah, Satan's great!
God, I love Satan...
This is wonderful! 
I'm a simple man, I see Satan, I upvote.
My favourite track from the album!
Quite looking forward to seeing them again in January. 
Good tune. A little short, though. 
Sounds more like Black/Death than Cavernous Death. One of those riffs is a straight Black Witchery rip. 
Any suggestions for similar bands to Primordial? Like Celtic themed doom metal?
Man, I love Laster and I've been trying to push them on Shreddit a lot. Happy to see them reappear. Such a unique, irresistible sound.
really underrated band
Omnium gatherum have alright music but their singer can't stop pushing that stupid hand sign they have during shows constantly

-[ ]-
Darn, no UK shows.

I saw Amon Amarth a year or so ago and they toured here a few months back so that's fine. But I hope DT hit the UK at some point.
That sounds amazing.

Fuck Australia, I'll just go see Katatonia in a few days and drown my sorrows away I suppose.
When did Amon Amarth become a bigger band than DT? And big enough that they get DT as support, not even co-headliners.
God Damn, no offense to Grand Magus or Testament but I kinda wished these were the supports for the UK Tour last month :(
Because God forbid I can get DT to come back to Florida...  The time of year where I envy the other side of the pond is fast approaching.
Thanks for the info, just secured tickets.

It's my birthday when they play in cologne, and i live right next to it, no way i can skip that chance! 
And they're playing in my town!  
ALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN! CHOO CHOO!
The fuck. I hope Dark Tranquillity will make an own headliner tour next year. Can't stand Amon Amarth.
Yes, Pratteln! Z-7

Especially stoked for Omnium Gatherum & DT since i've already seen Amon Amarth this summer. 
Can't wait to see them and shoot their gig in 3 weeks. They'll be playing with Behemoth. I also get to do an video interview I hope!
They sound Swedish or German, didn't expect them to be from Georgia. I may disagree with their religious views, but this album is a contender for my top 10 list.
Cool, I'm downloading this.
Wow, this is awesome. Been looking for something like this for awhile.

I liked it. Does someone have a list of more bands like this one?
Heeeeeyyyy all, you did great last week answering all of the questions. One that got in late is a pretty easy one. This [guy/girl](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/5c0jcn/rec_center_shreddits_official_recommendation/da877xw/) is looking for metal covers of non metal songs. Please answer this so I can save the link and add it to a bookmark to give to people when they eventually make a thread for it. 

I guess that it is for you guys. Nothing elese that culd possibly interest you except for maybe a [Japanese psych folk record full of strings.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0vkxRsYX-A) What about a compilation of [Nigerian disco/boogie/funk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qND82X5p3co) that has taken over my life?  What about this [fucking Yugoslavian electro space album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itOz_sp1rA0) from the 80's? You want it all. It makes great dinner music for Thanksgiving. Your family already thinks you are weird. You are always on your phone during dinner and laughing about dog memes. 
Looking for something like Vanishing Point(specifically like King of Empty Promises and Hope Among the Heartless) but where the vocals aren't so subdued.
Oy fellas, I recently stumbled across Green Carnation, and the song/album "Light of day, day of darkness" really touched my soul. Can any of you recommend me an album with simular progressive style throughout the whole album? 
Something heavy and yet melodic/progressive, similar to the later Enslaved albums (Ruun and Vertebrae are my particular favourites) or earlier Opeth. I'm a bit of a noob when it comes to black/death metal so feel free to throw anything my way. 
Hi guys
I'm looking for some great French black metal, more doomy/dsbm is ideal, but also into really melodic stuff

Also looking for something folky, doomy, and melodic.  Like Ghost got Opeth pregnant and Black Sabbath is the god-parent. Edit: not French on this one
Stoner Rock/Metal like Kyuss' "Welcome to the Sky Valley.",even more leaned to Metal. 
[Terror Sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgqz9n_9K4)
Something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GPFduVKuEg) Bolt Thrower song. Death metal with not awful vocals and some groove. Something that gets your head bobbing without realizing it.
I'm looking I guess for metal that incorporates sounds from americana/country/rockabilly/western while still being primarily metal. Some albums that have really been sticking in my ear in this vein are Baroness - Blue Record, Cobalt - Slow Forever, and Kvelertak - Meir. 

Pref. with either sludge or black metal influence as well.
1. Oldschool tech death like Human or The Erosion of Sanity

2. I've never really listened to **MANOWAR** before, what are their best albums and where do I start?
Any worthwhile 2016 black metal releases. Demos, eps, lps, obscure, mainstream, anything goes.
Stuff like Immortal Bird - Empress / Abcess
Hey Shreddit give me some stoner doom metal! [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EisEjpBEotg) was the song that caught my interest for the genre, got any recommendations based off that? Or just any stoner doom that you're in to?
What's some stuff like [this](https://unspeakableaxerecords.bandcamp.com/track/to-the-chamber)? Is it dungeon synth? Is it some other genre? I just don't know. Cool as fuck, though.

/u/kaptain_carbon why don't you love me :(
Looking for stoner instrumentals like

 [Sunflora by Palmanana](https://palmanana.bandcamp.com/track/sunflora) 

and [Moons of Neptune by The Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lz0BGyq8Utw) 

or just melodic instrumentals like 

[Voice of the Soul by Death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3OPOYG6XIQ) 

or [Black Star by Yngwie Malmsteen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blNQZc84Q5c)
Give me some thrash with melodic vocals.  I'm looking for stuff similar to Iced Earth, 80s Metallica and Metallica's newest LP, Flotsam and Jetsam, Watchtower, Heathen, Metal Church, Toxik, Annihilator, and Voivod.  If you want me to go into more detail, I'll be glad to.

**EDIT**: Added Flotsam and Jetsam, Heathen, Metal Church, Toxik, and Annihilator.
Recommend me an album that is like Blood in Our Wells by Drudkh.
Tech death? I've listened to the stuff on the wiki. I really like nile too. I'm not familiar with much, so hit me with anything.
Black metal that sounds like [Marduk's Materialized in Stone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAvKt9OpBoc)
Any more speed/EUPM bands? I know (early) Helloween, (early) Blind Guardian, Scanner, Rage, Running Wild, (early) Grave Digger, Paragon, Primal Fear, Blazon Stone, Breitenhold, Stormwarrior, and Riot (they're USPM but *Thundersteel* is close enough). I'm not looking for EUPM like Gamma Ray, Iron Savior, or Savage Circus. I'm also not looking for USPM like Jag Panzer or Brocas Helm. USPM leaning towards EUPM is fine, but I prefer EUPM. It's a specific request, but hopefully you guys can help. Thanks!
Hey there! I need some recommendations of songs that sound similar to these ones: 

[Testament-Musical Death (A Dirge)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQbudNKR0NE)

[Death-Voice of the Soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3OPOYG6XIQ)

[In Flames-Pallar Anders Visa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wswKhCaD5I)

Somehow I ended up listening to the 3 of them today and decided I needed to make a sort of compilation of these kind of songs. Basically, they are rather slow melodic solos, dark, no lyrics, and the guitar is the main instrument. Any ideas?
Could someone recommend me some doom metal with female vocals? I discovered Messa on the General Metal Discussion thread but I can't find the post anymore and I don't remember other bands that were named. I'm looking for stuff in the vein of Messa, but maybe a little less drone-y, with the Sabbath and Pentagram vibes.
The Thing i'm searching for is a bit hard to explain, but i will try my best.

Basically, i am searching for songs with parts that have a lot of forward momentum, where you feel like you're being pulled through the song.

Some Examples so you hopefully get what i mean:
[Here](https://youtu.be/pWc9KOTkB4A?t=19s), [Here](https://youtu.be/RSvTAJiTUfE?t=50s), [Here](https://youtu.be/Bskeoo_yfuw?t=1m3s) (i have timestamped the moments that i mean)

I know this is kind of vague, so just give me anything that you think would fit. Subgenre doesn't matter, but i feel like it's a lot more common in power metal.
Shit I forgot to post and now I'm late. 

I want more crust like Iskra. The more 2nd wave black influence the better. 

Give me some really aggressive, punchy (i.e. screw your potato cave, give me loud drums and fat guitar chords) black metal in the spirit of *Panzer Division Marduk* and *Pure Holocaust*. As I explore the genre (yay for NBBMN) I'm finding that this is one of the styles I enjoy most.

I'm still working my way through the entry-level bands right now, so the more "classic" the better.
Like Det Som Engang Var?
Hopefully im not too late to the thread, im looking for 2 things:

-Bathory-ish black metal in the style of havuukrunu( man i love these guys)/ vindland

- Good epic/atmo black metal in the style of caladan brood, emyn muil, summoning, etc
Old school black metal, in the vein of [Mütiilation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIy4Ve8YEh8)

Doesn't have to be old, just old school style


I'm looking for some symphonic metal or orchestral metal similar to music found on Metallica's "S&M" album or similar to "Mjolnir Mix" of the Halo theme song (the one with Steve Vai on guitar). I've been listening to some symphonic bands like Nightwish and can't seem to get into them. Can anybody point me in the direction of some good bands like this?

I'm also looking for some atmospheric metal that's great to listen to when writing and/or thinking, bonus points if instrumental or slow paced(think "The Hunter" by Mastadon, "Dopesmoker" by Sleep and "Blood, Milk & Sky" by White Zombie).
I would like some Death Metal bands that sound like Pissgrave. 
[deleted]
Looking for any bands like Havukruunu, with that kind of Finlandic folksy melodic sound blended with pagan fury. Goatmoon, Falkenbach, Heimdalls Wacht are already favourites in my library. 
Death/doom like Autopsy?  I already know of and enjoy Incantation, Asphyx, Filthdigger, Vastum, Obituary, and Sempiternal Deathreign.
I recently heard Scorched's Echoes of Dismemberment and would like some recommendations similar to that album. I've already listened to some of Mortal's Path stuff (thanks /u/kaptain_carbon) and I'm spceifically looking for riffs. 

Also, throw some good Black Metal my way please.
Trad or Black/Speed Albums from the 80s that somehow got buried and never saw the light of day.
I'm looking for some stuff similar to present day Aosoth - bass heavy/thick, mid-tempo black metal with a bit of a groove.  I've browsed last.fm's 'similiar artists' tab, and I personally don't think any of those bands sound like Aosoth, or at least the sound I'm after.
Looking for some nasty metal that has didgeridoo in it. Thanks
I love the sound of the drums on Judas Priest's Painkiller album. I think the way they were recorded and mixed are just perfect. Can you recommend any other albums with that perfect of drum mixing?
[deleted]
something like Sargeist- Let the Devin In

I've been searching for a few things.

1) I've been listening to Elder's amazing release "Lore" pretty non-stop since it came out. But 5 songs just ain't enough. I need more! Is there anything out there that matches the energy and beauty of this album?


2) Angry and Rhythmic. I've been listening to alot of Gojira tracks like "Backbone" and "Vacuity" and old live Sepultura recordings.


3) some black that has a sense of ambience. 

Thank you in advance!
I'm seeing Gorguts, Marduk and Mgla next year, already into Mgla, not sure where to start with the other 2 since their discographies are so big. So yeah how do I get into Marduk (already listened to Heaven Shall Burn a few times and really enjoyed it) and Gorguts?
I'm looking for some Christmas metal. Probably a little early to be asking, but I'm curious how much I can find before Christmas this year. Could be anything from covers of classic songs to just stuff that has themes of it. So far my list is just Theocracy and Sonata Arctica's EPs/singles
hey guys, I'm looking for some more power metal that's similar to Blind Guardians 'imaginations from the other side', I like it because it seems abit heavier than the other power metal i've heard, the vocals especially seem grittier. (trying to get into power metal). 

Also some thrash in vein of Metallica as opposed to slayer, I'v been listening to alot of thrash recently but most of the bands im listening to outside of big 4 (kreator, destruction, death angel) seem to be way heavier, however im curious and want to listen to more that seems to be abit more melodic, if that makes sense. 

Can you rec me some real riffy bm that's not too heavy on the blast beats. Immortal's At The Heart Of Winter and Samael's Ceremony of Opposites are some of my favorites. Really like Inquisition too.
Gimme some progressive melodeath, similar to Omnium Gatherum and In Mourning. Strong preference on deep booming vocals instead of the high raspy ones
Favourite Death Metal demos from this year? Been loving Tomb Mould and want to see what else is out there. I'm not hugely fussed on the style of DM. Like I said, this is more of a cursory round up. 


I'm looking for some Black/Speed in the vein of [Bewitcher](https://bewitcher.bandcamp.com/track/sin-is-in-her-blood-2) and [Midnight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQVnyDAY_wU).

I'd also love some essential bands for French bm. I know Peste Noire and Deathspell Omega, but that's about it.

EDIT: Thanks for all the suggestions, I'll check them out.
1. Black/Thrash that isn't D666, Nocturnal Graves, Aura Noir and Abigail. 

2. Beherit worship like Void Meditation Cult. 
Two things. Quite different.

Best Doom/Sludge from this year. Already heard Lycus, Khemmis, Lion's Daughter, Graves at Sea, and Inter Arma. More evil the better.

Best power metal from this year. Pretty into Twilight Force so obviously it can be cheese ball as hell. More looking for *that* vein of power metal rather than USPM which is more similar to trad IMO. Thanks in advance ghouls and gals.
Been waiting for this. Please recommend me something unbearably heavy that just places a weight on you. Something kinda like suffocation's "effigy of the forgotten" and cannibal corpse's "tomb of the mutilated." I'm open to any genre black, grind, and death. But just want something super heavy to slosh me around.
Something that will quench my thirst for Caladan Brood that isn't Summoning (or any of Jake Rogers's other bands)


Something that will quench my thirst for Atlantean Kodex that isn't Isen Torr or Solstice
Any more like the NOWBHM acts I've listed below?

* Trojan
* Girlschool
* Raven
* Saxon
* Aragorn
* Blind Fury
* Samson
* Tygers of Pan Tang
* Satan
* Demon
* Hell
* Iron Maiden
* Tokyo Blade
* Tank
* Diamond Head
* (Venom and Witchfinder General are good but not what I'm looking for, really)

I mean I probably don't need more bands since I've never dug deep through the discographies of most of these, but I'd love to know more bands from that scene anyway (or that sound like they could be for that matter) because they've made up the vast majority of my listening for the last few weeks.
Your potential AOTY material from the past couple months. Any genre, just fresh and good.
Can I have some really depressive doom stuff like Woods of Ypres?
Give me 2 albums from each of these classic bands I've never really gotten to in depth, and then if there is anything post 2000ish worth checking out.

Bolt Thrower

Obituary

Overkill

Cannibal Corpse

Vader

Neurosis

High on Fire (just give me 2 albums, since they're 'newer')


Two things. I'm looking for more black metal in the vein of The Ruins of Beverest. Especially production wise. Second, more trad like Hammers of Misfortune, riffs with lots of keyboard. 
Submitted this two weeks ago, but I only got a very limited response of what I was looking for. Please don't just link me to wikis. I'm familiar with wikis. 

"Kind of a vague request, so I'll try to be as clear as possible. What are some bands or albums you'd recommend for after your "where to start recommendations"? People always say, "Where do I start with x?", and get "Look at 1, 2, and 3." I'm looking for 4, 5, 6, etc. If possible I'd like black metal recommendations to give me more material for NBBMN, but I'm interested to see people's next steps for bands or genres."
I'm looking for some DM that sounds like Phlegethon (composition wise), but from a country outside of Finland (production/tone wise)

Are there metal bands that have jazz influences kind of like prog rock bands used to have ? 

Also is there more stuff like Tribulation's -The children of the night.

Long black metal tracks, need not be atmospheric strictly but something I can listen to while studying.

Thanks a lot in advance.
Looking for an album with bone-crushing heavy, slow-ish and long songs like in Electric Wizard's Dopethrone, but less Stoner/Doom and more Death Metal. I'm still trying BM and am getting warmer about things like Cobalt's Slow Forever, especially the vocals there. but I'm looking for lower, heavier, lower-pitched vocals ideally.
Long songs are a bonus - ideal for longer runs.
What are your favorite modern doom albums that are borderline radiofriendly or palatable to a classic rock fan?
I'm looking for death metal bands that sound like Dead Congregation. I already know about Incantation, Grave Miasma, Cruciamentum, but I feel like none of them can compare to Dead Congregation in terms of atmosphere or riffing.
Rec me some finndeath along the lines of Convulse, I already know of Demigod, Demilich, Rippikoulu, Adramelech, Purtenance and Funebre.
With the cold weather upon us, I'm in dire need of some quality, fun folk metal, along the lines of Korpiklaani, Eluveitie, and Ensiferum. I currently listen to a lot of those three. Along with Arkona, Turisas, Alestorm, Heidevolk, and Tyr. Any help is appreciated!
I've been listening intently to Dor De Duh (yeah, what a name...) recently. Spotify can't seem to recommend me anything similar. I'm especially fond of the second half of the album.

Basically, atmospheric black metal with a bit more complexity than, say, burzum. Anyone got any similar bands?
Hey guys, can anyone introduce me to the french and the french-canadian metal scene, I came across the term metal noir and it sparked my interest, and I also live in a country bordering France, so why not get acquainted with their scene in case they tour near me. So far I know about Gojira and Alcest, and a few very small bands I stumbled over on bandcamp on my quest for free music, but those are mainly french-canadian.

But there's another thing I want to ask! I noticed NBBMN is all about cold and icy black metal. Can someone give me hot and fiery black metal?

Thanks in advance!
Anyone know of any vocals and atmosphere as good as **[Menhir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tnhE3Ww0bY)** found anywhere else in Metal? Preferably the same style of Folk but doesn't have to be.

EDIT: XIV Dark Centuries is probably the closest I already know.
Is Blackened Stoner a thing?

The closest I can think of is Cobalt's Slow Forever, but even if has more of a sludgy/harsh vibe than what I'm thinking of. The reason I ask is yesterday's general metal thread my response to an ideal 'hybrid project' would be an atmoblack WITTR or some such collaborating with Om or Zaum, etc. Does anything like this exist? There's definitely an inconsistency in aesthetic/tone one being cold and the other very warm, but there's a definite shared trait of hypnotic-ness and droning long songs between atmoblack and stoner.
I'm loving the song Revel in Bones by Rage Nucleaire. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=epjbdyzMG8U

What other bands/songs have those sad but powerful black metal riffs?
Give me all the speed metal you have! Bonus points for Bandcamp vinyl 

Edit: new, old, produced, or raw as fuck, gimme all of it 
Apparently those arpeggios toward the beginning are the hardest thing Petrucci ever played. I've never attempted to learn them, but even he struggles with them live. Anyways, great song, I love the AA suite.
Probably my least favorite track on what might be my favorite DT album. There are a ton of great riffs, and the drumming, per usual, is sublime, but it seems to drag on a little too long for my taste. Also, the lyrics about the AA stuff are quite trite (which, we're talking Mike Portnoy writing lyrics, so it's not shocking). All that being said I still love this song.
Tbh, I never really got the Dream Theatre love. I understand that they pioneered the prog-metal genre, but I never really finished any of their albums. If I were to do so, where do I start?
Oh yeah, this is filthy. 
That Hierophant cover artwork is awesome... Think I have to assume it was done by Paulo Girardi. 
That's a nice list. Especially glad to see Assück up there, as well as my favorite Bolt Thrower record. 
they should have had to change the name when Hat left 

For those of you disappointed by the way the new Bölzer turned out, this album is pretty much a clone of Aura with relatively few outside influences, though those influences do show themselves occasionally. 
THOSE FUCKING DRUMS
Also, if anyone could recommend similar bands, Tha would be great. 
http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=4276&type=card
Beheading Tyrants exceeded all of my expectations. It may well just end up as a late entry in my top ten. 
So this was what Uada was before they decided to rebrand themselves? I guess if you like Cradle of Filth or Hecate Enthroned then this is cool. 
Nice find! I'd rather call it Prog Black
This video is awful but I'm really excited for the new album
that should have said 1999, dammit. 

oops

Nice!
This band needs more appreciation. Trondheim maniacs.
That's a **serious** groove they get into. 
I adore this album. 
Since this is getting a bit of traction, fans should check out other proto-metal artists like Buffalo, Bang, Blues Creation, High Tide, Jerusalem, Budgie, Dust, Stray, Sir Lord Baltimore, Wishbone Ash, and Spooky Tooth. Proto is pretty bomb. 
Love me some Flower Travellin' Band, Satori's the heaviest early metal album.
I saw this band in a little club at SXSW 7 or 8 years ago. I had never heard of them and had no idea what to expect. Was blown away.
Bonus - [Varg himself playing it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyAmTS1Y-50)
I hope Hoest joins Blink on stage to play his mouth-harp.  
DON'T LEAVE ME  ^boing  
ALL ALONE ^boing
> blink are one of the headliners at Tons of Rock Festival, which also includes a good amount of high-quality Norwegian black metal, like the legendary Emperor celebrating the 20th anniversary of Anthems to the Welkin At Dusk, Satyricon and Taake. There’s also doom legends Candlemass, German thrash vets Sodom, Swedish power metallers Sabaton (playing 2012’s Carolus Rex), and more.

This is so great, it reads like the Onion.
Hopefully they just come out and play Dude Ranch in its entirety
SAY IT AIN'T SO. I WILL NOT GO. 

(Actually, I'd totally go, if it wasn't in a different country.) 
r/nottheonion 
Considering their reputation for being a kinda silly band, I wouldn't be surprised if they came out in corpse paint and did some silly kinda black metal jam for a minute or so. 

Not sure what Blink will do though.
Travis Barker [dressing up like this](http://i.imgur.com/7GluS2z.jpg) wasn't so weird after all. 
It's not like it's Blink 182 on a black metal lineup, it's a variety of lots of different styles of heavier guitar music. Really not much strange about it if you ask me. 
I've seen Emperor one time, on a US tour about a decade ago.  They played a small club in Chicago called The Metro.  It houses maybe 1200 people.  They were the headliners, I discovered a new band that night when the rockabilly group Reverend Horton heat opened for them.  

That was one confused crowd when guy carried out a stand up Bass.
What the fuck
Wish this was in Brooklyn
Beer bottles: Apply directly to the forehead.
Sorry, what?
I'll meet you in the middle at the Ghost Bath show
If Tom Delonge was still in Blink 182 I would actually love to see that lineup. 
This year...
What happened?
What a time to be alive!
why the hell is Taake listed second-to-last, legendary band
Wait, is this a different blink, or...
Very interesting lineup, I was really close to buying tickets to this show, but decided to go with Beyond the Gates instead, kind of glad I did. Not that I have an inherent problem with Blink, just not what I'd want to fly to Norway for.  Though I'm sad I won't see emperor unless they come to the US
Was there last year, great festival. Lineup this year is strange. Death metal Legends Sodom are below Satyricon on the flyers which makes absolutely 0 sense, & B182?.. There were some borderline cringe bands last year but now..
I love how this festival has all of my guilty pleasures and non-guilty pleasures together.
Blink 182 / Emperor sounds like such a bizarre combination. 

I know, it's some festival, but man, those two in one sentence...
I thought Emperor called it a day after the 20th anniversary of In the Nightside Eclipse tour? 
I'm really confuse. 
I would love to see blink 182 get interviewed before and after the show
What the fuck?

P.s. Love Brooklyn vegan
Well that's unexpected. Airbourne too, they're a bit out of place next to the others
I would unironically pay money to see this. 
I'm only slightly surprised Blink 182 is above Emperor on the bill. It still hurts though...
A
Dude, wtf?
Grabbed two Hell CDs for $3 each. If you use BLASTOFF10 you get an extra 10% off. Thanks to a couple of dudes in /r/powermetal for the sale announcement and the extra coupon code. 
Why do these things always happen so far from payday
I missed the coupon code but still grabbed Ex Deo, Hammerfall, Kataklysm, and Dimmu Borgir CDs. 4 CDs for $17.50 including shipping. Great sale. 
Got some Nile, Immolation, Enslaved, Hell, Blind Guardian and some other stuff last night. Some great stuff there if you dig through it all. 
Really tempted by that Hell Awaits vinyl for $15
Grabbed five records, thanks for the heads up.
Their self-titled EP is available for free download at [bandcamp.](https://rivothrillsludgefvckingmetal.bandcamp.com/releases)
[Fuuuuuuuuuuuck](http://i.imgur.com/J5Qkv.gif?noredirect)
Damn, thanks for the heads up mate!
Rosenfeld's great, there's rumors of a new album soon.
Hope I show someone a good band to check out. Ive only listened to their first record, let me know if youve got any recommendations.
Enter The Grave is great, but personally I think this is one of its weaker songs. You should definitely check out their other albums. "Five Serpents Teeth" and "Skull" are awesome.
great classic
Yo its gone. Got another link? 
paul gilbert is the best. i enjoy his new rock albums but i kinda wish he'd put on the bright pink epiphone guitar again, tease his hair, and start playing some really 80s ass metal
Pounding down the back roads, higher than a steeple!

One of my favorite albums, all hail Gilbert.
All this love for Paul Gilbert, and none for Juan Aldarete? da fuq yo
Gilby is not just one of the best shredders ever, hes sooooo nice!
paul gilbert is the man
That's awesome!

Green! Greens nice! ;P
Fantastic demo.
This place is literally 45 minutes from my house.  Definitely gonna be looking into this.
Lineup is killer, I'd love to make it out to one of these some day. 
Wretch was 22 on Decibel's top 40 of 2016 list.
Man there are some killer bands playing, I wish I could make it.
I wouldn't mind seeing "The Atomic Bitchwax".
Oh shit cavern is playing hell yea. I'd love to see destroyer of man on this lineup
RemindMe! 2 Months 
$30 dollars for four days of music? For fuck sake. Most we had in Australia was soundwave, and that was over $100 for one fucken day. And that was before it stopped running cos the promoter went fucken bankrupt
Holy fuck Captain Beyond!? I'm nowhere near Maryland but that is beyond awesome. I had no idea they still play. Still any good live?
Too bad it's the same weekend as Rockfest D:
My band opened for Apostle of Solitude some months back. Good dudes, good doom, glad to see these guys are on a good spot!
you clearly are more skilled at posting than I am.  I posted this a few weeks ago and got almost zero responses.  

Last year was tons of fun, this year looks like it should be fun too!  However I don't think the lineup is quite as good as last year.  No Wino and no Victor Griffin and I was really hoping to see Unothodox on the bill again because they were on it last year and cancelled the day before the show and I was really bummed I didn't get to see them
Bands I would say are definitely worthy of checking out from Top to Bottom:

Valkyrie, Beastmaker, Captain Beyond, The Well, Wretch, The Skull, Bang, Wo Fat, Old Blood, and Horehound.
Chaps. It takes a certain kind of guy to hang their ass out on stage. It's whatever, I guess. Fuckin' 80's...
Every week apparently. Whatever, I like WASP.
Attention female metalheads: listening to WASP may result in spontaneous pregnancy. Viewer discretion is advised. 
Always upvote Aspid. Was reading a Russian interview with them from a year or two ago where two of the members claimed that another member had attempted to usurp the entire band by claiming that he came up with the name and attempting to establish his own version of the band where he'd have full control. Seems as if the two bandmembers interviewed were actually quite keen about putting together new material and had been working on some, but this development had derailed the chances of new stuff coming out.

EDIT: Interview is [here](https://vk.com/aspid_thrash?w=wall-816856_1499) for Russian-speakers. It was actually the drummer (who played little role in the writing) who suddenly attempted to take control, and through all the headaches the other members lost interest in continuing the band.
When I post Aspid I got like 2 upvotes.
Fantastic album. Fans should check out early Obliveon, too (demos and From This Day Forward). 
Wow I can't wait to hear metal covers of such Star Wars classics as:  
The Imperial March  
Duel of Fates  
The Cantina Song  
And...uh...That song from Jabba's Palace?  Fuck this project.
These [Insert Pop culture topic] themed bands are always awful. Like that Ned Flanders band was just terrible. And I generally dislike labeling stuff as bad, awful, terrible, etc. 
/r/EmpireDidNothingWrong


Crystal Age and DVC remain the best Star Wars themed metal. 
Fuck yeah! So good...
Incredible band. Hoping to score more of their cd's for Christmas 
> FFO: Blacksmith

Good call, there's probably a ton of people who like them and haven't heard Jag Panzer before.
*GIVE 'M HELL CAUSE YOU'RE HARDER THAN STEEEEEL*

^^Oh, ^^wrong ^^song.
DOTS raises a good point. It's [this Blacksmith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqDN5dQvO9Y) I'm mentioning in the title. 
proof that metal is literally classical

i haven't really listened to much joey tafolla stuff, even though i've checked out most of the shrapnel lineup otherwise. based on his playing here he's still a fair bit behind his 80s contemporaries but i've never listened to his solo stuff
To be quite honest I'm pretty turned off by a lot o USPM, but I do enjoy any Jag Panzer that I've heard. 
Any news on the new album?
Love the band but I've never really been able to get into the singer. Any recs for their best songs in term of vocals? 
I'm just a casual fan, but I always loved Jag Panzer's 2003 re-recording of [Licensed to Kill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgchXul1hLA).  I know the band only did it because of issues with Joey and most people hate the re-recordings on *Decade of the Nail-Spiked Bat*, but i just love the rawness of it.
who thought the hard right pan at the beginning was a good idea
This post finally inspired me to track a physical copy of this album down. Thank you!
Same artist that did this album's cover is doing some demo art for me, pretty stoked. 
Love this song
Sounds a bit like Chrome Division. Just throwin' that out there.
Love this album, probably AOTY for me.
Love this album. You can understand what he is saying and it is so aggressive.
If you're into the bands, you'll have fun. Accommodation is pretty alright, aside from the weather and the large distances. This year, tickets didn't sell out IIRC, it's usually close whether that happens. 
Oh shit, these guys exist. I totally forgot about this lovely album.
Reading they do something like a Rhapsody Farewell tour with all the old members made me cry for joy. I hope I can catch them somewhere.
Awww hell yes.  Bal-Sagoth rules.
im still waiting on my copy of the vinyl remaster to arrive.  can't wait to get it.  apparently you get access to something special if you buy the remastered vinyls of the first 3 bal-sagoth albums.  only black moon has been released so far though...

The black moon vinyl was pricey but i dont give a shit.  i love bal-sagoth.
#Upcoming Events 

* **Shreddits Secret Satan (Thursday 11/24)**

This will be posted as its own thread and will be linked in the sidebar with an appropriate holiday picture. If you want to see a clusterfuck of pintrest, just search "heavy metal christmas" and look at the minefield of stupidity I was looking through last night. 

* **Heavy Metal Holidays**: 

Every album of the week for the month of December will come in pairs and be presented as a super team. You have all been good this year, except for the Phil Anselmo thread, and the mods wanted to give you all more music and introduce you to 8 albums you most likely havent heard, don't shake the box....it is not Megadeth nor an iPhone 7. 

* **Best Demos / EPs / Splits / Compilations of 2016 (12/17)**

Despite the aneurysm /u/doedanzee is having about us having this with 13 days left in the calendar year, we are just going to have one half of our end of the year celebrations throwing confetti on those releases that never get any recognition unless you are Gorguts and the blog writer didn't listen to any other albums and who is going to know? Come celebrate some of the best releases that only a few have heard in a small parking lot overlooking the stadium where Metallica is having their parade. 

 




I've never listened to metal until maybe a week ago. I'm not even sure what I was doing, I think I was curious what it was and searched "Slayer" and just started listening to Raining Blood since it's their most popular song on Google Play Music. Now I'm on this subreddit, listening to the stuff in the WHYBLT thread (Really liking Ulver - Bergtatt, Saor - Guardians, Master's Hammer - Ritual, and Insomnium - Winter's Gate btw). I even started playing drums again, after not touching my drum set for ~6 months (I used to play in my high school jazz band, now it's just a hobby). I can't believe I never knew about all this!
Why oh why do bands/venues sacrifice clarity for loudness at shows? I understand that one of metal's draws for people is the energy it generates in a live setting, hence the volume. But you know what generates energy? Fat fucking riffs, which I can't distinguish when you'd rather just try to blow out some eardrums.

Also, how on earth do people ever go to concerts without ear plugs?
What collaborations would you like to see hetween artists? 

I'd love to see Gnaw Their Tongues team up with Anaal Nathrakh; I feel it could restore that claustrophobic evil of their early releases, and even surpass it.

As massive fan of 80s pop culture but so-so on 80s pop music, seeing a solid retro-synthwave artist like Pertubator or VHS-Glitch team up with a retro-thrash (Havok) or retro heavy (like Evil Invaders) to give a more wholistic cheesy 80s album would be sick!

Lastly, I don't know who they would blend best with, but seeing the main man behind Wardruna contribute with either a folk black or atmoblack band would be sick. My favourite atmoblack's are Saor and Panopticon, but i dont think the Nordic style would gel. Maybe Falkenback?

Discussions have been brought up from time to to time about favorite album art and now that we are entering into the end of the year, I wanted to see what everyone's favorite artwork was this year that wasn't Hardwired to Self Destruct because let us be honest, we don't want this fight to be unfair.  To post, **please supply a High Res link AND the artist or designer.** Photofiltered images of Gustave Dore do not count rather original artwork or design.

I personally love the elitism in metal. Its not all metal.
What
/u/UnanimatedFelix come back, you can blame it all on me...
These new Metallica songs all sound really dull, why are people talking about them like they're good?
Inquisition and Mayhem are coming to Minneapolis in January! I saw Mayhem two years ago, they weren't that good live. I'm particularly excited to see Inquisition. Has anyone caught this tour yet? 
I finally bit the bullet and spent $150 on Devin Townsend's, "Ziltoid The Omniscient" LP. The mix is absolute perfection and this record is now my prized possession. 
Just found out today that Hammerfall are releasing a 10 album, 18 LP limited edition boxset next year. I really want it. What are some special edition releases you've got?
Looking for bands like alunah or acid king.  Slow doom female vocals.  Gimme your best. 
So, this is an odd lineup: http://www.brooklynvegan.com/blink-182-playing-first-ever-norway-show-with-black-metal-bands/
"Agent Orange" "We Are the Black Wizards" and "All the Small Things" don't seem like they would have a ton of crossover appeal.

Though I suppose I like all three, so that throws my theory out the window.

[looooool](http://tonsofrock.no)
Are there any bands you think have a perfect discography? The only two I could think of looking through my library are:

Death

Vektor

Obviously there are some one album or two album bands that would fit the bill, but I was trying to limit it to three albums or more.
What would you consider an acceptable price ballpark in buying an album? Like a full release ~45-60 min album. I know every release is different, but there has to be somewhere to aim for. A nearly $20 thirty min "atmospheric" black metal album seems overvalued while somewhere around 10 dollars seems a bit better if anything . I mean if it's a release I like I'll pay more obviously, but what is a good average to aim for? 
Who's doing NBBMN here? And whos' stayed Trve to it? 
Can we just quickly appreciate how good this year has been for traditional heavy metal? I don't listen to heavy metal as much as I do some other genres but there have been a great number of top quality releases this year.
So I went to the Disturbed concert here in New Zealand on Friday night. It was awesome, they really put on a good show regardless of how you feel about their music. The lighting and pyrotechnics were great, you could hear the separate instruments all clearly (and the bass was...there). You can tell they really enjoy playing their music, David was waving his hands around like a conductor for the pyro, Dan was putting on a little show every time he saw a camera pointed at him and singing along to all the choruses even when he didn't have a mic in front of him. 

As per /u/SoyBeanExplosion's request I paid close attention to the band shirts present... it was pretty bad. By the time everyone had been past the merch booth about half to two-thirds of the crowd had Disturbed shirts on with a handful of Devilskin (the opening act) ones. Everyone else was just wearing an assortment of the most generic band shirts available, mostly Metallica and Iron Maiden, a bunch of Slipknot, Korn etc. I saw one single battle vest and it had metalcore patches all over it.
i usually never purchase anything off of bandcamp but i have been unable to find any streaming service that has the new quicksand dream album. I Have been hyped the ever living hell out of this album so i really hope its worth the purchase. At the very least im supporting the band
So I booked tickets to see Anthrax in February. They're my least favourite of the big 4 but they're still a classic band so I bought a ticket when I saw they would be in the city closest to me.

Anyone seen them recently? Are they good live?
So my friend tagged me in a picture that was like one of those "you are what you listen to" and on the bottom was some baphomet in like a burning church. I bought a Black Witchery cd on Friday, and was looking through the booklet, and that exact picture was in the booklet. It was a funny coincidence.

On that note, I've been listening to a bit more war metal. Been hitting Black Witchery hard, and I've also been digging Caveman Cult. I'm admittedly liking both these bands more than Revenge, which were my introduction to the scene. 

I also ordered the Bat debut album on white vinyl as a Christmas gift for my dad, can't wait to give it to him! 
Still waiting for the Monolith Deathcult's remastered Trivmvirate to arrive at its destination.
How much do you think what you grew up listening to affects your future musical preferences, specifically production values?  Obviously a lot of this community loves "raw" production, I'm wondering if those are the same people who started on Metallica, Morbid Angel, etc.  I grew up on not-classic bands like Disturbed and Linkin Park, and find that I prefer clean production (like newer Cannibal Corpse and Cattle Decapitation).  I oppose drum triggers/machines on principle, but find that I love the sound they can give (Fear Factory, Anaal Nathrakh)
I'm really in love with the new Khemmis, "Hunted"

And it came out last year but the latest Cattle Decapitation is amazing  
Are there bands that mix punk and metal, but are not hardcore punk? (Does that even make any sense?) 

I'm just sitting here listening to AFI's "The Art of Drowning" and thinking *man, I'd love a metal version of this*.
Been watching Satanic Warmaster live videos, the new Mayhem live videos, and Blood Chalice live videos. Any good black metal live recordings, preferably with video, that I should check out?
Does anyone still use Last.fm on the regular? 

Just recently got back into using it and had to create a new account. Since it's impossible to scrobble tapes and vinyl I stopped using it. 
http://www.last.fm/user/Doom-Guild
I'm trying to make a "Best of Black Metal" playlist on Spotify. So far I only have around 10 songs. The playlist is collaborative so you guys can add tracks that you think should be on it. Here's the [link.](https://open.spotify.com/user/apocalyptictac/playlist/31Vb15BNpHGQOhxI8q56BM)
Hey hey, I know I'm always late to this thread sorry (West Coast, man)

So last week I started asking questions about this new **Antaeus** album, because some people liked it and I was full of  meh for it. 

Anyways, it was recommended (by /u/HighwayCorsair and /u/dzorrilla )  that I listen to all of their albums first, then revisit this new release. I did that, and I'm back with my response. 

It's still a big meh. In fact, all of the albums were pretty meh for me, including *Blood Libels*. 

I find it interesting that something like **[Antaeus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDu2zjVnrJI)** will sound fairly uninteresting to me, while something like **[Vajass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2jkaXiW6pQ)** will immediately grab my attention. 

What's the difference here? And do people feel the same way about the two songs linked? 

Personally, I think **Antaeus** suffers from not changing their riffs within their songs enough and they don't have punchy moments or flourishes with either the drums or guitar in the way that **Vajass** does. 
I really love death metal! But I refuse to listen to anything Satanic. It's not my cup of tea, and I don't like it. I don't care if anyone else listens to it, I just simply don't wanna hear it. I haven't found a band like Behemoth, (which sounds awesome!)  that wasn't about that kind of stuff. Any suggestions? The death/doom metal bands I listen to are:

Children of Bodom
Obituary
Death
Morbid Angel
Decapitated
Whitechapel
Zoroaster
Windhand
Heavy Lord


Of these, are they super Satanic? Excuse the silliness of the question, just wanted to get a feel if I'm being a hypocrite or if these are 'just as Satanic' as stuff like Behemoth and Ghost BC
[Loudwire's Top 25 Extreme Metal Albums of All Time](https://play.spotify.com/user/homars06/playlist/30kBrD7XO5aZSX75uX4IZI)

Hi everyone!

I've made a playlist based in Loudwire's Top 25 Extreme Metal Albums of All Time (Check it [Here](http://loudwire.com/top-extreme-metal-albums/) )

I think it's a nice list for those who want to get into metal or give a second listen to those "Yeah, i know it's a clasic, but i just don't get it".
Hope you like it!
I'm in my late 40s – can anyone recommend some new metal for me to listen to? I'm not much of a fan of the Cookie Monster style vocals. As long as the singer/vocalist is pretty decent & the music is nice & neck snappy, I'll check it out.

Also, how are the new Death Angel/Testament/Metallica albums? Worth picking up?
Do you guys think the mayhem/inqusition tour would be a good first metal concert experience?
I've heard people say that Slough Feg's Digital Resistance album take a good bit of influence from Iron Maiden but I'm not really seeing it, anyone care to point out specific examples? 

Side note, how fucking great is Analogue Avengers / Bertrand Russell's Sex Den? It's my favourite Slough Feg song despite Traveler being my favorite album by em.
I bought my first item off of bandcamp (as opposed to ordering from the band's site, eMusic, spotify, or getting it in person) and now I have an account [here](https://bandcamp.com/goniloc).

I need people to follow! Drop a link to your profile and I'll check it out.
Anyone have experience with ordering CD's from Osmose Productions on bandcamp? Does it redirect you to their webshop, or is the bandcamp storefront just the same/separate?
[deleted]
Can someone recommend me a good site for patches? US distro preferred but if I can find something neat I don't mind overseas shipping.
I got a maudlin of the Well shirt! And ordered a Choirs of The Eye one!
I want to get balls deep into some death metal. I really like Death (early particularly), Vader, Amon Amarth, Kalmah and Entombed. I'm more into melodic or technical stuff rather than slower, chuggier stuff. What bands would you recommend I listen to?
Does anyone know where I can buy Torture Chain's releases? Download or CD. I can't find anywhere its available for sale.
Morbid Angel has a lot "satanic" imagery in their lyrics. 
Some bands to check out,
Job for a Cowboy
Pig Destroyer
Suffocation 
Cannibal Corpse 
Cryptopsy
Dragged into sunlight 
I spontaneously picked up Doomriders - Black Thunder and Acid Tiger - Self Titled on vinyl. Scored doomriders for 15 on amazon, limited edition purple swirl vinyl. Found Acid Tiger on Deathwish Records' site for 5 bucks. I'm pretty stoked and wanted to share. Any really good places online to find vinyl? Obviously eBay, or going straight to the record company's site, but any one stop shops that have a lot of metal albums?
Does any metal with a baritone or bass singer as intensely manly as Jag Panzer's [Cardiac Arrest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESkoh7SsysM) exist?

I don't think so. I've looked pretty  hard for stuff that's quite that manly, and even bands like Manowar, Heavy Load, Ironsword, and Vicious Rumors can't quite measure up. 
Why all the hate for Trivium?
******What the fuck is wrong with you people? 

**OK guys, seriously, why does nobody think about song lyrics when you are listening? 

This shit is basic psychology and literally nobody is even considering that song lyrics and themes are the most important thing your mind can hold.

If you are listening to music and the music does not feed your brain, why the hell are you listening to it? 

When I listen do certain "underground death metal bands," I will listen for the musical tones and rythems that they play. If they add litteraly nothing to the genre why the fuck are you listening to it? 

Instead go check out some super, side project like work, something like ensiferum, eluveitie, nightwish, ulver, etc. I mean seriously guys what the fuck is wrong with you? Get a fucking life. Basic psychology can teach you more then any computer programing, more then literally any other thing. Why the hell does nobody take psycholofy 101?

Ok, rant over. You heard it here first. 


**************Signed - Bringer of Justice, Destroyer of Fate, Night of The Rising Sun.

PS. Litteraly what the fuck is wrong with the world. Grow the fuck up and get a fucking life. 

PS, I'm serious, you guys have no argument, get the fuck over yourselves and get a real fucking life.
[deleted]
Probably just the really ringy/underproduced snare
Can you provide an example?
It's probably the snare's high tuning/ lots of reverb from lo-fi reverb filled production.
AOTY for me.
Great album. Been listening to it a lot lately. 
Killer riffs, some great solos and great production, but the vocals just completely kill it for me. I'm going to be giving it a couple more listens in the hopes that they will "click".
The guys in this band are real jerks
Great album
Fun fact: I met a guy at California Deathfest this year with a sweet Molested shirt and when I complimented it, he showed me that he has Blod-draum's art tattooed on his upper arm. Was a pretty cool dude, gotta say. 
If you really have a void in your life that you must fill with Star Wars themed metal, there's always Hoth
I am going to assume that novelty bands or bands with a heavy concept are less able to keep it together. 
here's return of the jedi live: (1/2) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1gDYBtb3vo

The guitar dude sounds like Jake E Lee and Randy Rhoads combined in one
Amazing album. If you're short on cash... https://undergang.bandcamp.com/album/d-den-l-ger-alle-s-r
Are these guys danish or norwegian playing out of colorado? Undergang means Apocalypse or Demise and Radbrækket means something like back-broken.
Oh I like! 
Really cool album. And yet, somehow, I keep forgetting about it. I don't know what it is that makes me grab other records when I'm in the mood for this kind of usbm. 
Coldworld rules. Autumn is the soundtrack to my divorce though...
This album is fucking outstanding. Perfect atmosphere for the cold weather. 
I was on a holiday in Spain when this came out and it didn't really make an impact. I tried it then, and I liked a song or two. But as an album, it's atmosphere totally fell flat in 35 degrees on a beach. Now, while reading the topic on [album of the week Brave Murder Day](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/5e3n0p/shreddits_album_of_the_week_katatonia_brave/) I suddenly remembered *Autumn*, and my intention to revisit it when days and temperatures - among other things - would shrink. And man, it totally hits me now. 


I can't say *Autumn* is anything like *Brave Murder Day*. The atmosphere on Autumn is completely different, more derived from Burzum than the Swedish melodic death/doom scene like BMD, but I think people who enjoy that legendary, beautiful Katatonia record, will enjoy this one too.
This is cool but I definitely prefer melancholy ² especially because of the snow
this music sounds kind of like thrashy black metal. i get that the vocals and general mood of the music would call it black metal, but is all black metal thrashy like this? i'm terrible with genres. i do like thrash though.

this might be very out of place here, seeing as it's not black metal at all, but this came to mind and i felt like sharing it in case others like it: [November's Doom - Autumn Reflection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0oQ7ZOKTls)

Definitely digging this album, got the CD back in October and it got a handful of listens in the car.
Yet to fully dig in to this album but I've enjoyed my first few spins. Look forward to an LP version, the artwork looked awesome on the CDs. 
I used to know a guy who'd get upset when I'd call this album "In Death of Sylvester Stallone". Solid album though, "Heavy Demons" is my personal favourite though.
I wouldn't call this Black, but pretty good song
Fuck yea dude! One of my favorite demos! 
Been trying to find a copy of this for a while 
lol, I had forgotten about this release.

FFO: cartoon tow trucks 
Sounds great. I don't understand the downvotes.
Solid band, excited for this!

dope album cover.
Only Canadian Revenge is real!
Galder is talented as fuck. I'd love some new material.
All the best parts of the early 2000's era Dimmu Borgir, even with Nicholas Barker on drums. Hell yeah!
One of the first metal cds i bought. I knew nothing about the band, the style of nusic they played, anything. I liked the cover art, and figured that was enough justification.
Old Mans Child are one of the reasons I started to love black metal. They're just an excellent band.
First OMC song I ever heard.  It was on some century media compilation promo cd I got whenever this album dropped.  Such a great song and album. Galder is one of the best riff writers in metal, in my opinion.  Constantly churning out great shit.

The Millennium King, In Torments Orbit, Black Marvels of Death, Enslaved and Condemned, The Underworld Domains... all have insanely tasty riffs and melodies.
I wish they'd come out with new stuff
I totally forgot this album exists.
OMC really shines on The Pagan Prosperity and Ill-Natured Spiritual Invasion. This album is good, but the sound started merging with Dimmu Borgir too much for my taste here. I do agree though that a new album is long overdue. 
no one deserves happiness 
Good stuff, one of my favorites from this year.
this whole album is fucking amazing
Wow. You now have my attention!
Checking out the full release now. 
Definitely will find it's way into my top 10 for the year... Been quite lucky and have gotten to see these guys live 4 times in about the last year and a half.

Looking forward to their show next year with Alcest, despite the pairing being pretty odd.
> you can't deny that Tool has influenced metal bands.

I can deny that they've had any sort of widespread, meaningful influence, because they haven't. 
I would argue that bands like [Swans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLTQrt31SOM) had a larger influence on the strange exploratory bands. I think if you went to a metal festival, you would see more Swans shirts than you would Tool. 

If we are talking influence, you are talking about a range of albums going from 1993-2006. At that point, black and death metal were already in full swing and further developments in even progressive metal took cues from Meshuggah. If you are talking about musicians probably growing up with tool albums, sure but I think you are overstating the band's importance.  
I like them but they are not influential or groundbreaking.

I seem to recall them being friendly with the Melvins, though, who were somewhat influential albeit not necessarily always within the metal genre.
Tool falls into a category I like to call Jock Rock.
Dudes, I think we always overlook how chumbawamba's styles have been incorporated into metal.
Metal has been incredibly stale for 20 years now. It's really dead, in terms of innovation.

Thank dog for Slayer, otherwise there would be nothing new to listen to.
I'm sorry but it's not Metal is it. I know who they are, but this doesn't belong here. 

Also with that album cover I can only think about [Devvo.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stPqr6B_zEY)
Have you heard their new album ?
One of quite a few ToPT tunes that rocked my world back in the day.  And I still enjoy them.

Suzie Smiled.
Am I the only one that hears a bit of Heart's Barracuda in this?
This is some good shit man.
Really fun local band that kills live. 
That guy's right hand is unstoppable.  Noice!
There will never be enough Hansi in my life.
EUPM gets a bad rap, - rightly so most of the time - but Angra is fucking good shit. 
This is my summer album..  I love blasting this album in my car the first solid day of summer!!  One of my fav's in the genre!!!!
There is a 50% chance if you are listening to an album made in Sweden during the 90's, it was probably engineered or at least had a couple of knobs turned by Dan Swanö. You may not even know about it. It may even be by accident when you are looking at production credits and Dan Swanö appears in the back of an old photo from 100 years ago over creepy musicbox melodies. [Oh shit there he is up in the window!](http://i.imgur.com/6bDvarF.jpg) Whether you want him or not he appears like an apparition for Katatonia's second release. Add to this a band that is already famous for its lead singer also doing an obscure side project called Opeth and an album cover that looks like the final from a 1st year sad photography student and you have cause for celebration in a cemetery with a couple of your friends who really like Edgar Allen Poe and Nightmare Before Christmas. 

#Fair Warning: This and the followup EP Sounds of Decay are the only proper releases with Mikael Åkerfeldt as a leading contributer. Don't get even more sad. 

I should point out that the use for "Melodic Death/Doom" can cause people to go into genre seizures and think everything has 4 descriptions like Melodic-Electro-sludge-core. Katanoia's death/doom along with Saturnus and October Tide have little to do and probably wouldn't get along with the traditional death/doom like Winter and Autopsy. If you wanted that fence in your yard of death doom, it is only intended to help as Katatonia's sound is dramatic and uses melodies to create atmosphere rather than attempting to pummel with a gravestone.  

Why are you listening to this today. Well, if you live in the States, you are probably planning a trip back to some sort of family epicenter and combined with traffic, this maybe the perfect soundtrack to you damn miserable existence. I am just joking, ya'll have cream corn and that shit is delicious. It has been fucking cold here the last few days and the wind has been something fierce. I can not think of a better soundtrack to clutch onto my jacket and say "holy shit...fuck this."

#EDIT: Holy shit, there are quite a lot of you doom fans, maybe *Yule-Tide Cruel Tide Doomcember* will be a thing. 


The version of Brave on the Last Fair Day Gone Night DVD is fucking awesome https://youtu.be/3UTv8V0cO-w 
As someone who loved all that Death/Doom from back in the day I just gotta ask. Why did they all veer away? Katatonia, Anathema, Amorphis. I'd kill for them all to go back to their roots, or at least do a tour together to acknowledge the older stuff. 

Also mad props to the only band in the Peaceville Three to stay true to the era. My Dying Bride. 
Probably in my Top 5 all time, Top 3 all time greatest dead bird album covers, quite possibly responsible for my move into Extreme Metal, and my deep love of the color purple. 

*Edit* - Listening Thoughts:

* The whole album's tone is what drew me to it. Like waking up hungover on an overly sunny Summer afternoon, sweating through the sheets, unable to block the out the light. Its incessant, with that college radio down-down down-down picking. 

* *Brave Murder Day* predicts DSBM, and could rightfully be called so with a bit more reverb and a bit less bass. 

* The solo-or-is-it-a-bridge-riff on "Brave" greets you with a bottle of pills and begs you to kill yourself. The color on the third riff outro resonates like a migraine, subtly burying the piano. Who wants to commit suicide with me?

* "Day" is the best song ever recorded. The auditory equivalent of cutting yourself to live. Fuck Trent Reznor.

* The real star of "Rainroom" could possibly be the Candlemass-esque break, but it's not. It's the subtle melody under the main riff. Pay attention asshole.

* We finally get a headbanging moment on "12". It's not quite worth it, as the quiet passages and melodies are what carry this song. Probably my least favorite track on the album, because it seems to try too hard to force [METAL](https://youtu.be/JQFI4wKubqs?t=4s) into an otherwise pleasantly depressing album. That outro doesn't make sense either, it never did. Was it an aborted 7th track? Was it contractually mandated?

* For some reason I keep thinking of *White Pony*. Maybe it's because I discovered this album around the same time that one was released. Maybe it's because they share similar warmth. 

* Katatonia, Kings of all that is Melodic in Metal, predict Blackgaze with "Endtime", which makes up for the forced nature of "12" by being genuinely heavy by design. Alcest can suck a dick. Neige is a closet Nazi. Katatonia are here to save us all. 

* One of my favorite parts of "Endtime" is that even today I fully expect Johan Längqvist to show up out of nowhere, soaring high on cool wings of sadness. Instead, Åkerfeldt lays a trail of breadcrumbs for a realization that we would only come to 15 years later - *Opeth isn't Metal*. 

* Fuck, I love this album. 
I listen to Katatonia on a daily basis, and have for a long time. One of my favorite bands still today. But this is one of there only albums I've never listened to all the way through, and I'm not sure why. I'll have to listen to this more today.
These guys are coming to my city in January. Should I go ? How are they live ?
Finally an album of the week that I've heard before :)
Love this album so much, although sometimes I think I prefer *Discouraged Ones*. Anders Nyström is one of my favourite guitarists, he has a really great way of writing melodies.
I first heard this on the legendary (at least to me and my homies) Firestarter compilation from Century Black, which had Murder as one of the tracks. It was one of my favorite songs on there, I just loved that steady open chord strumming and steady rock beat on the drums, definitely foreshadowing some of the modern ambient black metal and DSBM. It was actually one of the first songs I ever learned on drums back when I was learning in high school. It wasn't until quite a bit later that I heard the whole album, but Murder definitely stayed my favorite track, even if it was just a nostalgia thing.
YES

This is one of my favorite albums of all time. Such simple instrumentation that conveys such complex (mostly sad/melancholic) emotion. The main riff on Murder exemplifies this and might be my favorite riff of all time. Interesting how the droning melodies and rhythms are reiterated across different songs without coming off as repetitive. Acousting sections are done so well too, especially on Rainroom with that beautiful riff that eventually gets drowned out by the waves of distortion... But drowned peacefully, willingly even along the chanting vocals.

And of course, the melodies. Anyone who's listened to this knows the one on Endtime. I wish I could describe the feeling I get from melodies like this and Brave Murder Day in general but I really can't put my finger on it. A calm, serene sadness that slowly consumes...  Is there hints of anger or acceptance? A longing, nostalgia... For someone or something, maybe even homesickness? The feeling of no control... 

Don't think I'll ever stop lostening to this album :)

I can't believe I never knew that Akerfeldt on this
Thanks for reminding me to listen to more Katatonia. Actually since this album is around my ideal length I'm going to listen to it right now
This is one my favorite performances from Mikael Akerfeldt. I love the 90s Opeth albums to death, but his vocals at the time really lent themselves well to very sad melancholic music. I'd only really describe Morningrise as Sad, so this album scratches that itch perfectly. Also the guitar tone on this album is absolutely killer, you just know it's Swedish.
[deleted]
I have the Century Black version from 97 and it's actually got the entirety of "For Funerals to Come" as bonus tracks and it's actually a pretty marked difference between the two, but it's still an enjoyable bonus to have. Always felt this was stronger than "Sounds of Decay".
BMD is easily in my top 5 albums of all time. I even did a cover of Rainroom with a friend just because I loved them so much:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqIXIPo5S1o

 Sad that I've only seen Katatonia once and I don't remember them playing any BMD material. The album's tone and feel is just perfect. Great music to blast in the winter. 
Been awhile for awhile, suppose I should ease back in with the album of the week. 

I was a bit hesitant about giving this a listen. I'm not the biggest fan of what I've heard of death/doom (admittedly little), and I usually stay away from most stuff marked Melodic (don't know why). However, I figured that it'd be good to try something that I don't normally give a listen to. 

So, overall, this record is pretty dang good. The guitar tone is good, with enough of a bite to give it a death metal sound while still sounding unique against other 90's death bands. The bass (which I can hear! Sweet!) doesn't go for much in the flashiness department, but it provides a consistent backbone to the sound along with the drums. The drums, similarly, aren't very flashy, but they get the job done with enough fills and changes to keep things interesting. The keyboards are used very well, adding nice texture to the tracks. Finally, the vocals on this record are tremendous. While not my favorite of all time, they are well-varied, with plenty of force behind them. They really capture the mood of the album, at least for me, which is what I always look for in an album (incidentally, as someone who has never listened to Opeth, not surprised that people were unhappy with Akerfeldt switching to clean singing only. Damn fine growls from him on this record.)

Highlights:

* Murder (that intro riff!)

* Rainroom

* 12

And, worth mentioning, Day really threw me for a loop. Not in a bad way, mind you, but certainly odd. 

I feel like I need to give this record more listens (more than 1, anyhow) to say whether or not I enjoy it, but for now, it's pretty dang good. 
I love this album. Perfect for the rainy season.
I would call myself a Katatonia Hardcore Fan(buying every record with the name Katatonia, waiting and standing in front of venues for hours just for first row and so on)

And I ignored "Brave Murder Day" for so many years. I couldn't see how this is any good output in comparison to albums like The Great Cold Distance or Dead End Kings. Finally I gave it a shot and dear god, since this day I admire this piece of music. One of their best albums overall and I would kill to hear Brave live.
Fuck.  Yes.
So. Fucking. Good. 
This is another nice find.  Thanks!

Uncharacteristically, I'm actually finding the clean-vocal track, "Day", the least interesting here.  If I wanted to listen to The Cure or the Joy Division, I would.  "Brave", however, is brilliant and the rest of the album is pretty good, too.
Akerfeldt's best shoegaze album.
The atmosphere on this album is unreal. It's like being trapped in a nightmare, anxiety and apprehension swirling around you incessantly. At the same time there's a melancholy beauty to it all. It's oddly comforting to be trapped in the depths of this album. I fucking love Katatonia, and this album is one of my favorites, just below Discouraged Ones. 
This is an amazing album. I could listen to the riff from 'Brave' forever. It's hypnotic. 

I never really managed to get into anything they did after BMD. A bit too Cure cross bad MDB for me. 

Guess I know what I'm listening to tonight now. 

Also, obligatory #MakeMikaelGrowlAgain
Got this album when it was released (i now feel old) still one of my faves.  Just the atmosphere and raw feeling they managed to capture with this album is phenomenal.  

Even now when it's a really cold overcast day I'll get lyrics of "day" going through my head 
I listened to this album like 4 times in a row last night. I had never heard it before. I woke up suicidal. So that's cool.
Hey an AOTW that is good and not dad rock!
*smirks*



You poor, weak, spineless fools. Oh, how I pity thee, to think you know good, quality music. And yet, I envy you, having minds so base and primal that you lack the difficulties of an intellectual like me. It is hard, even for someone as intelligent as me, to imagine listening to *scoffs* Brave Murder Day over higher quality death-doom like My Dying Bride-A Line Of Deathless Kings, or Runemagick-Enter the Realm Of Death. Truly, truly pathetic. Tell me, fleas... Do your feeble minds have to constantly focus on breathing lest you forget and suffocate on your own stupidity? One look at your musical tastes, and I would believe that to be the case.



Now, this is the last time I will converse with you intellectually-devoid critters, but I implore you... Leave this subreddit. /r/Metal is meant for true metal connoisseurs, who enjoy the subtle melodies of Draconian and Paradise Lost and Thou and Blind Guardian. Keep listening to your disgusting "music", fools, but please don't infest MY subreddit with your lack of taste. With that I leave you, heathen. 



*departs with a tangible air of triumph*
I can't say I'm a massive fan of this style, but Katatonia does a great job here. For me, this sounds like The Cure circa Pornography mixed with death metal. Mikael Akerfeldt's vocals perfectly convey the feeling of sorrow and despair that rings throughout the whole album. The kind of album you play while walking on a dreary, rainy day.

I still get chills listening to [Endtime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23NdT-xletg), probably my favourite track off the record and a beast of a closer as it perfectly encapsulates the bleak and melancholic tone they set out to achieve. Love the Shining sample as well.
Good album. I need to hit it again.

Okay now for the reason I'm commenting, it's off topic but I'm not waiting 'til the next general thread: *holy shit /u/UnanimatedFelix deleted his account*. Anyone know why? I never talked to the guy really but his was a name I always recognized favorably.
I firmly believe that *Dance of December Souls* is better. *Brave Murder Day* is weird because it's almost trance-y to me. I don't listen to the music as much as I end up thinking through it. 
____________________________________

**WHAT I AM ABOUT TO SAY MAY TRIGGER SOME PEOPLE**

Honestly, as much as I love Katatonia, I feel like this record is so hyped and jerked because of Akerfeldt's prescence. I have often thought that this record would be over looked by a larger audience if he didn't do the vocals but because he did, you have your r/progmetal fanboys leaking over it becaue Akerfeldt. Admittedly, when I do think of this, I get unnecessarily angered by it - even though it's hypothetical. 
the release that fundamentally shifted AvantGarde music . 


Dam what a beautiful album 
Man, whenever i don't know what to listen to, i can always count on this sub for some legitimately good stuff i havent heard before. Thanks
Yeah, I love this album. They really had something special here.

Not death metal though. Fight me.
On any given day of the week, if you asked me what my favorite album is, I'd offer up Brave Murder Day. There's nothing else like it. 

I bought this when I was in 9th grade I think. It was a blind purchase, but someone had told me the singer from Opeth was on it, and I was a big fan of Morningrise and My Arms Your Hearse at that time. It took some time to grow on me, but now... well, as mentioned, it's probably my favorite album. It's influenced every piece of music I've written.

They weren't even really trying to do a metal thing, and if I remember correctly, were listening mostly to Slowdive when they recorded this. an original member wanted to bring the band in a more "gothic" direction, and another member (sorry I can't remember which was which) wanted to go in this more shoegazey direction. I think they made the right choice. I can't get into anything else they did after this, besides the EP that came out around the same time, but this is their absolute peak to me. 
I'm a fan of slow, atmospheric stuff. Lots of Doom and Black Metal without many riffs, more to get lost in. But this style does nothing for me. The standout track on this is 'Day', basically the Cure track. The rest of it is pretty samey and standard? I don't get the draw.
Always liked this album, it's cool as hell! Traces of Edge Of Sanity can be heard unsurprisingly but it's definitely its own beast.
This is a really unique album because it has such a huge keyboard presence. Shit is catchy.
If Rush made death meal in the '70s.
never heard of them. I'll be checking this album out today thanks.
To this day, still their 2nd best track.  (Those of the Night)

My jaw hit the floor the first time I heard this album almost 20 years ago.   Probably one of the 10-20 albums I still listen to weekly no matter what.  I guess that means I've listened to it about 1000 times now.  Wow. 



It took me so many tries to get past the vocals but once I did, I was so happy that I could finally appreciate these guys. Recently binged before the new album and bought all their cd's, as well as the box set of the new album. Going to be seeing them in January, so stoked!
Damn this is some good black metal.
For Fans of: Cosmic Frogs killed me
Hmm cool. I discovered this band from their new album. Interesting to hear their roots. I'm surprised at how close they stick to them.
This band live. Holy shit. Dagon is probably one of the sickest frontmen I know of, i dont think i saw him look at his guitar a single time during the entire show. Insane amount if skill. And the fact that the entire band is 2 people..
Love his voice. I need to check out more Japanese metal.
I'm tempted to get it because I love subscription boxes (but I'm only getting Legion of Collectors at the moment), but there's a big problem with this box. 

If I'm a death metal fan, that doesn't mean I'm a fan of *all* death metal. I wouldn't wear a Mayhem or Children of Bodom shirt because I like a few songs by both bands but not enough to warrant wearing a shirt for them. The posters are the same problem (even though I would hang up that Megadeth poster, who knows whats next).

And then the CDs. If you find a new CD you love, that would be absolutely amazing to receive in the mail. If it turns out you don't like the music, then you're stuck with a bad CD with very little opportunity for resale. 

I realize the whole point of mystery boxes is "who knows what you'll get?", but most other boxes give you a theme or something. Like Legion of Collectors: If the theme is Green Lantern Corps, I like the Green Lantern Corps, so whatever merch I get I know I will enjoy to some degree. If it's a Jimmy Olsen box, I know I won't want it so I'll skip out that box. With the metalhead box, it's difficult to announce the bands that will be represented without spoiling the box. Maybe a label announcement? I don't know.

Box aside though, this unboxing was painfully long. These things should take three minutes, I don't want to sit through all of this, even on 2x speed.
On mobile, can't watch. What'd you get?
Not too bad, certainly worth the $30
I really wish I could find a copy of this LP, it's so off-the-walls weird and good.
Saw these folk several times years ago. Brings me back, fun band.
I cant remember how I found this band all those years ago, but it was such a good find
Man, I need to vent about something, and this post is the only thing related enough, so I'm venting here:

I had a customer the other week tell me that fucking Bodycount was the first Black Metal band because Ice-T was in it.  I tried to correct him, but he just nodded, smiled, and said, "Yeah, but, I'm pretty sure it was Ice-T's band that started the trend, because they had this heavy metal, but it was a bunch of black guys and they didn't know what else to call it!"  

Variations of this conversation went on for about a half hour.  It was then that I gave up.  It was a pretty mild conversation, because I'm not one to argue.  Maybe it was his aw-shucks persona.  Guy looked about fifty, knew a decent amount about music, compared to the usual crowd that comes in.  He was just so sure about the Body Count thing, though.  The nerd inside me screamed.
I would love it if the black metal "trend" would end because then I wouldn't have to read shitty articles about Deafheaven being the greatest, most innovative band ever that is "saving" black metal. If people like that stuff that's fine, I don't and I don't really think of it as black metal because it doesn't evoke the same feeling I get from more traditional bands. I'm just tired of tourists acting like they know shit about black metal or metal in general.
> as a way to instantly tag themselves or their new favourites with a spurious (and largely unearned) sense of underground credibility

> I’ve already seen certain individuals who once spent their time praising Black Metal for its more philosophical and occult leanings suddenly pulling an abrupt about-face and starting to mock the more spiritual or philosophical elements of the style, because it’s not “cool” anymore

Do these things really happen?  Outside of high school kids trying to look cool?  And if they do, who cares?  Why can't we just say: some people are being faddish and shallow.  That's not news.
The moment that 'black metal' started tolerating bands experimenting in what is largely the realm, ethos, and aesthetics of weepy and wimpy teenagers  (emo/gaze/post-/etc) it was open-season for the stupidity the article is complaining about.  It just took about 10 years to actually 'get here'.  Ironically enough, the article highlights a lot of counterpoint bands that are simply 'cool' (inside the 'scene')  because they sit on the metaphorical saddle point between old school (and modern renditions of old school) BM and this crappy non-BM 'BM'.  In the other directions on the saddle of course you have your true avant-garde fusion offerings, and then the tried and true hybrids like black/thrash, industrial BM, etc.    Unfortunately, just like how in the 80's you had idiots who asked you "you like metal too?  My favorite band is Ratt", {similarly for Korn/etc in the late 90s} now you have this.   The infighting and 'stale factor' amongst toe-in-the-water fans and true lifer/enthusiasts led to an apathy for correct labeling then, just as now.   And here we are come half circle.  I guess in 30 more years we'll have come back to a debate over metal vs non-metal. 
Will we ever learn that the solution is to strive for intellectual (not necessarily ideological) purity?  If so, the music will work itself out. 


>a sack full of weasels having hate-sex in a steel drum.

I now have a new way of describing the sound of all my favorite bands.  Normally I just tell people that black metal sounds like a cat going through a cheese-grater.
Pretty sure black metal is black metal, and blackgaze, postblack metal, black n roll, blackened death metal/deathcore, etc are not black metal. Don't really see an issue with it. 

Of course you can make arguments that these are sub-genres of black metal, but they really aren't. You can very clearly be influenced by black metal, but it definitely doesn't make it a subgenre of black metal. I'd still say there is room for subgenres in black metal, such as avant-garde, folk/viking, atmospheric, progressive, and even some really punk influenced stuff can still be counted as black metal. 

Still, we need to keep in mind that genre infusions are just as old as genres themselves, so we shouldn't confuse genre infusions with subgenres. 

From the article:

>But, that being said, I am very wary of an unpleasant trend which I’ve observed over the last several years, where anything with even the tiniest amount of tremolo picking or harsh vocals seems to be labelled as “Black Metal”, without any regards for whether this is an accurate (or appropriate) reflection of the band in question.

I just don't see how this is a problem. There are far more people with no idea of black metal in this world than those who have an idea. It's very obvious that everything we hear about black metal isn't accurate, so statements on if something is or isn't black metal really should never be held at face value. Indeed, it sounds preposterous. DAE Ghost.B.C. IS BLACK METAL? Obviously Ghost isn't black metal, and has no association, and even if I say it, it doesn't make it so. My statement should just be ignored.

>One big contributor to this issue is that the term “Black Metal” seems to have become a bit of a buzz-word for certain bands and certain sections of the music press

Well fuck the press then. Music press isn't the worst in the world, but they're not infallible. Most mainstream publications definitely lack the knowledge of black metal, even if they deal with metal every day (looking at you, MetalCucks). No reason to take anything they say with face value, but of course if their reasoning is good enough, then sure, we'll listen.

> but that doesn’t mean that every Tøm, Dick, and Ahriman who owns an Emperor album or a Wolves In The Throne Room shirt has a right to call their music “Black Metal”, just because it makes them sound cool.

Again, the author clearly has a problem with people calling something black metal. It's not a problem, because their words are useless.

>It’s also interesting to note that I’ve seen and heard a number of people making the claim that Black Metal’s recent crossover with both Hardcore and Post-Rock means that “Black Metal is finally good now”.

Well, black metal influences being brought to these other genres might definitely be exactly what some people have been yearning for. Unapologetic, high tempo version of a genre they've always been listening to. That still doesn't take anything away from such music, and it definitely doesn't make it black metal.

My point here simply is that it doesn't matter if bands think they're the cvltest of black metal, or labels think that, fans think that, or someone on the internet thinks that. It's just their opinion, and it holds no value. Earth used to be thought to be solid, some people still don't believe in climate change, and many people still believe in religion. They believe these things, even if they don't have any basis in facts or reality. It really doesn't matter, since it won't take anything away from the reality, it won't take away from the original ideas, that are based on fundamentals that simply cannot be swayed. 

So whatever. Those other issues that are more widely misunderstood and mislabeled might have some real world implications, but real black metal will never be worse just because some vvimps and falses misunderstand it.


The title made me think I mistakenly stumbled into r/shitthefalsesay. 
Reasons like this is why I don't put much mental energy into sub-genres. I like the music to speak for itself. Often I find subgenres is just an association that is unrelated to the music itself. /u/SoyBeanExplosion makes a good point that many of the most influential black metal artists consider the label to mean more than just the music. I can't remember who said it, but one of the old-school dudes believes black metal must be satanic. Subgenres can still be helpful in linking ideas and tastes, but I find there's too much baggage that comes with them.

> And by “interesting”, I mean “incredibly frustrating”.

I'm so glad that I missed the entire indie-music critic circle-jerk over Deafheaven (and the subsequent reaction to it), because I now I can just listen to the band and enjoy them for what they are.

Oh no Oh No Oh No....oh...its not that bad, I thought it was going to be someone calling me out for something I haven't done. It is an interesting article on the use of the word black metal and probably the cognitive dissonance when one comes into the genre from the fringe genres and then listens to Bathory, Root, Darkthrone or old Rotting Christ.  
I don't think this is something there will ever be agreement on. I think as a genre, black metal is particularly open to very different interpretations. Some people argue that it really just comes down to certain musical characteristics - use of fast tempos, shrieked vocals, fast, tremolo-picked guitar passages, raw production, etc.

But if you listen to many of the artists that have historically been hugely influential on black metal - Such as Burzum, Mayhem, Dissection, or more recently Watain (arguably one of the biggest black metal bands on the planet) - they see it as being much more than just that. It's also about what drives you, the topics you're focusing on lyrically and musically, your sources of inspiration, your ideology, religious views, etc. For some it's Satanism, for others it's Paganism, or a reverence of some particular culture or history, etc.

On this view, black metal is a much more all-encompassing term, and in that sense it's much more demanding: it's not enough that you play the 'mimic' the style. And honestly... I kind of think there might be something to that. It's something I'm going to think about further, but if you're playing a black metal style of music while your vocalist is telling the audience about God's endless love and forgiveness, I don't know dude, I question whether you're playing black metal or just using the aesthetic.
lol
Well, there sure is a lot of trve kvlt-ism in this thread. 

Is this what I have to look forward to now that I've been getting into black metal?
Srsly, who the fuck cares what's a band categorized as? You could call ColdWorld or Sterbend pop-polka it'd be still awesome.
And the clean vocals on some albums, tracks are great and give so much to the song. Example Austere - To Lay Like Old Ashes album.
Yass. I have the tape of this, hoping that new ep drops relatively soon.
Hearing Hawk As Weapon live was one of the better experiences of Psycho California last year. 
I was expecting power metal
[We got to chatting after the show and Matt Pike turned to me and said, “What do you tune to?” So I explained that we tune to drop-F. And he said, “Oh, my god. We watched you from the side of the stage and I had to go and have a shit, it was so heavy!” And I was like, “Okay, that is probably the coolest compliment ever!”](https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/rock-flag-and-blood-eagle-getting-heavy-with-conan)
Conan's fucking sweet.  I gotta say that Blood Eagle is my favorite by them.  The tone and atmosphere are slightly more to my liking, and the [album art](http://metalrecusants.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Conan-Blood-Eagle.jpg) is killer.
This band has the unique ability to make me feel stoned even in the absence of any actual intake. I'm not even exaggerating; these riffs make me all hazy in the head.
Love these guys.  I saw them play in a tiny room and it was overwhelming.
This band resonates with me like no other.
Make Amorphis death/doom again.
Definitely has their signature sound. I'm looking forward to it!
Note: This is not the final mix. Apparently this is the "facebook version".
Great live band, vocalist is a monster. Pretty sure it was during their set that /u/greatthunderowl body slammed a crowd killer, too, which is a memory that regardless of the set I will always hold dear. 
Finally got to see these guys after having been a fan for years, and they definitely lived up to the hype in my head.
Love this band, although Never Cross the Dead is still my favorite by them.
This is pretty fantastic, first time I've listened to them.
 *Fulfill the Curse* is definitely my favorite album, but *Darkness Drips Forth* is such a bad ass name haha. Hooded Menace fucking rip.
Classic.
Thought maybe some people would like this here. I saw these guys when I was in high school, pretty sure they never toured or really played outside of Oklahoma.
Also FFO: Noothgrush. One of my favourite sludge bands for sure!
These guys look like a fucking blast live.
There's something very 90s about this band that I enjoy. A sort of groovy catchiness that got stomped out with the backlash against nu-metal. I hear it in Babymetal too.
Paging /u/Raging_Elephant
Not tech death, but good stuff for sure.
It would be great if we did *Nothing But Doom December*.  Or maybe some kind of play on Season Affective Disorder.
Not trying to defend Bolzer here, I couldn't care less about them either way, but why eat up a prime top billing in a 'next week releases' post for a song/album/band you're only going to trash?

Even if they mean "Anticipated by other people" fuck it. Leave them off. Give that space to any one of 30 other releases coming out that will be more worth it.
The upcoming releases threads on here are way better.
"Bestial black metal is stale" then goes on to act like the new Bestial Raids is really anything more than another great slab of war metal. Now I remember why I stopped reading this site.
Really hope the new Root is a good return to form. Not gonna hit the early tracks because I'd rather hear the whole thing, though. 
Fucking hell Lita is one bad lady. 
Such a weak and overrated record. I'll take The Runaways over any of her solo work. 
That guitar solo.  This song got me into DT and more into prog metal in general.
This song gets so good at 3:50.
Ahhhh some good ol' DT. I can never decide, but this is definitely in my top few DT albums along with Awake, Images and Word, and Six Degrees. 

Although I like the Astonishing, it was pretty laughable when I saw DT fans asking "which is the better rock opera: Scenes or The Astonishing?" There is truly no competition. 
Anybody interested in the Indian scene, this is a good starting point. This, and Millennium.
Love it
This album is pretty killer, wasn't too impressed with Other Worlds though.
Love this tune. 
I always did like this name better.
That is the funniest name for a band I have heard in a long time. Pretty solid, though. Nice find. 
Excellent album. Hope to own it at some point.
Literally heading out right now to go see Napalm Death and TBDM.  Gonna be a killer show.
Super weird this is the one grind band I don't own anything from, but fuck man I hate those Earache prices, hahaha.
I've been watching them the last 4 years. They're coming to Vancouver for 4 years straight and I can tell you that is by far, one of the best bands to watch live.
I wanted to cover this song a few years back but it never happened. Absolutely a killer tune from my favourite ND release!
Saxon is easily one of the five most important bands in the formation of my taste in music. 

Wheels of Steel, Strong Arm of the Law, and Denim and Leather are all legendary albums and will always be dear to me.
Saw them in Manchester, UK a couple of weeks ago. They're awesome live.
I still think princess of the night has one of the best riffs in metal
Saxon is easily one of the best bands in the worlds. Always delivering and still making great music.
wow, lol.   0 net upvote for an album that sells for over $80 

There's a live version of this that I like where they're on a flat trailer playing in front of about 10 people. I always thought it was funny because I know there were a few people walking by wondering what the fuck all that noise is.
That opening still gives me chills. An amazing album.
Did these guys officially call it a day, or are they just on hiatus? Loved Mookie's columns in Decibel to.
I miss these guys so much.  Both of their albums are incredible experiences and I've still never found anything else quite like them
I totally forgot about this song. Thank you!

What is this? Only thing I found out is that Metal Archives doesn't consider them metal. Can someone tell me a bit about them?
Love this album
such a wonderful album, we need more of these guys

Oh man. Thanks for posting this. Been years since I listened to this album.  Going to give it a spin with my new headphones!
Scene kid bullshit for bird haired wimps.
To me this is the best comeback album ever.
I  haven't listened to Blood of Nations much, but Stalingrad is absolutely stunning. I'm in love with Hung, Drawn and Quartered. 
Great song + Wolf soloing on top of a tank = Me headbanging a lot.
Every time I listen to Accept I'm always reminded me of the hilarious Twitter exploitation that happened, where some guy tweeted "Accept pwns" and found out how to force people to follow you without approval. [Link](http://www.metalsucks.net/2010/05/11/did-accept-destroy-twitter/).
Udo Accept > Non-Udo Accept
Holy shit is this ever cheesy. 
And they are touring together with Sabaton! 🤘
[I am not disappointed, r/metal](http://i.imgur.com/bkhXGod.png)
So fucking good! Their last 3 albums have all kicked so much ass.
Another killer British band that was singing that 666 was the number of the beast in 1982. 
Man I really fucking miss these guys. This was one of the first four albums I bought on vinyl. And I haven't heard anything from any of the members since they broke up - are they not playing in other bands now?
Okay, this is great. Where do I begin my Mortem journey?
I actually kinda dug that.  That was some wild wammy bar abuse
Power?  I always thought of them as more prog.
The song that got me into this band. I'm so glad I got into them, absolutely love this album and especially Awaken The Guardian.
Absolutely fantastic band. Fans should be sure to check out Adramelch (It) and Gehenna (Mex)- both of them took heavy queues from Fates Warning when they were finding their own sounds.  
I have listened to Night on Brocken, Spectre Within, and Awaken the Guardian countless times over the last 30 years. I will never tire of John Arch fronted Fates.
Was so psyched to see them at progpower last year. Fantastic band. Fantastic album!
What's your budget? 
the /r/vinyl sidebar looks pretty helpful
You can get fully setup with a uturn orbit. It's a fully customizable table which allows for upgrades over time.

U turn Basic. Pluto PreAmp.

If you have active speakers ( you can plug them into wall) then you're good to go. 

 
I prefer DJ style turntables to audiophile turntables. Technics SL-1200 remains the gold standard for that sort of thing.
i have heard that you have to get a record player made out of solid steel and granite. the expensive ones are made out of tungsten and diamond, which is heavier.

interesting fact: speed metal turntables, interestingly, play everything at 45 rpm, regardless of the diameter.


Brats good. 
not bad
Wow, this is really cool, especially the ending.
A really cool album I jumped on a bit late sadly, their demo is killer too. 

If I have a gripe it's that I don't think the band's name is very good. I always think of Captain Caveman...I guess he could do some mean drumming with his club. 
I saw these guys reformed this year, are they making any new albums or just doing some live shows? 
Ive always loved this EP
I had never bothered to listen to these guys before despite hearing the name a million times.  Pretty decent.  I like the guitar player.  Combine this guitar player's wammy abuse with Van Halen licks and you get Trey Azagthoth.
Thanks for the recommendation, /u/spiner202 and /u/reddit_revised.
God I love this specific song of the entire album.
By random coincidence, I listened to this album today at work (I made my playlist a few days in advance, so it wasn't spurred on by the recent conversation about the album). Mr. Death is my favourite track, but this one obviously rules too.

This album was probably the hardest CD for me to find. I think I was looking for it for about 7 years before finally finding it.
Great album. I have yet to check out anything else they've put out. Been lagging it for years
I always wonder why these guys weren't/aren't more popular.  Great riffs, great solos, tolerable singing, good drumming, catchy hooks, punky energy....whats not to love?
Fans of this record and band should check out the new Death Fortress album from this year- great Hate Forest worship. 
I thought there was a moratorium on NSBM.

EDIT: I was referring to when the same guy posted like 20+ NSBM songs in one daym
Got this the other day, so good. 
Great band. 
Great band and album.
*Realm of Sacrifice* was one of my favorite releases last year. Everything from that group of guys is amazing.
Damn, I really like the vocal effect after 2:00.

Definitely dig the minimalist appearance they have going here. A lot of bands could learn from this.
I wonder what Polish tongue twisters are like
This album and the debut are both fantastic. Lovecraft just makes everything even better.
Hugest sound I've heard from a death metal band for a while. This whole album is fantastic.

Plus Lovecraft <3
Such a phenomenal album, one of my favourites from last year.
Skid Row rules
Fun fact, this was the first metal album to debut at #1 on Billboard.
I've always considered this album more pre-Pantera type groove metal. Never thought of it as "hair metal"
This and Monkey Business are both classics.  
>1991

Bloody hell, I thought this song was from '82 or something. 
This is an incredible record. Sebastian Bach's vocals absolutely kill.
This whole album is one of the very few albums that to this day, I can listen to over and over again and never get sick of.
My best friend at the time and I always sang, "You can't be king of the world with that big, fat behind!"
I'm ashamed to say this was my first time hearing skid row. That song was catchy as fuck. What are some other favorites you guys like a lot?
Skid Row/Pantera at the Meadowlands Summerfest in Jersey, summer 1992. I've been to hundreds of concerts, and that one was THE FUCKING SHIT. Hands down, best show of my life. Both bands killed it.
Having only heard 18 and Life, this song was sure a surprise...
So in 1991 I was hanging out with some people at a party & I rolled in with this tape. I put it on & they thought I had brought in some badass new metal band. When I told them who it was, they made me take the tape out. Later that night I got into a fight with some dude. I never hung out with that bunch again. Actually, I think that night changed my life.
This is one of the best songs from them, and as well the tune that makes a clear difference between hair rock/metal and heavy metal. I have to agree with Aekhampatient I would never consider them hair metal.
I interview Seb years ago and despite a few absurdities he is a great front man.
I will always upvote this song
Ive only ever heard the chorus to this song.  Pretty badass song.
At a Skid Row show, you'd be hearing people constantly shout 18 to Life...it's like they don't appreciate this song at all. It's a shame...
[deleted]
Loud and fast, just like daddy likes it.

The whole album is available in better quality at [Bandcamp](https://tribunalrecords.bandcamp.com/album/dystopia).
Great band. Iffy name 
Ok so this wasnt dissapointing at all but it put me off abit. In April, Megadeth, Anthrax and Overkill came to play "Thrash the island" festival where I live in Puerto Rico. Now keep in mind, metal bands NEVER come to puerto rico and seeing 2 out of the big 4 in one night was amazing! So Overkill and Anthrax play their set and everything is amazing. Megadeth then came on, starting with Hangar 18. Now the show is going perfect without a hitch until something strange happened. Dave got on the mic and announced that they were gonna play Peace Sells but heres the thing: THEY ALREADY PLAYED IT 4 SONGS AGO. So the concert goes silent and the drummer tells him something and he starts "Holy Wars". Now Holy Wars is my favorite song of all time and my dream was to see it played live. So the song starts but Dave started singing too late and caused the drummer (who wasnt Dirk or Chris) to get confused but they still played it off. When the "Punishment Due" riff starts, Dave stops mid-riff TO SCRATCH HIS EAR witch caused him to skip a note that pretty much ruined the moment. So Dave kinda fucked up Holy Wars but he played the solo PERFECTLY. Dont get me wrong, all three bands were amazing that night but seeing the song ive allways wanted to hear live getting fucked up kinda reassured the ol' "never meet your heroes" mindset. Still awesome show
Attitude Adjustment. They only played a handful of tracks off *American Paranoia* and when they did they played the meathead versions they recorded on *No Way Back*. Basically they became a tough guy hardcore band when they reformed. I should have figured when people were more excited for freaking *Spazztic Blurr* than they were for AA. The crowd went from fairly packed to only a handful of guys at the front of the stage.  
When I saw Incantation, McEntee was out (believe his wife had a medical issue), and the replacement vocalist wasn't very good. On top of that, the sound in that little tiny room they played in sucked, so it was an all-around bummer. Seeing them again next month which will hopefully make up for it. 
Butcher Babies was the worst thing I've ever seen on a stage.
Ozzfest was terrible this year, at least in the sense that i was dehydrated, tired, had a horrible migraine, and beat up. Missed Sabbath because I left during Megadeth, but I just could not hang any more. That dust, heat, and lack of water fucking killed me.

I saw JFAC open for GWAR once, that was pretty terrible. 

Worst ever is probably the Nuge though. Ted spends half the show shit talking Obama. I don't really care for him either, but fuck man attacking him on conspiracy theory bullshit (He's a muslim, he wasn't even born in this country, he's a communist, he hates americans, fuck gay marriage, fuck abortion, etc etc etc.) is just fucking tiring. JUST PLAY STRANGLE HOLD AND SHUT THE FUCK UP TED. 
Saw all that remains and slayer at a metal fest in Tampa a few years ago and was totally disappointed with both of them, All That Remains vocalist was terrible, he kept holding the mic to the crowd because he couldn't do the vocals and the band's timing was way off, fucking horrible. Slayer sounded like total shit, guitars out of tune and cutting out and the drummer sounded like he was going half speed. Thankfully The Black Dahlia Murder, God Forbid and Job for a Cowboy made it more than worth the money. Still a disappointment. 
Don't know if it's metal enough for this sub but I went to see Killing Joke a couple of weeks ago and it was pretty hit or miss.

I'm a fan of their earlier post-punk stuff and their more recent heavier stuff. The early stuff sounded  fantastic and were definitely the high points of the gig but the later heavier stuff didn't really translate live. They just couldn't capture the aggression or heaviness of the albums.
Whenever I see stam1na, they don't really have the aggression their music deserves, and the singer is usually off key, lost his voice, or just sounds a lot worse. Meh.

EDIT: I also saw some hardcore metalcore, idk, gig and it was so good that I just got drunk and tried not to fall asleep. I stared at the lights and bopped my head with my eyes going open and shut. Can't say I remember anything about the music, but it must have been really good to almost lull me into sleep in a bar.
In Flames in Manchester, UK on the A Sense of Purpose tour, and they only played 1 song pre-Clayman (Episode 666 I think which was great).

I guess they put on a good performance but by deciding to focus predominantly on the latest album (not even much from Come Clarity which was only the album before) they clearly dissapointed a lot of the fans there.

Tldr:  Modern-day In Flames being modern-day In Flames.
I haven't had a shitty/disappointing concert yet (I have my doubts about Guns N Roses next year though) but I've seen some pretty bad opening acts. Shihad opening for AC/DC sucked ass, but maybe that's just because I hate Shihad. Lamb of God had some local band on before them whose name I have forgotten and the sound mixing was bad, the guitarist was shit, and the singer kept telling us to open up a circle pit when the crowd was barely even moshing. 
Gojira. "Please don't try to come up on stage, if you kick the mic, its hurts my teeth, and we all go home" 

French people...
Isis. One of my favourite bands of all time and their show in Sydney bored me so much I didn't listen to them again for years.
Just saw them in Milwaukee this week. Pretty good for a free show.
My favourite song of the new album. So bloody good
No upvotes for this? What a travesty.
Phenomenal album. Really want one of the early (ie, original master) pressings. 
what.the.fuck. 

I think Ultimate Incantation is a bit overrated but Sothis and de Profundis is criminally underrated.

One of my fave Vader songs, good choice.
That beefy bass drum is just lovely.
It's really a shame that they never topped their utterly fantastic demos. Their albums are all solid, but it's just not the same. 
Interesting how his vibrato intensifies, but his voice is a lot lower live, than on record. Kind of wish he would perhaps go just a bit lower and add a little more energy, so it would have had more balls. 
Wonder when we'll be getting a new Unisonic album.
Fuck I hope my band can finish writing enough shit to gig soon. Come April we're dead anyway cause our main songwriter and my best friend is moving cross-country.

I say that because we're covering this track. If I can finish the lyrics and he can finish the leads for our other original songs.
Really hope I have can afford one of the 3LP reissues of this or the EP before they sell out. 
One of the all-time greatest records. Atlantean Kodex have also done a great [cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15vCSfm38Vk) of this song.
Love the vaguely dick shaped cloud on the left. Great band.
This is the catchiest goddamn song. 
Hey cool. I didn't know a band wrote a song about my penis.
That song title almost makes then seen self aware.
I really enjoyed this song. Lamb of God is one of the 'entry level' bands that I still really enjoy.
Not my style of vocals bit the sound production was nice and tight and the energy was great. Bonus points for being able to hear the bass in the mix as well. 
Totally just rediscovered these guys. Forgot all about them. They opened for FFDP back in the day. Great band.
lmao @ 00:59  "look guys I can helicopter my hair too!"
I've never met a metalhead who didn't like this song when I showed it to them. Great band, great song
Motor City Thrash. Great band, even greater dudes. 
Wow, great song! I'm psyched to check out their album (s). Thanks OP!
These guys are incredibly badass musicians and super nice guys, luckily they come to a small venue near me every year on their winter warriors tour. War of Will is easily one of my favorite modern metal records.
Great live...seen them with suffocation and soulfly...i was more excited about battlecross more than anything. Sick as fuck.

Cutting out the intro is sacrilege, the drum work in it is awesome. 
Classic stuff. Sodom are amazing!
Because you can't have NBBMN without Bestial Mockery.           
      
&nbsp;      
    
>**WARFUCK - FUCKED WITH A HELLHORN!**
only chainsaw metal ist real 
These guys never get enough respect.
Picked up some Bestial Mockery on a whim earlier this year because it was super cheap in a DDR sale, and I unwittingly had the false burned and died right out of me.
DON'T CALL ME YOUR BROTHER

I AIN'T YOUR FUCKING BROTHER

WE FELL FROM DIFFERENT CUNTS

AND YOUR SKIN'S AN UGLY COLOR
I feel like this guy in the Youtube comments managed to break down the message of the song perfectly:

> I think this song is literally half joke, half serious. The first half being joke, describing generic, grotesque race war situation, while at the same same time dismissing violence as a solution ("no one wins we all lose").

> The second part of the song is where it gets slightly more serious. It doesn't seem so intentionally over-the-top or absurd, as Carnivore's lyrics often are. This is where he recognizes that there simple are certain characteristics in man-kind, from the very beginning ( Cain and Able set the course) that we will never be able to get over with and we should just rather face the fact and find other solutions instead of forced multiculturalism.

>  "Xenophobic tendencies
> instilled in us at birth
> are misabled racism
> hostilities getting worse
> accept the fact my distant cousin
> we cannot live in peace
> isolated environments
> may just be the key"

> So, the lesson of the song is that race hate will take us nowhere but neither will imaginary la-la lands where racial differences don't exist. I kinda like how Carnivore is able to find to make kinda smart analysis through such very provoking song.﻿
> Show less
A.M.A. I met Peter Steele 
Great record. Cheers Peter.
[All I can think of when I hear this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYy77IGsBFc)

[Hey Bill! Race War!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYy77IGsBFc)
it's so cute when people discover this band for the first time
I got to a fairly small university and in my World Religions course we were discussing Buddhism and he told us about some Tibetan Buddhists coming to campus for a bit and I mentioned how this album had strong ties to Buddhism and was centralized on Tibet and he was interested and said he'd check it out. He came up to me after the next class and told me "the sounds I heard weren't really sounds I like to hear" haha. He's a solid dude and the facial expression he had when he said that just really got me. I warned him beforehand though but still pretty cool that a 65 yr old philosophy professor would check out a death metal album simply because of the theme. Mad respect to him. 
Amazing band and HIGHLY recommended. 
Going through Rare and Obscure Metal Archives ?
Wow that Kreator video really didn't leave much out. Boobs, violence, blood and satan. 
That Ultha album is so great!
These posts are terrific, mate, I look forward to them every week.

Edit: That new Raspail was goddamn perfect on a gloomy day to be filled with raking.
Holy Shit! That Kreator track just flat crushes it! Completely on board with wanting to hear more.
Do you write for a website by chance? These posts are awesome.
Thanks for putting so much effort into this thread! 
New Superjoint makes me happy.
Raspail was a nice surprise. Never heard of this dudes before, but from what I've heard so far, it sounds really good.
>Vhöl's Aesop Dekker on drums  
  
Curious, but why did you pick Vhol instead of Agalloch as a descriptor?
I feel like I should enjoy the new Antaeus album more than I actually do. On a cursory listen, very little stood out to me. I often had trouble telling one song apart from the other. Perhaps I need to listen more attentively, but on my first listen I didn't hear anything that made me want to listen to it again.

That new Kreator song is pretty fucking sick though. Super consistent band. Puts Metallica to shame, frankly.
Fuck yes, more shit from Iron Reagan.

Ultha is not completely anti-metallica, since at least they ripped off the song lengths. And the intro is just like on a Metallica album (too long and stupid). Other than that, the similarities pretty much end there. It's actually good, interesting and challenging music. 

Always read this posts! Thanks for all men, great redaction, comparison, and new bands to listen. 

Raspail album are great, if the band do a limited press of it in vinyl, I'm going to buy it for sure. 
> listen to the new Behold... The Arctopus record, full of uncalled for Colin Marston-isms

You got some writing chops, I'm amazed at how you're able to say so much in literally half a sentence there.
Awesome post , I will definitely be checking back weekly! Thanks.
New [Quicksand Dream](https://quicksanddream.bandcamp.com/album/beheading-tyrants) is amazing, and you missed that. Everyone into trad should check it. 
I absolutely love this band. This is one (1) of my all-time favourite black metal EPs.
Good question. This band (and track) is awesome. 
Why the downvotes? Apologies in advance, I'm a newbie at this
Just saw them last night. Would've been great if the sound guy knew what he was doing, could barley hear any lead guitar
I still LOL @ how awesome the album cover is. 

I've heard this band being talked about a few times on here and this was my first listen. 

I'm a bit conflicted. I like the guitar work and overall feel but the drumming is just a put off for me, it has that really clicky modern black metal drum tone I'm not a fan of. 

It was nice though, just wish the drums had a bit more oomph to them. 
If you can get past the Christian lyrics, this is a really fantastic album in my opinion. Great riffs, and the way they use synths and atmospheric effects is quite subtle and tasteful. Works really well.
Fucking amazing band. One of the best right now.  I want another LP. 
Definetly need to check this album out and their others too.
Hell yeah, I crowdfunded this. Awesome EP.
I feel the vocals are more refined on their newer releases, but the sound of the instruments, the power of riffs are there. It still kicks ass, and I have to say instrumentally it's impressive.
As brilliant as they are musically, it's a shame they went with this stupid 'modern' cover art trend with their season of mist releases/reissues. 


Cautiously optimistic. Agalloch was great because the members of that band balanced out each others' strengths and weaknesses. 
Text from facebook post:

"The recording process for Pillorian’s debut album has been completed. Engineering took place throughout October and November at Witch Ape Studio/Skyway Audio by Tad Doyle (Brothers of the Sonic Cloth, TAD) and Stephen Parker at Sprout City Studios in Eugene, OR.
The album will be mixed and mastered in Germany at Klangschmiede Studio E by Markus Stock (Empyrium, The Vision Bleak, etc) in early/mid-December.
It is scheduled to be released via Eisenwald to coincide with our European tour."

Sounds like a Spring release.
Amazing band, but wouldn't really call their early stuff especially "extreme metal." It's just weird hardcore. 
\m/
I had forgotten about this band. 

Proof that sometimes a band can collapse into its own self-aggrandizing.   Possibly the biggest disappointment of all bands from the 90s Norse scene.

Man, I fuckin' love Kreator.
The chorus is almost identical to United in Hate.

*We! Shall! Kill!* versus *We! Are! Legions!* with a very similar melody underneath.

I still like the song, but did they really not notice that?
Sounds great, another good Kreator song with a continuation of the Phantom Antichrist sound is good with me
I am none of those that see Phantom Antichrist as such a perfect album as many seem to do, but I love it, got to say this is about on the same level, maybe slightly under it but I am certainly very excited for the album.
Honestly, I thought this was a weak effort by Kreator.
NoEvDia is the official YouTube account for this release*
This new album just doesn't do it for me. Maybe it's the production or possibly just the drumming, but every song feels the exact same. Wasn't just the first time listeners vibe either, I gave it a few spins.
Totally classic band. Fans should also check out Tales of Medusa, who are named after a song from this EP. 
One of the best albums ever recorded.
more people should listen to this, Krabathor, etc  
I have this album on tape because /u/bigdon8 is a nice guy and threw it in for free with an order I made from him. Also have one of their 7"s lying around here somewhere. 
Great folk record(s) and killer dudes. Ate burritos and stood in 20 degree weather talking with them for a few hours. Awesome dudes. 
This whole album is great! Although I prefer the Swedish versions, as I am from Sweden.

At first I thought this was one of the weaker tracks included on the Satan's Addiction and Pure Madness compilation but now I've got over the synth and piano sections that initially drew me in, this one of the best tracks on the earlier half of it. Excellent parts in it just like with the last part of the next track included, Shadow Thorns.
Years of drinking brought liver problems on so many guys from the Metal community.
Damn that sucks. Wish him the best. 
Everybody was talking shit about him falling off the wagon when they had to cancel their dates awhile back. I hope they feel stupid now.     
Mike helped bring the gift of sludge to us. Pulling for him to get better.
Idk if I kept crashing my car into shit and being a shit driver I wouldn't expect anyone to donate money for repairs or anything of that nature. that being said I love EHG, Take As Needed For Pain is one of my favorite albums, and I hope for the best for Mike. 
Absolutely love early Theatre of Tragedy, especially "Aegis" which is a real staple of gothic metal. It's too bad (for my taste) that the band went in the direction they went after their first three albums.
He's one of my favourite people in metal. Big fan of him and his music.
Wow I never would thought people would think humanure was the more offensive art work.
I'm surprised he didn't mention himself being on the cover of To Serve Man wearing full makeup and prosthetics.
I always assumed Monolith was a reference to 2001: A space odyssey. I'm surprised he didn't mention it. 
I love this guy. 
man that is some deep shit 
Love Creamface but holy shit aside from their latest material it's incredibly expensive to get the CDs.
Dat fucking lineup. I'll definitely check this out. 

edit: this is cool
Alabama represent. Love this band 
As an era: right around 1992 or 1993. As a sonic profile for death metal: never, there's still stuff being made in that vein, and there was through the entire '90s and '00s. 
Top five albums on Rate Your Music in "death metal," subgenre inclusive.

**1992**
***
**05** Legion  
**04** Last One on Earth  
**03** Slumber of Sullen Eyes  
**02** The IVth Crusade  
**01** Onward to Golgotha

**1993**
***
**05** Nespithe  
**04** Heartwork  
**03** Covenant  
**02** Focus  
**01** Individual Thought Pattersn

Seems pretty cut and dry to me.
I'd consider old-school death metal to be anything prior to 1995, though the style peaked in between 1992-1993. 
Maybe '96 or so? It's hard to say. It's sort of like how thrash took a nosedive after 1991, but there were still a few stragglers after that. Most of the great OSDM was '94 or earlier, but there are some albums that came out after that seem appropriate to fit in with OSDM.
Mayhem with Chimera album
I liked this EP a lot, one of the best releases from earlier in the year. 
The whole album, called Sorg, can be found in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9gGubCkZug&list=PLOUX4RoasdJzmI6_Ny2yFt0-3k6yOtirK) playlist.
After listening to this artist a fair bit over the past year I've got to say this track although surrounded by lots of great tracks it's truly stand out. I'm willing to say now that it's one of my favourite tracks of all time.

The moment at 5:20 when the beat picks up again after the long, sorrowful, trudging along of everything that comes before is just perfect. It feels powerful just before it happens and so satisfying once it does.
ahhh, one of the bands ushered in on  Solistitium's imprints.   Back when NSBM was being rebranded under the catchall of 'paganism'. 

Memories....

>You got a 33 minute song talking about a library... and... it works. So why not y'know. You don't have to kill people to be brutal.

I fucking love Luc. 
I was just waiting for Luc to namedrop DsO. Dude just can't hide his fanboyism.

He seems like a super chill and humble guy. I'd love to hang out with him.

Edit: that bit at the end about how we don't need a million bands playing like Suffocation is so true, and valid for *so* many other bands.
Legend. One of the thrills of my life was seeing this man live.
Dude is super-cool, sounds like a fucking demon in his music, super nice and smart in person. Saw them in Oct, great show 10/10.
Luc rules. Chaining the Katechon is so fucking good. I feel like the new Deathspell Omega record is also more or less a cohesive ~30 minute song as well, despite officially having four tracks.
I really need to give their albums after Erosion a proper listen. Considered Dead is what I consider Gorguts, but damn, it's really not.  
Luc really seems like a cool dude.  
He looks like a brownish J Mascis. 
Luc Lemay is one of my favorite metal musicians. Not only does he seem like a super chill guy, but I think he has been trained to compose classical pieces as well (Battle of Chamdo)

 I had the chance to see Gorguts live and it was one of the few bands that produces nearly the same quality that you would get on their record. I have to admit that I am a little bit of a fan boy and freaked out at the opportunity to meet him. I'm such a pussy.
He's always seemed really grounded and willing to be open with his ideas to better the community.   See those old videos he did with Guitar   on how they wrote/played stuff like Inverted.

33 minutes? Amateur.
Good old Rare & Obscure Metal Archives.
>Buried and Forgotten  

Apt title lol. Great song tho.
[Guess people don't like band camp links](https://blackmetalwaldgefluester.bandcamp.com/track/graustufen-novembertage), I just [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/5dn3ib/waldgefl%C3%BCster_graustufen_novembertage_black_metal/) this a few hours ago
Hadn't really listened to any of their stuff outside of the split with Panopticon, but this is great.
This really is a highly opinionated topic, so you're gonna get something different from everyone. For me personally, I'm quite a calm guy who rarely gets angry at anything. Because of that, I don't listen to music to let off steam at all. I just enjoy it. Never really had the "this song makes me wanna punch somebody" feeling. 

Mostly, highly aggressive music makes me motivated to do stuff. I almost always listen to Death Metal while working out for example.

I do listen to different kinds of metal in different moods of course. When it's cold, Black fits the atmosphere best in my opinion, and when I'm tired in the evening after work, I can't listen to any brutal stuff and often put on some Iron Maiden or the like. 
I started listening to metal because I liked the music and well, I'm still here because I like the music. But sure, sometimes it helps getting rid of anger and frustration and such feelings.
> it's more like a punching bag than an aural experience. 

This outlook is a symptom of naming *metal* the umbrella covering [this](https://youtu.be/7QcMhOFAVzE) and [this](https://youtu.be/YaspJ-4p3xY).

For some of us, this isn't a hobby.
there was a best of comment a few weeks ago explaining the value of death metal. 

https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/595xi6/til_jessica_pimentel_from_orange_is_the_new_black/d96em7c/?context=3

Again, it talked about the primal nature of the music and the emotional catharsis of the music. While it is perfectly okay to experience music in whatever way you choose, I feel this comment got best of because people who don't listen to to death metal WANT to believe that it is this simple. It reinfoceds the steretype of the lunkhead stoner in the Megadeth shirt that just wants to rage. It doesn't take into account the enjoyment for ravenous death or death with high occult themes. There is no mention of riffs or the variety of themes found in heavy metal. I believe people want it to be simple since it does look complex from the outside and thus there is a tendency by others to support conclusions that fit their own narrative. 

 Listening to this like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZvM2iTg-GM) doesn't have any specks of catharsis rather just geeky enjoyment for the riffs and lyrical matter.  
The primal anger outlet side of metal never really appealed to me. There's a lot of styles of metal that focus on it, and others that dont. The style they choose as an outlet doesn't really matter, everyone listens to music for different reasons
There's definitely some catharsis chucking on a Deicide album, especially when I grew up in a Christian household. That was always a good way to release some energy while playing videogames.

Now, I think I've kinda shifted gear. I'm pretty picky with what metal I like now which feels pretty restrictive. I definitely love bands like Septicflesh for a lot more than just the cathartic experience of listening to them. Any metal bands with religious content like Behemoth, Batushka, Schammasch, etc. just fit my interests so I can listen to them in pretty much any mood.

Dealing with depressing and anxiety and all that fun shit, metal can really help sometimes with that. But then so can a lot of hip-hop, so I think it's just a thing music does in general.

Black metal bands do tend to energise me but I wouldn't say that's an aggressive thing. I think that's just what good fucking music does.

Then there's stuff like Atheist, particularly on Elements, where they just produced excellent music. I don't think anyone could really associate that with aggression.

EDIT: I hope all this has made sense because I've had quite a lot of vodka. \m/
> i see huge swathes of people talk about how they only got into metal because of their own personal anger and frustration and the music relieves that in a sense, and now they've "out-grown" it

No one goes, 'Yeah I was really into Slayer one summer.' I've never met that guy. I've only met the guy that's got 'Slayer' carved across his chest.
Metal for me was never an outlet for darker feelings and emotions like you describe. My outlet for such painful things like that took the form of classical music, and scores and soundtracks to any other movie or game that shared similar emotional content. Final Fantasy games and the Lord of the Rings films for example were my emotional items.

When it came to metal, I simply admired the technical skill, energy, speed, power, and all that other such stuff that goes into. All of my classically influenced thinking would pick apart guitar arrangements and how metal subverted a lot of musical rules. 

For example the presence of a second guitar changes the dynamic of established rock structure. The percussion is of course handled by the drums, bringing volume and crescendo. The rhythmic aspects are carried by the drums and the bass together. The bass and secondary guitar manage to form the chord progressions and basic structure. The lead melodic elements then are handled by the primary guitar. This allows the vocal content to be atmospheric, and lend a new element to the music behind it. It's not restricted to carrying melody.

Then I discovered prog-metal and classically styled metal and it blew me away. The Human Abstract's "Digital Veil" album is some of the most complex and incredible guitar work I've ever heard. Between the Buried and Me is my favorite metal group because of how much musical talent that band has, jumping genre and convention every other verse, and is a perfect example of how beautiful and diverse metal can be.
I like metal for the skilled instrumentation. I honestly think lyrics limit the possibilities with metal, especially fusion and prog metal.
I don't think I've ever been in it for much more than the music, to be honest. It's simply the only genre that's ever really resonated with me. I never listened to a lot of music growing up, it wasn't until I slowly got into metal in my late teens that I was listening to things regularly. I just enjoyed the technicality of the music. Plus there's just something genuine to the music, to me.

I know this applies to plenty of genres, but because Metal isn't fashionable I get the feelling that most bands know they're not likely to become superstars and are playing the music that they play primarily because it's their passion, and that comes through in the music.

There are times where I'll stick something more prog or soft on when I'm looking to feel a little more chilled, but it stops there really. But it's never been an outlet for angst, anger or anthing like that. I think that's what surprises my friends, in their words I don't look like a "metal person" at all and they find it odd that I can stick on "angry music" for a car trip, train ride or just background music. I just like Metal because It's fun to listen to, whether it's some silly tech death or getting lost in some doom. I recognise the emotion in the music, but it doesn't make me feel that way myself.

Thinking about it, I think the most effect it has on me is that it happens to make excellent "pump up" music, particularly the more upbeat melodeath stuff like Bodom. Always stick some on while I warm up for a match.
Bullshit. Art in general comes down to people expressing themselves; metal is not anything special in that regard. All of the \m/ proud to be a metalhead \m/ stuff makes me sick.

I'm a diehard metal fan and it means incredibly much to me emotionally, but so does music from other genres. Claiming that metal is this untouchable thing is immature and narrow minded.

If being a metalhead means being ignorant about any other art forms I don't want to be one. And that's coming from your stereotypical long haired leather jacket kind of guy.
If someone says they are just into metal to let their anger out they are a poseur.
People who just god mad as a teenager and heard a Metallica song at the same time on the radio while they were breaking stuff are a vocal minority. 

I live in a small town where there are probably only like 5 metal dudes and they have "been metal" pretty much their entire lives, or at least as far as I've known them. We have no "scene" or community, there's just one guy who works at a liquor store and owns a leather jacket, and I'll go there to buy a beer and he'll say, "Hey, nice Slayer shirt", and I'll say, "Thanks, are you listening to King Diamond? Awesome". Yet we all remain fans of Metal for our own individual reasons.

As a counterpoint, I once worked as a dishwasher in the county seat with this guy from a small town on the other side of the county, who was pretty into Djent and other 'core genres. We got along because I enjoy Deathcore in addition to other forms of Metal, but I distinctly remember when I asked him, "Why do so many people from your town like Metal", his immediate response was, "I don't know, it's a shitty town and people are pissed off".

The guys in my town who are into metal each have their own genre...there's a depressed Black Metal guy, a drunk Thrash Metal guy, a pagan Folk Metal guy. For me, I enjoy it because of the complexity and the sincerity. I also enjoy classical music because of its complexity and symphonic characteristics, something which I feel is certainly paralleled by Metal with its frequent use of multiple guitars and complex melodies.

I think the problem is that what you're asking here is, "Does a Metal fan fit a particular archetype", when what you should truly be asking is, "Do different genres of Metal appeal do different archetypes of people"?

That being said, even though I love Deathcore and I think it's sad that 'core in general gets a bad rap, there was definitely a subculture of "Metalcore fans" in my area for about a decade (when it was trendy to be a "Scene Kid" moron). However, those same people are all now just following the newest trend which they believe makes them alternative to the norm, blinded from the realization that they're merely paralleling normalcy with their spoon-fed sub-cultural customs. So yeah, there were definitely a lot of douchebags into Metalcore, but they would have been into fucking Polka if MTV told them it was edgy and anti-authoritarian.
Por que no los dos?
I am into metal for the same reason I buy anything: the quality and quantity of dragons on the cover.
For me, it's always been about emotion and good songwriting. This can apply to any genre of music, but metal has that extra bit of aural aesthetic that just gets it right for me. 

I've never thought that flashy musicianship and highly advanced skills were solely necessary for good metal - it's probably why I love doom so much. Often, a simple minor chord progression can evoke a lot more feeling than a guitarist noodling away at the phyrgian scale - *but it doesn't mean the opposite is not true*. 

I listen to a decent variety of music, which the above sentiment can also be applied to. If I listened to music solely for its musicianship, I'd be a bored man. Besides, anger isn't the only emotion that metal feeds. I'm just as pleased listening to something like Carpathian Forest if I'm seething with anger or if I'm blissfully elated.
It's for both definitely, for the good music itself and for the feeling it brings. And people are into metal because they like it for similar reasons.

There are so many kinds of metalheads so people can't really be put into solid groups. We as a community shouldn't categorize metal fans as being opposite groups to each other. And I wouldn't like the rest of the world treating us like we are some kind of a direct opposite for everything else. I like to think all of us being equal in that sense that we think we belong to a community and we treat each other with respect despite almost never agreeing on the topic of music itself. We inside this bubble of metal community generally argue about things and not against the person directly. That keeps the discussion classy and to the outside world we look united in our thing.
I bet most of us have started from something considered as mainstream before getting deeper and deeper into the music and all the various genres there are. That's why metalheads shouldn't dismiss the great effect of mainstream metal (I could point out Disturbed being one of those gateway bands for my generation). It brings people to the music after all. Also, new bands want to differentiate themselves from the group so there are interesting new and creative bands to be found continiously. 

The feelings are indeed important. I consider myself as a calm person, like many others do. Metal definitely helps that, helps keeping the calm additude. Lately, though, I've found out that the more depressing stuff (deathcore, black metal) doesn't help keeping bad feelings away. Maybe I've grown a bit from the worst teenage years when I faced some hardships in life. Now when things are better for me personally, I enjoy more of the technical and athmospheric aspects of metal. I'm still a big fan of a variety of genres. I enjoy new black metal, technical death metal and somewhat softer and complex industrial metal equally as well as metalcore and some of the more proggressive stuff. Of course I've had to "dig deep", listen to a lot of the older stuff to understand the cornerstone bands of every genre. But new music really keeps things fresh, I enjoy discovering bands by reading online music sites and scrolling through Spotify.

One thing I don't understand is the really vocal so called elitists. I don't want to call them minority or majority, they are equal fans of music still. But the negativity towards bands who don't stay the same is somewhat bothering. I as a person want to go forward, not stagnate. My interests grow with me and I keep understanding new things every day. It's natural that bands and artists who do their thing out of their passion for music progress and change. Change is inevitable. The general negativity and the expectations of bands not changing their original sound is something that should be dismissed as a direct insult to true passion and artistic creativity. Many of my favourite bands have changed during the years. I don't have to like them anymore but at the same time I don't have to hate them for doing what they want to do. After all, shouldn't metal be all about not giving a fuck what others expect you to be, and vice versa, you yourself can live your own life not having to comform to others expectations. 
> Do you think it's generally the case that people are really only into Metal for the "scene" aspect or just the "head-banging", or is that just the vocal minority?

These are definitely the ones that stand out. The corporate guy with his hair slicked back? You don't imagine him listening to Deicide. But those kinds of 'invisible' metalheads are probably more numerous than the ones with goatees, long hair, and leather jackets.

For me personally, metal is really about both the music *and* the feeling. I used to listen to a whole variety of metal, probably because we like to fit in a group when younger, but these past few years I've become very picky. I don't restrict myself to a single genre. There's music that I like and music that I don't like. But there will always be that one itch that no kind of music but metal can scratch.
I'm definitely a mix of both. I love sitting down with my eyes shut and listening to what's going on, looking for all the clever little licks, tempo changes, drum fills and general musicianship that goes into a solid metal track. 

However, if I've had a shit day or some bad news, I turn that shit up to 10 and it's unbelievably cathartic. Metal can make me feel stuff no other genre can, and I love it for that too. 
I started listening to metal because I wanted to listen to something "heavy". It wasn't because I was angry and depressed (though I was angry and depressed). Today I listen to metal because I like it. I do like how angry and "violent" it can be, and sometimes I listen to it because I want to listen to something more aggressive. But sometimes I listen to certain classical composers because I want aggressive music as well.

But metal can also be beautiful, I find.

I don't think I'll ever outgrow metal, or stop listening to it if I'm dealing with my depression better.
I think the technical ability that metal demands for both instruments and vocals is what attracts a lot people. I know that musically the guitar playing in metal is some of the best that there is.
I started listening to metal at a very young age (thanks mom and dad) and I still do because not only do I enjoy the music -- I also enjoy the talent behind the music.  My early years were defined by Rush and Megadeth.

Then, around my sophomore year of high school, I was introduced to a band called Agalloch, and it completely flipped my musical experience upside down.  From then on, I was (and still am) always searching for bands that could incite emotion the way Agalloch could. 
I think words always fall short when trying to explain stuff like this, but I'll try.

Metal for me is beauty, power and pleasure. Even when it's ugly, it still moves me. It gives me energy. I'm not sure if I get catharsis or not, but what I know is that it can certainly resonate with bad or negative feelings, so the lyrical subjects are no coincidence. And when I'm having issues feeling pleasure, metal gives me that.
That "feeling" when listening to metal is Satan. I listen to metal to feel Satan permeate from my core. 
Personally I'm into metal for the music, the message it conveys (political for example) and it's all I have ever listened to.

My view is this: 

Why would anyone want to go to a r&b concert, or a pop concert. At these concerts the music comes from a computer, not talented musicians playing an instrument. If I got to a metal show, you see the guitarists shredding, you see the drummer playing his heart out and you see the vocalist putting all his emotion into the lyrics.

Metal is all about talent and it is something I appreciate and the messages they tend to convey are ones I agree with (in some way)

Example:

Why would I pay to see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFPUqXrztS8), when I could pay to see [this](https://youtu.be/6h9cSnsasyw?t=1m10s) 
I find when I listen to metal it is a mix of the two together. I find when I am in a mood or certain headspace for a certain style of metal it makes me appreciate the musical talent they have as well as accentuating the feeling the comes from the music. 

There are so many kinds of metal that I find there is a genre for every situation; going skiing? Stoner metal, long drive in the dark? Black metal, getting drunk? Thrash metal. The list goes on and on. 
Back when I started listening to metal, it was mostly about finding my place in the world. It's not anger. It's just smth.. missing? Metal gave me some pointers that it's ok and many people feel this way. That the world is much deeper than it looks. That got me into history and philosophy.

Personally I don't think metal is about anger. Is it angry-sounding? Yes. But IMO metal-anger is sort of tongue-in-cheek anger. That it's ok to be angry. It's ok to not fit in. It's ok to not follow the suite and don't match feels of people around you. Personally I think people who say metal is about anger just don't get what it really is. Yes, some late modes of metal may have no layer beyond that. But all the legendary stuff... DIO is anger? Iron Maiden is anger? Blind Guardian is anger? Come on... Even most thrash bands have much more going on.

Currently I listen to metal for several reasons. Yes, I appreciate skills and the sound itself. I got many memories associated with specific bands and songs too. And whenever I need to contemplate about outside world. But I don't necessarily have to be angry to listen to metal.  In fact, when I'm angry, I frequently listen to different music.
I started listening to metal exclusively because I liked the music.

I didn't even know that a huge scene of "headbangers" existed back then. Think late 90s/early 00s, I was about 18-20 years old at the time.

When I realized what a huge scene of dedicated fans hid behind the genre, I liked it even more... And I liked the looks, too. So I grew my hair long and started wearing camo-pants, band-shirts and the like, and I still love it today :D

Same for the music, still love it.

For me, the aspect of relieving stress through metal is not really that important.

Well, to put it differently, it *is* an important aspect, but I've used other music genres for that purpose in the past, so for me it is not specifically related to metal.

What is great about metal though is the huge amount of sub-genres, that are completely different and can fill many different roles for me.

For example, when I feel stressed and want to relax, I mostly listen to death metal... When I'm down I listen to power metal to cheer me up...

Some friends of mine who are into the scene think similarly. Of course I can't really know that for sure, but at least I don't know many people who "out-grew" their metal...
Depends greatly on the mood I'm in when I listen. Sometimes I put on some SYL for the machine gun guitars and drums because I want to get my frustration out, sometimes I'll put on some DT for the technicality of it, and sometimes it'll be Maiden for the lyrics, the moods, the feeling of an epic cavalcade. 

That's the beauty of the genre, just like Classical or Jazz, it is so varied and wide that you are bound to find something to your taste.
There is a cartoon or superhero type of thing to metal. That, combined with the abundance of teenage anger/angst-type lyrical content, causes a lot of people to "grow out of" the genre.

IMO, they never were too deep into the genre to begin with. They're correct in their opinion, but only about those specific bands. The genre is so massive that there's far more to it than that. Some bands are political, some address social issues or environmental concerns, spirituality, self confidence, etc. It's not all rage and anger and Dungeons & Dragons fantasy. Or sex.

I listen for the skill of the musicians as instrumentalists, vocalists, and songwriters. I listen for the emotions their music makes me feel. Sometimes for when I need a positive adjustment to my attitude, or sometimes when I want to get an adrenaline rush from that favorite riff. And sometimes I can't deal with metal and need the Beatles or Imogen Heap for a couple of weeks.
I think there's a good mix of people who enjoy the scene, the musicality, and a combination of both. Coming from a classical/jazz background, I find playing metal is challenging, and there's just a different energy you can take from it. 

The fellowship in the metal scene is rivaled by none, and I think a lot of people undervalue the social aspect of our music. Plus, everyone knows the dance!
I started to listen metal because a friend of mine showed me the way. I could never stand the grunting and shouting, thought the drummers were only banging as hard and as fast as they could. I thought it was music for people who indeed seek this genre as an outlet for hate, lonelyness etc. After my friend showed me that this was not the case I gave it a try and boy was i wrong. I never knew there were so many genres within metal itself. For me, I listen it for both reasons now I think. Sometimes I put on a heavy songs with the reep st and darkest lyrics and grunts, just to get some stress or irritation out. Other times i listen to it because I just love the music. But one thing is certain, I ALWAYS listen it because the rithme, use of Instruments, variation in style and many more things just amaze me as music itself. I like to refer a lot to the connection between classical music and metal, gives me the same feeling.
I think for me, the main appeal of metal is that it just sounds 'big.' There's a 'larger than life' aspect to it that you just can't get out of a typical indie rock song for example (nothing against indie rock, it's just going for something different, and furthermore, there is lots of good stuff in the genre). Metal is often more complicated, ambitious, dynamic, and just generally gives a different experience compared to any other genre (incidentally, I enjoy post rock bands like Swans or Godspeed You! Black Emperor for similar reasons). Being loud and violent is more secondary to me .

That's not taking away from the fact that there's appeal in something more raw and in your face. Though even the stuff I'd listen to that is more in that category, such as SYL or Dillinger Escape Plan still have the same sort of characteristics (big, complicated, ambitious, dynamic).
(18 yo, Brazil. Thought it may mean something to your question)

I started listening to metal when I was 14. At first, it was to give my life some meaning, along with the obvious belonging feeling. However, now, I don't give a shit. I listen to metal because that's the music I enjoy, that's the music I search for whenever I want something new. Sure, I'm pretty ecletic, and believe as a musician wannabe I have to listen to different stuff, but metal is, as I like to call it, the music I listen to in my natural state. By that, I mean that while I may enjoy listening to my friends' alternative bands, I won't listen to them unless someone recommends them to me, or something in those lines. Sure, there are times where metal is "the punching bag", but aside from that, metal is really cool music. If you believe I'm wrong to listen to everything and not be a "tr00 headbanger", fine, I don't give a damn. I listen to the music because I like the music, not because I look good in black leather. If I ever feel like listening to Maroon 5, I'll listen to it*. Without faking it under my badass face.

*I hope this never happens. The band is so bad.

That's my view on the subject, OP. Took me a 10min walk to college to pull it out. Hope it gives a different view on the subject
I actually got into metal for the opposite reason. I've always like very reflective music with large dynamic shifts. A lot of metal bands cover a large range of dynamics, moreso than rock, country, or jazz, and give a pretty unique listening experience. Bands like Opeth and Dream Theater really showed me how much ground music can cover dynamically. 

I guess when I was 15 Pantera was my favorite band though so there probably was a time when I was in it for the scene.
I started in metal in 1986. My elder brother came back from university with a huge record collection and influenced by him and what I heard I moved from rock to metal to thrash to death metal and eventually black metal and grindcore. Since then I've kept to the sounds I enjoyed and have no problem listening to anything. It's as long as the music or vocals (preferably both) have something to them. A meaning, a story, a lesson, an opinion (which doesn't have to be 'right').
So a lot of people use music to get out their anger. The only place I did when I was in my 20s was at a gig, in the mosh or stage diving. Being able to react to what I heard and enjoyed.
As long as you enjoy it what's the issue.
As i grew up the music i listened to got more complex and more difficult to play on drums and guitar and bass. Eventually i started listening to music where the vocalist occasionally growled or screamed. As i got used to that sounds, i started listening to bands that pretty much only did that. Now im here a trur metalhead because every aspect of the music, vocals and lyrics brings out all of my emotion.
I really love both, honestly, the feeling is more important to me. If you're putting out uninspired good music (I.e. whitechapel's latest album, which had great writing but bad lyrics) it'll kill it for me. Really dark and unorganized chaos, which most would consider crap, really intrigues me. Slipknot's set titled has both of this elements to me, being one of my favourite albums ever. Whitechapel's first is also like this.
Not all metal is angry. I think stuff like (for me) like slipknot... That appealed to my angsty side. I still love it, but it definitely appeals to those moods.

Power metal, folk metal, prog metal, melo-death are examples of sub genres that don't necessarily appeal to my angry side primarily.
I grew up listening to 80's metal with my dad as a 90's kid.  Then I branched out and started listening to Metallica, much to his chagrin.  But I enjoyed the heavier riffs and more powerful sound than the likes of Van Halen and Whitesnake.  (Don't get me wrong, those two bands are still awesome.)  Then I started listening more intently to older "metal" bands, such as Rainbow, Zeppelin, and Sabbath.  Then, one day, it all changed.  I heard a song called "Black Ice" off an album called An Evening With John Petrucci and Jordan Rudess.  The technical prowess showed by those two musicians in that nearly 11 minute song introduced me to a whole new world of music, and eventually to a new world of metal as DT has become my all time favorite band.

That brings me to an answer to your question.  I've been to a Dream Theater concert at least once a year for almost a decade now.  They've had quite the swath of opening acts, from Trivium to Opeth to Zappa Plays Zappa to Animals as Leaders, and I'll tell you, every concert group is different.  The opening acts always bring in such different groups.  I remember during the Opeth set there was a guy in front of me at the Orpheum in Boston with hair down to his knees and he had a 3 foot circle of space around him because he was "helicoptering" his hair and people were just letting him go.  But when DT came on, the fans stand there and watch and listen.  There isn't a lot of headbanging except for those songs that almost require it.  Those are my metal heads, the people who enjoy the virtuosity for what it is, amazing musicians playing amazing music at an amazing level.  And as far as I'm concerned, unless you go to classical music, the prog-metal and even thrash and heavy metal scenes are the only places you can find musicians who are truly at the top of their game with no one around to slow them down or tell them they're wrong.

So no, people are not only into metal for the scene and headbanging.  That's the vocal minority.  I've been to A LOT of concerts in my life, and the metal fans are always the nicest and most musically adept of any fans I meet.  They do love it for the music and technicality, you just need to find them.
For me: 80% musicianship 20% feeling 
For me it was never really about the anger, I didn't and still don't consider most metal to be "angry". Passionate? Yes, powerful? Yes? Angry? Less so though it certainly still exist at times. Maybe that's just cause I have no problem listening to /core genres that everyone except metal heads call metal as well. 

For me , as someone who grew up with a lot of classical music training, I just don't feel the draw to listen to metal for its "anger", I don't hear much of the 'anger" at all
I just find heavy riffs and crushing guitar tones to be very satisfying.  I listen to a lot of techy drum and bass for the same reason. 
Always loved the music. Over time my tastes have softened a bit and I can't really deal with super intense heavy stuff without it having *some* sort of melodic element. 

I mean Slayer's great and everything but right now in my life I way prefer the light and shade to something like Soilwork. I've just gotten into Gojira via Magma, and went back to L'Enfant Sauvage and love them both...just got The Way of All Flesh just yesterday and have to admit I'm not struck on it. Need those melodies man, they justify the heaviness.


Sure it's an outlet for my frustrations, but wall to wall noise is not my thing - it needs to be measured. If you have white and black, you have a contrast, if you have all white or all black, then half of the picture is missing. 

That's my opinion anyway, and of course it's all horses for courses really.
I was a pretty even balanced kid when I got into metal, I was around ten or eleven. I was a huge art nerd and I loved the horror and fantasy album covers. Turns out I loved the music too. I was a little too young to have much to be pissed over. 

Now as an adult, I love metal for the music, but still dig the dark imagery. With that said, a little Fucking Hostile goes a long way when you're pissed and get In your car! 
Hmm, I think this is really one of those things that showcases the difference between casual music listeners and those who listen more actively. Really, I think it's safe to say that we all listen to any kind of music for the "feeling", but casual listeners generally only see music as involving simple emotions, and if something is loud and harsh, it must be angry, or if something is dancy and upbeat, it must be happy. This is fine, but it's vastly different than listening intently to a song and interpreting that feeling to be akin to the frigid darkness of northern winters. Casual listeners also aren't going to analyze the music itself that much, it'll be limited to simple observations like "this groove feels good" or "wow, that's a fast guitar solo". In general, I imagine you're more likely to find serious active listeners the further you delve into any genre, while when discussing more mainstream acts you're likely to run into lots of casual ones. 

As a musician myself, and someone who's been exploring every bit of metal I can get my hands on since middle school, I do both. Sometimes, even if a band doesn't do anything spectacularly interesting, if they have the right energy, it feels good. Similarly, even if I don't neccessarily enjoy certain aspects of a bands sound, I can appreciate the musicianship or writing if it is exceptional. 
My girlfriend and I have been long time metal lovers, and we listen for both analysis as well as the feels, but we didn't get into it because we were angry. We like the crushing rawness and the power behind it. It's fun, cool, and gives me something to aspire to as a musician. Of course it's a go to when feeling upset, but we don't "rage." the kind of people that grow out of it are likely the same kind that like hardcore and shit like that, who've stated to me in discussion that they like being punched/kicked in the face at a show.. what even?

Our love for metal has grown, and we don't see ourselves out growing or getting tired of it. We love standard death metal, tech, prog, and everything in between, and don't limit ourselves. Metal is just where the heart is and will continue to be. 
As a writer of metal [music](http://www.kardashev.bandcamp.com), I find that I more regularly write for feeling. I personally want to draw out the somber and melancholy. 

I've found myself at one time or another writing with "groups" of listeners in mind.

[Chug patterns](https://youtu.be/58JZGvdO8M0?t=2m7s) to satisfy the head bangers.

[Melodies, leads, counterpoint](https://youtu.be/M6P0D5SOj9s?t=9m56s) for the shreddy kids.

[Off-time, metric modulation, and poly rhythms](https://youtu.be/vrVvpwNzq_4?t=5m43s) for the prog/ math kids.

And then I find myself at a crossroads, wherein, depending on the audience I find myself in front of, I ask myself,"Do I perform the less intricate bits for a better stage performance, or the sweet ass leads, sweeps and shreds for the technical admirers"?

At shows, as a fan, I find myself wanting both, separately. 

I want moments of body banging heaviness that facilitates my absolute animality. But I also want to sit back and groove, and admire the craftsmanship of their composition.

I guess it really depends on the band I'm endorsing.

[Oceano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKqZibet90Q), like a full moon to a Lupus Dei, I just want to reek havoc.

[The Contortionist](https://youtu.be/kRcFemSnmqw), I am a crop of wheat, swaying with the ebb and flow.

Shameless, after numerous self promotions, I think that patience and priorities influence whether music is a tool for people to pry out their feelings, and/or it serves the same purpose as a piece of [Art](http://puffin.creighton.edu/fapa/History%20of%20Art/Web-files/0New%20ART%20219%20Webfiles/how_to_analyze_a_painting.htm). To be loved and shared for it's more admirable qualities.

For me metal has such an insane amount of energy that I won't find in any other genre and I just need that in my music. Of course most bands also have more mellow songs and I think those are important too because they serve as a great contrast. You can't be on full power all the time. But it always needs to be interesting and fresh to keep me entertained.

As for the "feelings vs. the music itself"-question, I definitely listen to metal for both and that's part of the beauty of metal for me.
It depends on the subgenre, but I listen for a variety of reasons.

When I was younger, it was the energy/angst and I liked skating/playing along on guitar and feeling like I was a rock star. I rarely even noticed lyrical content.

Now it's almost purely for how it makes me feel. Some styles... Anaal Nathrakh or Sikth for example, calm me.

Others such as Katatonia, Swallow The Sun or Deftones are purely for listening to and enjoying, both lyrically and musically. Usually I play these kinds of groups in the car.

Finally, more extreme music such as Burzum or Cannibal Corpse I use to help me concentrate at work. I've also been listening to Deafheaven for similar reasons of late. Something about the ambience of these bands really gets me in the zone.

When I feel more like partying/getting pumped up (or drunk) I listen to bands like Alestorm, Flintroll or Korpiklaani.
I'm similar to some others in that metal was never cathartic for me or a way to get rid of anger or aggression. It has always just clicked with me and been the genre of music I enjoy more than any others.

And, actually, when looking at aggression research (putting on my psychologist hat for a sec) the "catharsis" theory of aggression has been roundly disproven. That is, engaging in aggressive behavior to "purge" aggression from your system doesn't work--it actually makes people feel more aggressive and behave more aggressively. I don't know if the same relationship is present with aggressive music (I doubt it) , but the catharsis theory doesn't really make much sense.
I initially got into metal simply because i like the sound and the anger aspect has never been a factor for me. Lately metal has evolved into a deeply profound and physical experience for me. I'm one of those people who gets chills/goosebumps when they listne to music and it has become my primary identifier if a song has really consciously or sub consciously resonated with me. No other genre of music does this me and these chills/goosebumps are accompanied by intense bouts of energy and joy. This is particularly evident when i listen to doom metal, melodic black metal, folk metal, mid tempo thrash, heavy power metal, insomnium style melodeath etc
It was the influence of my best friends mother and her mental friends that got me into rock and metal. We'd hang out while the adults spun their Maiden and Angelwitch LP's taking in the atmosphere... to a rebellious 13 year old who constantly skipped school this was a Eureka moment. It never was the "scene" or the "head banging"... it was the camaraderie and friendships we had and despite the crowd being slightly unhinged they were all very nice people to a fault. I got given my first demin jacket with patches and badges by them, even got a few 7" singles too... my parents naturally disapproved which made me even more curious and pig headed. Here I am 30 years later and I have not seen them for such a long time... time flies too fast enjoy it while you can.
I listen to it for motivation, like when you're involuntarily clenching your teeth.
Well, I dunno.

I got in touch with metal because of my brother (he was into Metallica, Iron Maiden, Sodom, and so on) - and of course I was into it, as I was copying my brother and so on.

When I was a teen, my brother still listened to some metal albums, but mostly he was into electronic music - which I didn't care about at that age. So I began to dive deeper into metal and discovered the beauty of death, black and what-not metal.

I also had a phase, where I was one of those "METAL OR DIE!!!111 \m/" fuckers, but thankfully that stopped when I got older. Jesus fuck, luckily that changed. Some of my friends of that time are still rolling like that. That's not only embarrassing, it's fucking stupid.

To address your comment about "relieving anger/frustration" - eeh, is it really like that? I mean, after a stressful day, I also like cranking up the volume and listen to some bad ass brutal death riffs (as it IS relieving my stress/frustration/anger in some way), but every style of music can achieve that - if you're into it, right?
I mean comments like that always got a "special taste", as it could imply that only people with problems find their way into metal.

So I completly get your point and I get pissed if I hear something like that: *boohoo, my daddy is an ass, that's why I listen to [genre]-core*. 

I love metal because of the music, my teenager years and all the things me and my friends did. Sounds super lame, but metal was and is the foundation of some of my best friendships.

But now that I'm older, I'm really happy that I also found taste in different styles of music.
Interesting topic. My group of friends, when they were into metal, listened mostly to traditional metal. Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Megadeth, etc. Some of it is still aggressive and a good outlet for anger, but not the same as that kind of death or black that has angry screaming vocals. We did however start out on nu metal which had tons of angsty screams, and it was a good outlet.

I know personally I have sort of stopped listening to metal for that component. Metal that is angry is no longer a draw, and can be a detractor, especially when the vocalist sounds screamo or core, I can't stand it. I still like emotion in my metal, and some anger is good. I like happy, meloncholic, exciting, etc metal. But I do find the songwriting most important. It's not a necessity but lead guitar is important. Good lyrics are a huge bonus. Ideally I get technicality with emotion. I find I listen less to chaotic angry sounding stuff such as *some* thrash less.
To me, metal is the best genre of music out there. I find more enjoyment listening to it than I do any other genre (maybe next to classical). The catharsis or anger venting is what got me into it, but I stayed even after that teenage angst was gone. I'm finding more and more kickass bands everyday, and in truth I think I'm just starting to find the metal music I like the most. 

The catharsis is still a big part of it. I feel like some days I really just need to take a seat, burn one down, and blast something into my eardrums. It's therapeutic. It makes sense. 

So I guess I'm a bit of both. A listener who really enjoys the music for what it is while also using it to reconcile some of my darker feelings and anger. 
I think mainly "passive" music listeners say stuff like that. People who just listen to music in the car, don't really dive deep into it like someone subbed to a /r/genre sub would. 
But when I'm angry, I want music that will release all the feel-good brain chemicals, and music that releases that is music I like. I read a study or something, saying that whatever music a person really enjoys is the one that releases oxytocin and dopamine and all that stuff.
Sure, when I was a teenager, I thought I was cool and 'different' because I listened to a niche music genre. 

But now? If it sounds good, I will give it a try. 
I just really love metal. I love the way it can speak to whatever frustrations I have built up, and I love the way it enshrines my mind and takes me somewhere else entirely. I love it loud, deafeningly loud, and pumping through my veins. I love old metal, classics and pioneers, I love softer and melodic metal, I love pissed off metal, I love progressive metal, I love frantic thrashy noise metal, I love atmospheric doom and or black metal, I FUCKING LOVE METAL.

It doesn't matter what mood I'm in, I can listen to metal. I listen to a lot of stuff, old hiphop, folk, americana, blues, indie, classical, etc etc; but no matter what state of mind metal always *always* hits that spot. 

I guess you could compare it to the way horror-film folks love horror: they can watch that shit at any time of day, night, weekend or weekday or whatever. It touches that nerve for them. I don't mind horror but it's not always my cup of tea like it is for that crowd; much like my metal music is not always what they are jamming out to. 

I'm a bit of an extremist admittedly, so maybe that ties into my love and admiration for my favorite music. I hope this is understood, being the thread we're on I'm sure you all feel the same to some degree :)
"Fate of Norns" by Amon Amarth is about a father coming to terms with losing his young son. The emotion that comes through both the lyrics and the music is anything but 'a punching bag'.

People's music tastes get set around the age of 14-15 along with fashion, politics and a bunch of other 'defining factors'. These are then pretty set for life (I'll provide a source if anyone is interested).

As a result, a number of people get into metal at that age and are as you would expect, angry, confused teenagers. So I can understand why the stereotype exists. Happy kids don't tend to listen to angst-laden pop metal bands that are so often the gateway onto the genre. (Show me a kid who's first metal album was grindcore and I'll show you a liar.)

So with all that in mind, the to stereotype exists for a reason, but beyond the gateway bands, things get a lot more complicated.

It's the same with all genres. Chances are you get into modern R&B because you want to feel cool, sexy and popular. That's very different to the topics discussed by the genre. Hell, just look at Frank Ocean's latest album.
I think the first thing that got me into metal was the musicianship. The technical playing really interested me and made me want to be a better guitarist. I do always tell people that a big part of me liking the music is the excitement that it gives me. It's not necessarily angry or delighted, but i just get energized.

So I guess you could say for me it's both the "feeling" and the music
I don't know if my opinion exactly counts, but I got into metal because I got tired of pop music since it was so untalented and everything was highly autotuned. Also to mention, this was when pop was starting to go into trap/rap music (so like mid 2015)(Yes, I am kind of new still to metal, but I have listen to a lot of rock/metal songs. I have at least 700 songs in my rock/metal playlist.), and I usually don't like trap/rap because the beat is usually very repititive and obnoxious, and plus the ways rappers rap can get pretty annoying as well by adding weird accents to words and just adding weird noises in general. Also to mention, the subjects, generally, they would rap about was obnoxious and reptitive too, since most of, again generally, is about clubs, drinking, prostitutes, etc. 

So anyways, I got into metal because it impressed me. The way how the music was so unique with the usual solos and difficult runs and music in general. And about each song I've listened to, they are all usually unique. Some songs I've listened to as well doesn't always talk about anger or rage. Some I've listened to talks about having hope, or just having fun, and some even talked about life in a great prespective. 

So, that is just my two cents. 
(I listen to both known artists, old artists, and unknown artist among the metal/rock community, btw. )
Started listening to it for the music, got into the "scene", went to festivals, liked it,will keep doing it...nothing more to it :D
Listening to metal alleviates bad thoughts for me. Hearing a sweet guitar riff, or a crazy drum roll...or a Marty Friedman solo or something. Gives me some adrenaline which makes the feels positive.
I like metal for it's energy. But it doesn't have to center around anger to be powerful and energetic. I tend toward classic metal because the energy comes through across the entire band, not just a couple instruments at a time. 
At first, it was for the feeling of anger, hate and general teenage angst for myself. I'm getting older and I still love metal. I can say that music itself when written correctly, anyway. Is pure unbridled emotion. 

I still listen to metal because I love the talent that it takes to do it. Keeping up with some bands that play so well and so fast, while composing full symphonies to go along with their music is just beautiful to me. While most bands of today's mainstream music write songs that are sometimes barely 3.5 minutes long. Metal songs (from my experience) usually are double that or longer. Along with the fact that they still have just musicals with no lyrics, but they are inspired to write the music that they cannot find the words to. 
Metal for me has nothing to do with anger or frustration. 

I listen for complexities in melody and instrumental prowess that you usually can't find in other genres. Sure, the aggression sometimes gives me chills, as the passion you can hear in the vocals or the thundering drum beats, or the layered guitars, but at this point in my music listening career, nothing sates like some good metal. 
Here's my story. 

I grew up in a military house. My dad was really into his marching band type of music. My mom, on the other hand, is really into Mozart and André Rieu. So that was pretty much all I listened to growing up. 

When I was in primary school my music teacher introduced me to alot of the really heavy classical musicians. Brahams, Tchaikovsky, Greig, etc. I instantly feel in love with them. Really irritated my mom, even though it is still classical music. 

Then, in high school, a friend of mine played me the weird music that his brother listens to. Turned out to be Rammstein and Nine Inch Nails. I was instantly hooked. This was heavier than most of the classical music I had access to, and was melodic and catchy to boot. 

From there my intetest just grew. Now, 20 years later, I'm firmly into prog metal. 

So, what does this have to do with OP's post? 

Well, I grew up in a very stable, loving, home. I was never an agro teen, but I was (still is) a big nerd. I also grew up living music more for the virtuosity than the feeling. Still, metal calms me. 

So, for me, it is a little bit of both and I think the vocal minority are mainly agro kids. I can't see myself outgrowing metal, just like I won't be outgrowing classical music. It is just to big a part of my life. 
> there's almost entire genre's of metal itself about things such as transcendence and Buddhist concepts

Do you have any examples, I read this part of your post and it really peaked my interest
Depends for me. Some bands I listen to because I like the music, some for the lyrical content and concepts, then there's bands I like for both, such as Amon Amarth, Ensiferum, Bolt Thrower, and 3 Inches of Blood.
I started to get into metal because I just liked heavy music.  Not sure why, i was just drawn to it.  Now its because I demand music that pushes the envelope.  Metal is arguably one the of toughest genres to play, especially if you get into more technical sub-genres.  I don't care about the aggression aspect.  Maybe I did when I was younger.  Certainly I enjoy a really heavy breakdown or riff, but its not for the aggression.   I just like how it sounds I guess?  For me its just about listening to the technicality of the players.  The other genres I listen to like jazz and prog rock all focus on that.  Most other hobbies I have I tend to really get into them.  I think I just am a person who has demanding tastes and expectations.  Whether it be beer, scotch, food, photography, or music, I just tend to try to get into the most extreme aspects of those hobbies.  To me, metal is arguably the most extreme form of music as far as technicality and how alienating it is to the average person.  So that's what it is for me. 
The music in itself evokes feeling and audial intensity when you're listening to a specific song. Sometimes the feeling occurs through progressional buildup in the album, or an instant hit whilst listening to it. I experience all sorts everytime which keeps me hooked on metal.
Experiencing music as a punching bag *is* a form of aural experience. I think of music as providing intellectual/cerebral, emotional, and/or physical stimulation. It either makes you think, feel, or want to move your body. Some bands and genres emphasize one of these over the others. For me, metal provides a good balance of all three, with individual bands and sub-genres providing these stimulations in varying degrees. Sometimes I'm looking for a cerebral experience, sometimes I want my soul moved, and sometimes I just want to headbang and smash my air guitar. Metal is broad enough that I can always find a band that suits the kind of stimulation I'm looking for at the moment.

Although I find metal energizing and emotional at times, I wouldn't say I've personally found it especially cathartic. I was a pissy teenager, constantly getting in fights, but I didn't connect that with my interest in metal. I wouldn't say metal helped me with my anger nor did it make things worse. By virtue of growing older, I did eventually calm down, but I still like metal. Maybe the fact that I didn't use metal for catharsis is the reason I never "outgrew" metal. Maybe (lots of maybes here) "former metalheads" used metal as a therapist and now no longer need that therapy. Metal was never my therapist, so there was no reason for me to move away from metal.
I listen to metal simply because I love listening to metal. Sure I can appreciate the technical aspects of the music, or the message the artist is trying to get across and so forth, but most of all I just love metal more than any other music genre. It's really the crunchy riffs, the muddy production and the pummelling drums that resonates with something within me. I know it sounds pretentious but that's the way it is. I  can understand where people come from when they say they want to get the anger and frustration out whilst listening to metal, but I think metal is so much more. The spectrum of human emotions that can be expressed through metal is huge.
I think it initially filled my need to express aggression, but then I grew up and my appreciation grew deeper. 
I got into metal for both reasons, really.  I'm a huge outdoor nut, I'm always hiking, camping, just in general being outdoors.  I love nature because of how it can be beautiful and relaxing, and at the same time be absolutely fucking terrifying.  I love music for the exact same reasons, but metal helps complete the spectrum for me.   At it's tamest its fun or haunting, at its most extreme, its wild, unrelenting, unexplainable, and something that can and will knock you the fuck down.  

So for me, I listen to metal in the same fashion I'll sit outside and watch a particularly nasty storm crawl its way to my residence.  It's a bit of adrenaline with a strangely comforting feeling of something that may seem 'dangerous' coming your way and there's nothing to be done about it.

All that nonsense, and my belief that all music needs to be appreciated in some way because it's such a pure and unbridled look into the collective human psyche.
Every 'scene' has it's serious fans, and it's posers, and I don't mean posers in the super negative manowar kills kind of way.  But that they were into it because it was popular at the time, and everyone wanted to fit in.  There isn't anything WRONG with that, and it's very common behavior.  

When i was in College in the mid 2000's it was all about Rap music, and the vast majority of my friends from those days "grew out of it" because they were never that into it, they just wanted to fit in.  Some were serious fans, and are still hip hop heads to this day. 

It's the same shit with metal music.  

The big difference I see with Metal as opposed to say...Rap or Country is that metal hasn't been mainstream for decades.  The entirety of the 2000's popular music is dominated by Rap, Country, and Electronic.  So you run into these people who maybe listened to Metallica back in the day, but the moment you put on anything deeper than surface level, and you get comments about "screamo", "How can you understand what they are saying" or "I grew out of it."

I don't listen to metal because I'm angry, I just love it.  Getting rowdy in the crowd after 2 joints and 4 beers is where I want to be, and if I can't be there, I'm content being 'that guy' in my office, who headbangs at his desk all day.

tl;dr 

Just people being people.

Way more for the music, I like classical music a lot and one of the few genres in current music that has a comparable degree of complexity and structure is metal, not all of it obviously, but i like listening to very skilled artist playing music.

Again, this is a simple opinion but i actually think in terms of venting anger and frustration Rap serves as a better medium, most metal is too melodic to focus on a especific feeling.
I do feel like I've "outgrown" the need for metal to be an outlet for anger. But I also really like the music, and now I listen to a lot more complicated or progg-y/atmospheric stuff. 
Honestly it ha so lucky been recently that I learned that people listen to it to relieve anger. I've always loved the sheer technicality and skill the genre requires
I originally got into metal as an angsty teen and although my specific taste have changed over time, I still find metal most interesting. Other forms of music just bore the shit out of me, some guy singing over the same 4 chords and same drum beat is just dumb as shit. The thing is that sort of repetitive dribble happens in metal, but besides going into classical music, I find technical forms of metal to be the only thing that interest me. So many of the greatest new metal albums are not about rage or death or negativity at all, but instead use the heavy medium of metal music to tell captivating and original stories. 

You could look any a band like rivers of nihil and hear the aggression and instantly thing that the song is about anger or something related, but alot of there music is about the concepts of man's impact on nature, our place in the universe, and many other deeply thought provoking ideas. 

Other cases are bands like dissonace in design who wrote an album which tells the story of the downfall of mankind through its own greed and self pursuit, but has a interesting message about the purification of man, rather than the idea of man's ruination like many people might interpret it as.

Too many people hear one distorted chord, or one distorted vocal part, and instantly think it's just like every other angry metal song that ever existed, but the truth is, metal is one of the most important and free mediums of artistic expression that exist in modern society. 
I listen to metal about 50% of the time, and the other 50% is split between classical, jazz, and all kinds of other stuff that is musically interesting to me. I love technically proficient bluegrass, for example, which might seem antithetical to my love of metal. To me, they aren't. 

Personally, I enjoy technical or musically complex metal. I've found most metal heads and audiences to be pretty intelligent and musically educated. Might be influenced by working at universities and being a former musician myself: I have an unusually biased sample, apparently. 

I've never enjoyed the "pure aggression" kind of metal or pseudo-metal that appeals primarily to angst, rage, anger, and hate. Other people can listen to whatever makes them happy, but I prefer music with depth and weight. And it needs to be interesting. 

So, for me, I'm definitely in the "metal as music" category, and have been from the beginning. When I really got into thrash as a kid, it was partially because it was mostly more musically interesting than (most) punk and pop. I still loved Bowie and The Talking Heads and Iggy Pop and later the Pixies and Sonic Youth. Still do. And I've never felt that listening to metal was an identity-defining characteristic that meant some music was off limits. I listen to all kinds of metal (and other music), and don't really give a fuck if someone else thinks prog isn't *real* metal. Do what works for you, I'll do what works for me. There are no gatekeepers or arbiters of musical taste. 

Tl;dr: metal is music, and I enjoy it as music. Bad metal is just bad music; good music transcends genre. 
I like metal for the sounds of the music. I like most kinds of metal or core, I can fall asleep listening to Iron Maiden or Thy Art is Murder, doesn't bother me because I like the music. It's a great way of passing time. It's the background noise to pretty much everything in life.

If I'm angry I prefer not to listen to music so I don't tie it to bad experience. 
For me personally everyone I know who is into metal is a huge nerd, including myself. We love that it isn't all pop or autobiographical themed, and has many elements of fantasy. I got into it because it just speaks to me in a way that most music doesn't, not as an outlet for aggression. I want music to deliver on its full potential and not hold back, really try fucking hard to move me, and metal does that in a lot of different ways (depending on the sub genre).

Anecdote: in high school I loved Dire Straits, The Beatles, and Tool, but none of that was really perfect to me. In a media class somebody blasted the opening bars of Blind Guardian "Into the Storm" and I was hooked in five seconds. Finally something that rocked in every way possible, and was about something I cared about!

Took a while to get into thrash and death, but honestly it is just like acquiring a taste for beer or wine, not because of my deep inner darkness.

Metal actually taught me to really appreciate two other unlikely genres: swing and opera. For their time, they are also all about kicking ass and taking names and holding nothing back.
With me, it's kind of both.
There are bands/genres I'll listen to when I'm trying to blow off steam, but at the same time there are bands/genres I listen to on the regular because they cheer me up, etc. But I enjoy metal for itself as well. So while that helps for an emotional connection, it's also something I thoroughly enjoy listening to for the music itself.
I'm 44. My mum was right - it's just a phase I am going through, likely to end when i kick the bucket. I got into metal through the hair metal bands in the 80s and stayed, no angst, anger or hatred for me.
I'm not gonna say I hate or that I despise when People say metal is therapeutic, releaves stress, etc. But I just do not feel the same way. I BELIEVE art is art, pure by itself, and needn't and shouldn't be justified by any means. If you listen to it because of the technical solos, the stress you relieve or the vocals, it doesn't matter. You listen to it allthesame, making you and your opinion as valid as any other.
However, I personally aprecciate it because of it's essence: rebellious, independent art. In a world where bands SEEM to aim for the mainstream income and fame, I personally tend to indentify more with the "trve kvlt" metal, since in MY OPINION it is where the true nature of art is hidden in contemporary music.
 I study art (still a high School student), and try to draw a parallel between metal/music and other art styles (paintings, sculptures, architectures, etc). Art's goal is not to please People, to releave stress or to be a macho man. Art's goal is to be, not to do.
Of course that's my opinion
It is a mix for me, i originally began getting into more extreme metal when i was around fourteen. Of course at that age it was due to being edgy and angsty, i'll just say God Hates Us All was my favorite ablum... Yeah, it was bad. At this point (i'm 20 now) i still love the music, but i listen to a wide variety of different genres, if i put my music on shuffle it could go from Cattle Decapitation to Simon and Garfunkel, to Black Sabbath. The main reason i listen to the music now is both as a means to let energy out, and for the lyrics, depending on who i'm listening to. If i'm at the gym i'll have Cannibal Corpse, Slayer, Amon Amarth, Havok, etc, playing. On my way to work early in the morning or going to school i'll listen to Cattle Decapitation to wake me up and give me energy, and Neutral Milk Hotel on my way home to chill out. That's not to say i can't just lean back and chill out to some Dying Fetus, i do it all the time, but i mainly listen to metal now to give myself energy. Though there are a few bands out there that have some really decent lyrics, that can touch on some deep concepts that i enjoy (no, sorry Cannibal Corpse doesn't make this list). For example, i put on Unnatural Selection the week leading up the the election, if i'm relaxing while reading i might put on Leviathan or Burzum, if i want something more emotional, maybe Dream Theater. It really depends on the band, i prefer bands that have more meaningful lyrics, be it politics, philosophy, religion, history, etc, but that doesn't stop me from putting on Trample the Weak, Hurdle the Dead when the mood strikes me. Overall the music itself is what the attraction is, the complete 180 you can get in metal is incredible, Iron Maiden, Necrophagist, Megadeth, Opeth, Sunn O))), Tristania, Leviathan, and Tyr are eight different bands, eight completely different sounds, all under the umbrella of "metal". I get different feelings and different "benefits" from each artist, so my reasons for listening to them are different.
About half of the "metalheads" I know do not look like metalheads. One looks like a steroid eating disco rat, another is also into rap and dresses more like one, the third attended an Amon Amarth concert after his work with his suit still on, not to mention the IT guy.

Me? I usually listen to music whatever I do, 75% of that being some sort of metal, also I sleep like a baby to Moonsorrow.

No anger involved, little to no trash metal I like, and no I'm not a bloody poser who overdresses because it's "metal".
When I'm pissed I listen to Baroness' Yellow & Green and/or Purple, which don't even count as metal depending on who you ask. I've never really been a depressed or sad person, always a glass-half full kinda guy. 

Beats me why I listen to shit like Pig Destroyer.
Personally I just listen to it for the music. The scene doesn't interest me too much but listening does help me relax sometimes. One extra plus is I'm a teenager and when arguing with my parents I can just blast some dark throne for payback.
I've been listening to metal for about 16 years now. Not once have i moshed or used it to vent anger.

I love the other-world atmosphere of it, when it draws me into another place. I used to listen to a lot of Power Metal and epic music for this effect. I think i was also drawn to the idea that i actually was listening to music i found - not what was put in my face.

I later starting craving more extreme genres of metal. Again, not for anger venting / depression etc. My favourite genre is Death/Doom Metal, and i find it uplifting.

I think a good indicator that you listen to metal for the music is when you don't give a shit about lyrics. I haven't cared for those in many years - i often just need a theme for the song and make my own atmosphere up.
Ah, well, I guess now would be a good time to retell my story. 

I grew up around rap, hip hop, pop, R&B, country. My life was so saturated by it. In fact, the majority of the music I had listened to came from my two older sisters. We were all foster children, myself, my eldest brother, my oldest sister and my older sister. 

We were moved from home to home to home to home, so I was introduced to many different forms of music at a young age. 

Then in 1998, when I was but a wee 8 year old, I was moved along with my siblings to a "family home," which was newspeak for orphanage. We were allowed TV once a day and for an hour. This was during the era when hip hop and rap were getting popular on MTV, and a lot of the people in the orphanage wanted to listen/watch. 

It was May 21. I remember MTV touting it was Metallica's newest video. 

Until it Sleeps. 

I had never heard metal before that(save the argument, folks), let alone seen a video like that. It blew my goddamn mind. I was swimming in a sea of emotions I had never felt before, and by God it was glorious. I needed to hear it again. Every day, I watched MTV. They played the crap out of it. 

...then the State found us a home. And like that, MTV vanished. Metallica vanished. 

My brother is 6 years older than me. At the time he had a tape deck stereo boombox that he carried with him everywhere. He happened to have the Load tape, and I begged him to let me borrow it one day. The words "no," "hell no," and "keep dreaming," still ring in my head. 

I eventually "borrowed" his copy of Load just so I could listen to that song. 

...fast forward to this day and Death/Thrash/Groove metal are the only ones that really give me that feeling anymore. 
I got into metal because it allowed me to release anger and depression that I had in a healthy way. I'm no longer that way so I'm mostly in it for the music. That doesn't mean I *never* get mad, however, so it still helps for that.
As mostly a fan of the atmoblack, pagan, folk-metal/neofolk/ritual ambient, stoner, and emergently so space rock and dungeon synth genres it's *definitely* about the atmosphere. More than any level of angst, seeking of technicality or extreme heaviness, or even any identification with lyrics (I pay them no mind). Give me a general framework of the aesthetic with some album art and song titles and set me adrift with songs you can get lost in. I would say that's the general theme of what I get out of metal and all music, really- **escapism**. Hypnotic, trancelike soundscapes are a certain quality that can really transcend the musical style be it heavy, folky, electronic, or what have you. Nile for example are generally a straightforward heavy dose but they have some great songs like *Wrought* that really pull you in. Or a more recent example of Vektor. Yeah, they're thrash but definitely possess 'more' to their sound of this somewhat intangible element, which is why I think they're so popular anymore because that have that quality, but also the speed and riffage, drawing in two different types of fan to the music.
I listen to metal for the music. I'm an extremely happy person all the time. I've never used metal as an outlet for anger, sadness after a breakup definitely, but never straight anger. 

I enjoy the level of skill it takes to play the genre and the topics discussed too. Lyrical content is extremely important to me. I really don't see myself ever outgrowing it and I feel like I'll be listening to this for the rest of my life. Started when I was 17 and I'm now 20, still going strong and I still go to concerts and I still get extremely excited when I find a new band that I like.
Why not both?
To sort of summarize my own feelings (as well as the mass of comments that are already here) there's a lot to be said for both aspects of metal that you describe. Once in a while if I'm in a dark place I like to crank something really aggressive, close my eyes, and use it as a mental punching bag.

Day to day though, I still prefer Metal to every other genre because it appeals to me musically. There is so much diversity within the genre that I can always find something to match my mood. I tend to gravitate toward more melodic power metal groups like Blind Guardian and Epica because the music is so dynamic and diverse (even just within a single song). It's also very complex and technical from a musical perspective, so I can simultaneously rock out and geek out.

There's also a side to metal that the uninitiated rarely see; the musically beautiful side. A great many groups really make an effort to create a complex emotional experience in their music (and not just the more melodic sub-genres; death metal can be fucking transcendental). I think it's part of why Classical music and Metal go so well together; there's a very similar blend of raw power and finely crafted beauty. I enjoy the works of classical artists like Grieg and Beethoven, but the most beautiful, most emotionally moving pieces of music I've ever heard were written by metal artists.
I listen to it because when i listen to anything else i get bored as fuck and keep thinking i could be listening to metal right now.
When I first got into metal, it was as an angsty teenager and I only really listened to super "hardxcore" shit.. lol. But then when I started playing guitar I started listening to older metal and now I listen to it for the music 
I listen for the music. I love the variety in metal. I go to metal shows for the feeling. I've never found a better feeling than the energy of a crowd at a good metal show.
I originally got into metal in high school. Or, at least, what I considered to be metal. I was an emo/scene kid in high school and listened to The Devil Wears Prada and Bring Me the Horizon. Eventually, I grew out of that stage, but I continued to delve deeper into the genre. Of course, what I listened to was pretty much metalcore. Eventually, I got into death, thrash, doom, black, prog, stoner, etc. 

At first I got into metal to fit in, but as I got older, I started to appreciate the complexities of it. Nowadays, I listen primarily to prog and stoner/doom metal, just because it helps me relax and unwind. Don't get me wrong, I love me some technical death and grindcore, but only when the mood really strikes me. 
For me it's both, but if I was going to side with one or the other, I think I would put the majority of the emphasis on the feeling, at least for some subgenres of metal.

Black metal for example is almost entirely about the stylized expression. Neoclassical on the other hand would be almost entirely about the composition.

So it does depend from genre to genre what I find important, but over all I gravitate to different genres depending on what I'm interested in for that moment.
I actually feel like I have lived through the same thing that you describe with Metallica. When I was younger I loved metal because it expressed how I feel Ed and it let me blew off some steam.   
But now I just love the music, but I mostly listen to blackmetal, postblack and classics now. Especially black metal overwhelms me often times with the esthetics of the sound. It's really hard to express that in English for me. 
>i see huge swathes of people talk about how they only got into metal because of their own personal anger and frustration and the music relieves that in a sense, and now they've "out-grown" it

Never happened for me, but overall from my favourite bands there's very few anger/rage types and more the more musically complex and abstract side of metal, or variants which while fast and headbangable, are far more varied in actual lyrics and themes.

>Do you think it's generally the case that people are really only into Metal for the "scene" aspect or just the "head-banging", or is that just the vocal minority? 

Vocal minority. There's a lot of teenagers there but I'd say it's rare to find many people like that past early 20s (I have known a couple, so they do exist, but are overall rare). Such fans tend to gravitate towards either false metal and stuff that gets mislabelled as metal (-core, screamo, etc.) but will unfortunately probably forever be associated, or thrash (which I don't mind, it's possibly my least favourite mainstream metal genre but there *are* some good bands to be found).
varies from band to band. as a drummer i am always listening for tasty fills (see the first 2 dissection records for the best ever) but other than that i dont really think about why i like certain music. except for samhain. they are my favorite band and i like that music for both reasons.
Let me just offer this: I'm the metalhead among my friends and family. When they come over, the metal stays on. I've found that without exception, their little kids always love the metal. Always. No matter what type of music they're used to. I've had infants who can't walk or speak, crawl over to my speakers and point at them until I put in metal. I've had 2 year olds moshing in my living room(*without being shown or told what moshing is*).  I've had a 3 year old tell me "I like the music that goes RAAAAAAAHHHH!"

My point is, none of these kids is into metal to fit into a scene or trend. None of them have rebellion or anger issues yet. They are completely pure and honest and they love metal.

Clearly it's the energy they love about it. And they don't care about genres. 
Does anyone know anymore about the new album they were supposed to be putting out? 
I keep coming back to their sophomore album, it's so hypnotic!
Such a great band. Maybe someday they'll do a US tour.
Wow, this song is kickass!

Thanks for sharing \m/
I saw this band listed the other day on MA and passed on them. That was a mistake. 
There are some bands that have awesome names, but the music doesn't live up to the name. Witch Vomit is NOT one of those bands.
Fucking hell, what a band name! Good song, too, I can dig it. Kinda has a crust or old school grind vibe going. I get on kicks where that's all I'll listen to. But yeah,**wow**,that fucking band name.
I thought they stole my username for a second! Regardless, this is great.
Yep, still haven't heard a good metal cover of that song. I think it's 0 for 7 at this point.
So damn awesome and unique. The cleans come out of nowhere, but they fit the theme and feel of the song so well.
SPECTERS OF BITTERNESS AND CONFUSION CIRCLE MY HEAD  
Fuck yeah, Georgian metal! მეტლებს სალამი, ფოლსებს სიკვდილი!
Holy shit,never thought I would find motherland's metal on fucking front page
Oh man, this [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bADuUjWTdnI) of theirs. Singer is what I imagine Rob Halford would have been if he sang for Survivor.
I'm pretty sure that the first thing people in Eastern Europe did after the Berlin Wall fell was form metal bands.
Love that script. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_scripts
So rad.
This is fucking fantastic, listening to the LP right now. Thanks for sharing! 

EDIT: Do you have any more like this? 
Shit, man. It's hard to find anyone else in person who knows Lord Gore.
God fucking dammit yes.   
That old Razorback-style portland deathgrind scene was so AWESOME. Lord Gore, Splatterhouse, Engorged, Whore, Frightmare, Blood Freak, Maniac Killer... I seriously miss those bands.   
The closest current thing I can think of are Smut and Haemophagus.
Try saying that 5 times fast. 
I remember when I first heard Lord Gore. Such a gnarly, yet catchy sound. 
Man this production is so on point. So many goregrind bands fail in this area but when I first heard lord gore I was like floored by how disgusted I was. The gooey pukey disgusting wet vocal production is really what puts these over the top. Such a solid album. 
Reminder that the new album dropped today!
That photoshopped band pic... haha
What is it with metal bands and quicksand
Annoyed that this isn't really clicking with me. Aelin didn't either. 

It's strange; I love Mortalicum, so much I travelled to Sweden to see them play. Same songwriter and more to my taste style-wise but I just don't really like it.
Feel free to disagree on the In Flames comparison, but the lead guitars reminded me of their early material quite a lot. Maybe At the Gates' early stuff might have been a better comparison? Either way this entire album is fucking gold, very glad it got released after over two decades along with the rest of their discography.

They're also releasing a new album around March next year on Dark Descent! "Within the Sphere of Ethereal Minds". [Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/sarcasmsweden/photos/a.786420698054770.1073741826.217639118266267/1438420096188157/?type=3)

**[Woe](https://woeunholy.bandcamp.com/album/a-spell-for-the-death-of-man)**  [Brooklyn, NY]

We're a black metal ("blackened extreme metal" if you want to argue semantics, which I don't) band that I started in the Philadelphia area almost 10 years ago. It's all rooted in the riffing and arrangements of old Emperor, Ulver, Darkthrone, and Dawn in but I've never been able to shake the punk/hardcore I played as a kid, so some influences creep in. (We've covered Aus Rotten and Dystopia for years.)

 Four full lengths, last two on Candlelight Records, new one is coming out early next year on VENDETTA, a killer German label. We'll be doing our first European tour in April, including an appearance at Roadburn's main stage on Saturday the 22nd.

**[Unrest](https://unspeakableaxerecords.bandcamp.com/album/grindcore)**  [Philly/Brooklyn]

This was my band with Brooks and Steve from Crypt Sermon and TrenchRot for many years. It's grindcore (heavy on the core) that started with the goal of just ripping off Nasum. An album collecting most of our material came out last year, a few years after we recorded it, and it's been really cool to have it out in the world. We always talk about doing more but it's tough with our other bands and the distance.

Hey all! We are a heavy metal band with some thrash and prog influences. We just released our first music video and more are on the way! We don't really dream of coming to US just now, (though it would be awesome if we had a fanbase there!). We are looking forward to your feedback too!!

Here's the [link](https://youtu.be/TIvMBVeXTms) to our music video.
**The Devouring Void** [Évora, Portugal]

Instrumental Black Metal I guess? This is a project I did so I could learn how to program drums. Since I'm not a drummer, this was the best I could do.

[Mindrippper](http://mindripper.bandcamp.com) [Aarhus/Denmark]

**Beetlegork** - [WI, USA] Sludge Metal
www.facebook.com/Beetlegork

We're a 3 piece Sludge band that builds heavily off of making things spacey and huge, while maintaining a crushing heaviness. We're working on a little 2 song EP/demo right now that should be out next month, and we're planning on recording an album over winter. We're also on Instagram as @beetlegork

Here's a live video of one of our songs :

**V. Ritola** [Finland] - I wrote some tracks during 2016, and decided to make them into a short demo. Genre would be progressive-ish melodeath-ish? 


I Recorded, mixed and mastered everything myself mostly for fun and learning purposes. Overall I'm positively surprised of the results, although there is still much to improve (shitty lead guitar especially, I consider myself mainly a bass player).


Feedback of any kind is always welcome. If you like what you hear, I'm also open for all collaboration suggestions. Go waste 10 minutes of your day here:

1x ticket to see Kreator next March in London, really looking forward to it. Kreator are one of my favourite bands and I've never actually seen them live.

Sepultura, Soilwork and Aborted supporting, not a huge fan of modern Sepultura and not too familiar with the other two but I'll check them out anyway if I get inside the venue in time.
It was my birthday earlier this week so I got a few vinyls although I haven't bought anything.

Black Sabbath - Master of Reality

Sleep - Dopesmoker

Opeth - Blackwater Park
**CD's**

* Opprobrium - Serpent Temptation
* Darkthrone - Total Death
* Necroccultus - Encircling the Mysterious Necrorevelation
* Unaussprechlichen Kulten - People of the Monolith
* Toxemia - Planetary Devastation
* Usul - Flames and Blasphemy
* Rabies - Death Sentence to Mankind

**Digital**

* Howls of Ebb - Cursus Impasse: The Pendlomic Vows
* Malleus - Storm of Witchcraft

Total Death is Darkthrone's best Moonfog-era album IMO. It's an underrated gem in their discography, the production really makes the riffs stand out, I like the Hellhammer-ey vibe. 

Picked up a great reissue of Necroccultus, Unaussprechlichen Kulten for a soundtrack to bathe in the black ichor of Tsathoggua, and supporting some excellent local bands from Mort Humain distro.

Well-done Hellhammer worship is my thing, so Malleus tickled me the right way. I only recently listened to the latest from Howls of Ebb and after one listen through the album it was an instant buy. Unhinged and deranged black/death, lots of variety, will likely be in my best of 2016 list.
Purchased:

Mgla - With Hearts Toward None
Mgla - Exercises in Futility
Forteresse - Themes pour la rebellion

Amazing albums I recommend to all
**PHYSICAL**

—---------

**METAL**

**[Enucleator - Demo 2016 (2016, USA, Black/Death Metal)](http://imgur.com/XAyURwW)**

Filthy black/death in the vein of Revenge, though it feels more firmly planted in black metal. (War/Bestial metal fans might want to correct me here as I’m no expert.) It’s a shame the band seem to have split because this is a glorious mess of filth and decay. Just listen to [this](https://enucleator.bandcamp.com/track/enucleator) and [this](https://enucleator.bandcamp.com/track/punishment). I know, right? What an angry bunch of young men. Whenever I feel like not giving a rat's arse, this is what I put on.

**Grave Miasma - [Endless Pilgrimage](http://imgur.com/o6jeymU), [Odori Sepulcrorum](http://imgur.com/cUEzHX5) (2016, 2013, UK, Occult/Cavernous Death Metal)**

I’ve been listening to Endless Pilgrimage on and off this year. When it came out there was lots of other music on my mind so it didn’t get a proper chance to sink in. A shame, because Endless Pilgrimage is a shining example of how Death Metal can be twisted and turned in to just about whatever you fancy. A bit like Akercocke, Grave Miasma imbue their cavernous assault with occult themes and a stately ritualistic feel the former do so well. There’s a distinctly British sense of drama to the madness - bit of goats blood with your tea, like.

As for the physical releases for these two albums… They are gorgeous. The artwork for *Endless Pilgrimage* shines when laid flat and the LP layout is excellent. There’s a poster too, though I tend not to display them. *Odori Sepulcrorum* looks no less spectacular, although the artwork isn’t as notable.


**[Auroch Taman Shud (2014, Canada, Death Metal)](http://imgur.com/POrnqLf)**

Again, there’s an occult feel to Auroch. But instead of the stately approach of Grave Misasma, they see fit to batter you into accepting our Lord and Saviour Satan. They play a dizzying, cyclonic style of death metal not that dissimilar from mid-period Gorguts. There’s a bit more oomph behind them though, and less outright experimentalism. Take the [first track](https://profoundlorerecords.bandcamp.com/track/villainous) off this album, for example. It’s spidery and vertigo inducing, yet lean and to the point. The rest of the album follows this same pattern, sometimes to a fault. It’s good that it’s so short - any more and it would be too much.

[Vetala's 2014 album, "Lord of Eternity"](http://i.imgur.com/LI7vjMh.jpg)

Super raw LLN worship, prefer Satanic Morbid Metal over this but it's still pretty damn good.
I spent 18 fucking quid on the special edition of the new Metallica album because I'm dumb as fuck. It comes with a third disc and I have no idea what's on it, but I'm hoping for that price that it's the rights to Lars' first born child.
Got a bunch of CDs this week.

Metallica's new album
Metallica's "Hardwired... To Self-destruct" and the 2011 rerelease of Katatonia's "For Funerals to Come..." EP, both on CD. Wasn't my intention to buy so many ellipsises this week. 
Young And In The Way - When Life Comes To Death [CD]

Scorched - Echoes Of Dismemberment [CD]

Additionally, my folks bought me Power Of The Riff tix for Christmas. 
Last night I purchased the 2013 Century Media remaster/reissue of **Sacramentum - "Far Away From the Sun** on CD ([CMDistro](http://www.cmdistro.de/Item/Sacramentum_-_Far_Away_From_The_Sun/1460)), which I'm really looking forward to receiving so I can read through the booklet etc. and listen through as a sort of holistic experience. On similar lines I also ordered the 2014 Century Media remaster/reissue of **Dawn - "Slaughtersun (Crown of the Triarchy)"** on CD ([CMDistro](http://www.cmdistro.de/Item/Dawn_-_Slaughtersun_-Crown_Of_The_Triarchy--Re-issue_2014-/1923)), which fucking *blew me away* when I listened to it last night. The opening and closing tracks in particular are God-tier Swedish melodic black/death. It's a style of music that doesn't really exist anymore - I think perhaps many bands were pushed under by the success/controversy of Dissection, combined with the Gothenburg melodic death sound taking off around that time, which many bands jumped on the bandwagon.

Beyond that, I also ordered **Watain**'s live CD/DVD **"Opus Diaboli"**, which should have arrived yesterday. Amazon says it's been delivered but it hasn't, and I was home at the time they said it was delivered... Irritating. Also received the limited edition mediabook version of **The Wild Hunt**, though I was somewhat disappointed with the booklet given how excellent *Lawless Darkness*' was.

Bought Amon Amarth Jomsviking Tour T-Shirt and going to buy Metallica's new album after I leave work :D

* [Spirit Division - No Rapture](https://spiritdivision.bandcamp.com/album/no-rapture)


Excellent Album of the Week, Finishing up grabbing Helstar stuff after their superb-but-short show last weekend. Sat on picking up Lethal Steel waaaay too long. Quicksand Dream's a new release, and the other two are some Doom picks - Not going to [Doomed and Stoned Indy](http://www.doomedandstonedfestival.com/) this weekend, but I wanted to support it & some of the bands there so I'll be picking up their stuff for a while.
**Clothing**  
Got in a Darkthrone shirt that turned out to be a terrible [bootleg](https://puu.sh/sjDrM/992afddd5f.jpg).  As soon as Amazon processes the return, I'll be replacing it with an official shirt.  Last time I make that mistake.  
**Vinyl**  
Dark Tranquility - Atoma  
Morbid Angel - Alters of Madness  
Emperor - Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk  

The DT and Emperor were both colored, so that was a pretty nice surprise.
Just an Adversarial zip up hoodie this week.
Saw **Subrosa** and picked up a shirt from them. I've bee listening to their new album a lot recently and they put on a great show to an enthusiastic crowd. I've seen them once before and they were decent, but I feel like they've gotten better and were playing with more intensity this time around. Rebecca's vocals have always been a kind of weak point for the band, but sounded significantly better than last time I saw them. 

Also caught **Tombs** and **Wolvhammer**. To be honest I have only listened to either of them a couple times, but figured I'd check it out. I enjoyed both sets and will give Tombs a little more attention, but my favorite band of the night was actually one of the openers I hadn't heard of before, a post/sludge group called [Wovoka](https://wovoka.bandcamp.com/). 
Got Metallica's new album on CD, got Black Album, Number Of The Beast, and Appetite For Destruction on vinyl
Tried hard to buy a Xerath T-shirt but they are small and hardly supported, they never have a medium!
Finally picked up the dual EP from Defeated Sanity and Defeated Sanity "Disposal of the Dead/Dharmata" Been loving both sides immensely
Xathur's Subliminal Genocide (digital) 
Eternal Champion -  The Armor of Ire

I'm really conservative when it comes to buying music. I add a lot to my wishlist and eventually come back and buy it later, but I'm glad I picked this up. I also got roped into going to Not So Silent Night this December, which should be interesting. I've only been to metal concerts so it will be a new experience, at least I'm going with some good friends and my sister though.
Highways gonna love this. Per his rec, Dead Congregation: Purifying Consecrated Ground, Rehearsal 2005 EP, and the Nuclear Winter demo. Will be getting the other two albums soon. Hopefully next payday. Still looking for the splits 

Iconoclasm - Out for Blood EP. Came with the digital self titled. Awesome thrash if you don't know them 

Hidden Haze self titled; weird stoner metal. 

Beerwolf - Oracles Prophecy, more weird stoner music, this one gets into more rock territory. 

Red Stone Souls - The Slow Haze Sessions, definitely not metal but definitely groovy 
[Cantique Lepreux - Cendres Celestes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUf0kBbGsIE) Digipack CD

[Fortresse - Themes pour la Rebellion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwdFqCnF8io) CD

[Ellende - Todbringer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdG-9ZLZYzk) Digipack CD

[Pg.lost - Verses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRhkHwMq9Es) Digipack CD

The Cantique Lepreux and Fortresse have got to be my favourite black metal albums this year.
Most recently, though admittedly not this week, I bought the full discography of Oathbreaker on vinyl. 
Bought a ticket to [Impericon Never Say Die Tour](http://www.impericon.com/uk/impericon-never-say-die/). This sunday in Barcelona. Basically I go to see Fallujah, but there are a bunch of neat bands like: Carnifex, Thy Art is Murder, Whitechapel, Obey the Brave, Make Them Suffer and Polar.

Gonna buy some t-shirts too, that's for sure :D
Yesterday I picked up a green vinyl of Master of Reality by Black Sabbath, and today my Iron Reagan hoodie and Death's "The Sound of Perseverance" on splatter vinyl came in the mail today. 
I saw Vektor and Black Fast in Vancouver last Friday; I bought a shirt from each band, and a copy of Terms of Surrender on CD for a friend.  

**CDs**  
* Metallica - Hardwired... To Self-Destruct

Been repeating their On Strange Loops alot already so i had to revisit their older releases again, long time since i've even listened to this band.

Other than that another pre-order in the dissonant death metal vein, been many of those this year.

Karmacipher - [Necroracle](https://karmacipher.bandcamp.com/album/necroracle)
Im about to buy 6 Revenge Lps, just waiting on shipping prices before I send off cash. 
Bought an MP3 version of the Pacific Myth remix by Protest the Hero that came out today. Upon first listen, the original mixes were better. Oh well.
Was my birthday so got a few vinyls from my girlfriend. The new Devin Townsend, the new Opeth and Morningrise too. Also got Ocean Machine on the way too.
Picked up some new cds at Amoeba records in San Francisco. 
Blood Incantaion - Starspawn
Vader - The Empire
Vektor - Terminal Redux
Defeated Sanity - Disposal of the Dead/Dharmata

Also went and saw Whores/Torche/Red Fang last night and snagged some t shirts. All the bands were great. 
Fun fact: With the dots over the O, their band name translates to "That shirt" in Swedish. 
> best album art 

No kidding, it's like a Hammer horror poster.
Thank you, been on a NWOBHM kick lately that was starting to die out. This should help.
Are you on a Speed Metal kick kaptain? Oh boy...here it comes, I'm going to start listening to my playlist of all the Speed Metal I have again in all forms on shuffle.(70s Speed Metal all the way up to resurgant Black/Speed)

See what you did...?
You beat me! Haha,  I didn't think anyone else here was hyped for this, glad it's getting some attention!
It's alright, I think I prefer the comp from earlier this year. A little too melodic for my tastes.
Mixing is just terrible. Thanks, but no thanks.
https://eibon.bandcamp.com/album/entering-darkness
Had the pleasure of seeing this song performed live last month (with Drakkar, Killers and ADX too). Seeing a crowd of old french metalheads singing along the songs of their youth was a cool experience. 
I love Warfare. I got Metal Anarchy - The Original Metal Punk Session on vinyl...it's really awesome to have another version of Metal Anarchy and the mixing and everything sounds great. This could have very well been the album...I wonder why they decided to rerecord not one album, but 2 albums.

I might eventually pick up Pure Filth from the Vault of Rabid Metal. Also because Warfare is being discussed, I just have to mention this...

"In 1985, the band was asked to open for Metallica at the Hammersmith Odeon, but were expected to pay for their own expenses. In protest, they played in the parking lot during the show, where Evo threw his mic stand at the Odeon manager’s car and smashed the Warfare truck into seven parked cars, resulting in enough damage to land the band in court on criminal charges."
Is this one of the albums Lemmy or Chronos was a part of?
Whoever mastered that loves their compressor.

Walk over to gig.  
  
I very often go to these guys's house because it's walking distance to a fair few gigs, and these are my "gig friends" anyway. It's real cool knowing these guys because sometimes they tell me of gigs I hadn't heard coming. Like one time I showed up at their place just to drink, and they told me that Magrudergrind and Shackles were playing that same night for $10. Fuck yeah.
Never listen to the band the day of
Eat beforehand so I don't pay $30 for a bag of chips at the venue, take a shower because I need to make up for the 12+ other people who won't, get there an hour early so I don't gotta fight other people for parking, cry in my car because of how much parking in LA costs, arrive at the venue and find a spot where I can lean against the wall or railing so I don't stand there the entire time wondering what to do with my hands inbetween lukewarm clapping for the opening local band. 

Oh and then have a startling realization I forgot my earplugs at home. Frantically abandon my spot and run around trying to see if the venue sells them. Arrive back at my spot to see someone spilled beer and or vomit in the spot I was standing. 

Stand in beer and or vomit the rest of the show. 

Something along those lines.
I don't really have a pre-gig ritual, more post-gig ritual.

I go to concerts with my dad (Started in '08) and he drives us all over the UK for these shows, whenever we're on our way back home from a concert we'll always put on Dream Theater's - A Count of Tuscany when we're 20 minutes away from home. He tries to see if we can get on the drive by the time the song finishes. 

If it's a "closer to home gig" we always have bacon sandwiches when we get home. 
Be very careful to *not* get drunk before (or during) the show - because not remembering the majority of a long-awaited concert is .. not fun.
Grab my vest, eat a ton so that I don't have to pay for venue food, clean my ear plugs if I haven't already, repair my vest if it's falling apart. Nothing else really. 
* Get my Doc Martens, band shirt, jeans & vest

* Get my I.D, wallet & earplugs

* Get on the train 

* listen to some death metal

* go on the bus 

* locate the nearest store for beer 

* buy 3 bottles of beer

* finish them before entering the concert

* have fun


Gas up. Last thing I want to do is not make it to the place
Eat fried chicken ---> get loaded.
1. Get off from work / out of bed.
2. Drink beer at friends place.
3. Go to venue.
4. Stand in the back, arms crossed, unimpressed by opening band.
5. Peruse merch table, conclude that everything is too expensive.
6. Go to bar, drink beer.
I usually do something to chill out. Play a video game, work on some project, watch something online, things like that. I have social anxiety, and the idea of going into a dense crowd of energetic people always gets me kind of agitated. I have to relax myself beforehand, otherwise I end up going to the show feeling like the world is about to end. 
* Make sure to take a dump before the show.  
* Get Wawa.  
* Just a couple beers, don't watch the bands I don't care about.  
* Go to a diner afterwards.
Eat like a king,
Drink like a king,
Go to show feeling good,
Listen to awesome music feeling better
2 beers and a couple of bowls.
Grab earplugs, find parking near the venue (impossible to get a bus most places late at night), listen to the band in question on the way there, take as little as possible and stand near the front so I get the cups of water. I always take only car keys, £30 or so for a T shirt and my phone for emergencies (never for filming).
wear a diaper for 3 days
• Take the spikes off my vest
• Roll a few. Maybe one for the show depending on the venue
• Drink
• Bus my ass an hour and a fuckin half out to Toronto with /u/Raging_Elephant 
• Walk to the venue 
• Smoke weed
• Arrive at venue 
• Party 
• Wait for the ride we bummed to pick our useless asses up 
If I'm going to shows with friends it usually involves us all meeting up, driving out to the venue, while I get progressively drunker on the way there. Then smoke a bit before the show, and go in. If it's a city we haven't been to or festival we'll sometimes plan a small trip around it, go check out what the city has to offer and stuff. 

I also have a weird superstitious ritual before I play any shows where during the day I sit around and listen to the entirety of Sleep's Dopesmoker, sip on some rum and have my dad make me fried chicken. The one time I did not do this before a gig resulted in catastrophic results
I'm the same as you. I live in geelong, so I have to drive up. I wait until it's time to actually go though, cos fuck forking over tens of dollars for parking. Don't wanna train either, cos I'm always paranoid the show will get out after the trains stop and I'll be stranded. 
Drink a beer catch a train in and go to the show.
I always try to be early for gigs, that way I get to pick out the best stuff first at the merch table (especially for shirts as mediums tend to get sold out quickly).

If I'm in another country, some research on how to get to the venue and scouting around if possible, the day before. 

Before I leave, check if I brought my earplugs. Since I started using them a couple of years ago, it's improved the sound experience a lot - I don't just hear an incoherent jumbled mess anymore, and I protect my hearing. The Alpine Musicsafe Classics are my go-to, highly recommended.

Stretch, otherwise I get a bad neck for like a week
Couple Jim Beam and cokes in Spoons with friend then smoke biggest spliff I can manage outside venue.
I usually drive and sing. After that I usually convince my friend to join me for the gig, and then we might soak ourselves in alcohol.
Have a good meal. If it's a big concert with overpriced beer, get a bit drunk.
Grab my vest, put on a bandshirt and my other clothes.

Check several times if I have the ticket (dont wanna drive the whole way back), pick up my friends (most of the time I am the driver, because I dont drink alcohol. I am fine with this). Sometimes eat something.


We have a post-gig ritual for a certain venue, that we also go to eat at a Subway Store at the venue after the gig.
lots of weed and don't listen to the band you going to see
Grab my vest.

Make sure I have my ticket a million times.

Get on the train.

Avoid eating too close or too much before the show so I don't barf in the pit.

Mosh my brains out.

Get McDonalds afterwards.

Ride the train covered in sweat and beer.

Get home, shower, and sleep like a king.
Checking to make sure that I have everything at least 34958 times because I know I'm going to forget something anyways.
- Don't listen to any music the day of the show so I don't get burnt out

- Eat a big meal usually from a buthe place near my house or sometimes a sub place near the venue

- Get on the train and go to the venue

- Go to a liquor store near the venue and get two or three mini liquor bottles. 

- Chug two and put the third in my pocket for later

- Go to the venue and get a drink to keep my buzz until the bands start.
It's been a while but we'd usually slam a bottle of jagermeister in the parking lot before we went in.
I haven't played a show in a few years, but I would usually get to the venue at load in. I would get to know the venue and have it mapped out like the back of my hand. Then I would look at the list of bands that have played there before. Then I would do sound check. Then I would go out back and chain smoke and listen to really mellow calming music for 30 minutes before the show. The moment of calm before the blank "autopilot" feeling that is playing a show makes it that much more therapeutic. 
I always drink coffee two hours before I leave for the gig, because by that time I'll have already pooped and will be free and clear for the night.
* Listen to ambient or neo-classical to relax.
* Roll five or six joints.
* Equip boots, bullets, studs, kutte and Oakley shades.
* Put four beers in my kutte before leaving the house.
* Walk three blocks to the train, finishing a beer on the way.
* Drink two more on the 30 minute ride.
* Walk to venue from station, drinking last beer.
* Get to venue, spark a joint and wait for people to show up
* If no one has showed up by that time, I go in, get a beer and find a quiet, dark spot to sit and wait.
Most times my friends come to my office. We remove our ties and I'll let my secretary order some Vietnamese food. I remove my watch and put on my spike bracelet. We eat and listen to some jazz (probably Coltrane, Bird). We check and discuss the stock market closings while my secretary orders a cab. Then we start to drink.

We get in the cab, we get out of the cab, we make fun of the emo's, they look envious as we pass by.

Then everything will go black and next morning (I hope) I will wake up somewhere (hotelroom, museum bathroom, on a table in McDonalds) with a couple of chicks. I freshen up and we go for a stroll through the park or visit a gallery.

Not every night though. Mostly on fridays.
I'm 47 so it's a little different pregame than when I started.

* Get off work / take quick nap.
* Take 4 ibuprofen with a Americano = not as sore the next day.
* Drive to show
* Smoke or edibles if available, if not a couple of Black Russians.
* Put in ear plugs.
Pretty much just drive an hour to Toronto (the rare time pick up a buddy who is also coming, but that's rare because my friends don't dig metal), park as close to the venue as I think possible, walk rest of way...passing a closer parking lot. 

Get inside, grab a beer, check merch table. Enjoy show. 
I'm also an hour train ride from Melbourne. We usually get into the city early, hit up a pub or two then walk to the venue since Melbourne is a really nice city to just wonder around in.
Drink beer

Put on deodorant

Go to show

Drink more beer
It's a grey rainy day here and this song has been stuck in my head all day. The whole album is definitely worth checking out as well as the split they released with Panopticon this year
Good ol' métal français. 
Fuck Tony Abbott  
Heavily underrated band and album. Love it.
[deleted]
Oh shit, hype is flowing over here.
I played that cassette to death back in the day. 
Had no idea they put out a new album. I liked the last one well enough despite normally avoiding this type of thing like the plague- gonna have to try it out. 
Stellar album. Oi Magoi is one of my favorites, this is a damn good addition to the catalog.
Woah, this is sweet.  Gonna check this out when it's within budget.
Just giving this album a first listen, liking what I hear so far.. will have to go back and check out the others.
Great album, easily as good as the first two. Shame the mastering is crushed to hell, but it's to be expected. 
> Exumer is nonetheless an essential part of Euro thrash history

Hobbs is finally on Spotify! Found one of these guys albums years ago but never could find anything else from them. There well worth a listen if your into distinct vocals.
weird name, was skeptical but this is some good shit.
interesting question. it takes me only 1-2 minutes to read a review, but up to 5-6 minutes to listen to one song or 30+ for an album that may have a few stinkers hiding the gems. i think it still has a place, especially when there's so much underground stuff that you just don't have the time to listen to all of it
"... and can be incredibly entertaining to read"

Isn't that your answer right there? + critics can give a perspective on music that can help readers appreciate music more. It definitely has a place, in my opinion.
Apart from the role of critic as tastemaker or curator or adviser or scout (each of which *might* be threatened by listeners' ability to simply hear the music for themselves directly over the internet), a good critic can direct a reader's attention, and that's irreplaceable.  When a critic says "x, y, and z are the interesting parts of this artwork, for reasons p, q, and r"—that's the output of an educated aesthetic sense.  Such claims are particularly valuable to neophytes, who don't necessarily know what to look for in appreciating an artwork, but they're also interesting and valuable to a seasoned audience, who can then engage with the critic's judgments.
This is a valid question to other cultural realms as well. Jessa Crispin, a book critic, touches the subject on [this essay](http://copper-nickel.org/the-self-hating-book-critic/), where she states and I find it very true:

> *I am trying to remember what dragged me into this role to begin with. Books had served me, I wanted to serve them back. It must have been as simple as that.*
Yes, technology can make criticism obsolete. Computers can compare playlists and tell that two person share the same tastes. From this, one can build a personalized recommendation system.
What's the future of the critics then? Perhaps "tagging", because those systems work better if things are correctly tagged.
As the current Top 40 chart as my evidence: no. Music criticism is not obsolete.
Kim Kelly's favorite band
Fuckin' figures everyone losing their minds over the Eternal Champion album decided to sit this one out. 

Graven Rite were the better band of the two until the new EC album, ya dinguses.
SUCH A GOOD DEMO
Three dollars on Bandcamp? This is definitely worth way more than that. So good.
Great song. While not entirely same genre, reminds me of ColdWorld and Austere.
wtf was that
Best album imho.

Too bad there's no vinyl version of Banquet, just Anatomy and Instinct.
Great band, the title track to this album is a favorite of mine.
Holy shit, that song title is incredible.
Yeaaah. One of my fav less known bands. The leads are so good.
Come on...this isn't brutal death...right...RIGHT
Amazing band. A pity they quit.
I wish those Disturbed songs that I haven't listened to for like three or two years would leave my head
Last night we watched Kung Fury and I feel like it's been made just for me, it's everything I love

I even love David Hasselhoff now
If tomato sauce ruins the seasoning of your cast iron, then ***YOUR SEASONING WAS WEAK AS FUCK AND IS A THING TO BE MOCKED! MOCKED! COOK SOME FUCKING SHAKSHUKA IN YOUR GLORIOUS IRON WORKHORSE YOU FUCKING FUCK!***

I swear the UK is intent on turning itself into a Orwellian superstate. [The Government has just passed what's commonly known as the Snoopers' Charter](http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2477546/snoopers-charter-20-ip-bill-passed-by-parliament-and-will-become-law-within-weeks): 

> The law will require internet and phone companies to store comprehensive records of websites visited and phone numbers called for 12 months, and to enable police, security services and multiple other public sector bodies to access those records on demand.

> It will also provide the security services with the legal power to bulk collect personal communications data, and give police and security services the explicit power to hack into, and bug, computers and smartphones. These powers will largely require only the approval of the home secretary.

What's upsetting is that practically no-one blinked an eye. In the wake of Brexit everyone's mind is obviously elsewhere, but it's a travesty that the media barely reported this. *Bloody Fucking Hell*, Britain, get your mind out the gutter and set yourself straight. 
Is anyone picking up the new Pokemon tomorrow? If so FUCK YOU IT DOESN'T COME OUT OVER HERE FOR ANOTHER WEEK FUCK SAKE NINTENDO 
Anyone else suffer from Tinnitus? 

Had it in my left ear for about a year now after a stubborn infection (not due to loud metal).  Some black metal and thrash seems to hit the right frequencies to drown it out, others not so much... power metal seems to make it worse!
So my truck was totalled last night. Sitting at a red light and some asshole looking at his phone slammed into the back of my truck. It was my only vehicle and my livelihood. I work out of the back of my truck. Everyone was fine, no injuries but now I'm stuck with nothing to drive and no way to do work. I was contacted by a lawyer last night after the accident and he wants me to go to the ER and get checked out. I have never been in an accident like this.
The guy who hit me has insurance. I've got some people telling me to use the lawyer and others saying not to. I have no idea what to do. I just want a truck so I can go back to work. This shit sucks. 
#My Notes on Western Esotericism 

Even though my wife isn't saying anything I know she is unnerved by some of the books I am reading that have the worlds "Occult" on the front with pentagrams and all seeing eyes. We were at a book store and I brought her a book on the symbology of the Tarot and she looked at me like I was going to bring an evil spirit home with us. I do not know why this stuff fascinated me when most of the major religions have just as fantastic and mystic properties as some of the fringe beliefs.  From what I am understanding a lot of what is listed below was proto-christianity, first drafts of major religions, or just splinter groups from major beliefs. It is just fascinating to me that we can think of one belief system as true, others as not true but understandable, and others as fucking crazy. What seems to separate the things below is the belief of secret knowledge as well as the use of symbols.    

So here I am still making my way through a range of topics that seem to fit unsorted in a drain basin at the bottom of religion, science, philosophy, mythology, and straight up conspiracy theory. If /u/raoulduke25 or /u/padsboltssaints15 has anything to add or correct me in my understanding with some of these topics, I would be happy to listen and talk with a cup of coffee in some shed int he woods. 

----

**What I think I know** -- and I am sure I am wrong about most things. 

-----

**The Occult** - An umbrella term for esoteric philosophy with a shared belief of secret and hidden knowledge. Includes things ranging from Magic, Alchemy, Spiritualism, Mysticism, Divination, and any other philosophy that has a secretive or hidden truth for believers. 

**Gnosticism** - A proto / splinter Christian philosophy where by the world was created by a false god and existence is a horrid simulacrum of the true way of thinking. Christ was given to the world as sort of a treasure map for followers to eventually realize the truth and escape the false existence.  

**Alchemy** A mixture of proto-science / philosophy / mysticism which was one of the front runners for technological development in an age where that thing wasn't really supported. Involved the transmutation of elements but also involved the transmutation of the soul from lesser states to pure states. Now is used as a placeholder for mystic sciences and making health potions. 

**Kabbalah** - ???? / Jewish mysticism?

**Hermeticism** - ???? / I should really figure this one out since this name appears over everything I read. 

**Freemasonry** - an ancient order of thinkers / builders that used mysticism and intrigue to spread their prestige thought but is now just a fraternity of people who love the idea of being apart of a secret order that probably does nothing more than eat dinner once a month. 

**The Illuminati** - See Freemasonry above but even less of an organization. Now more a meme than anything substantial. 

**Rosicrucianism** - ????? / Mystic Christianity with some weird looking [cross](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Rose_Cross_Lamen.svg) that would probably give my father a heart attack if he saw I was reading about it. 

**Magic** - ???? I have seen it referenced and people been referenced as magicians but I do not know what this means. From what I understand it could mean a leader of an esoteric philosophy or practitioner of ritual magic. 

**Divination** - The practice of making predictions about the future using material objects. Tarot, augury, scrying all fit into here. I listened to a conspiracy podcast (don't ask) and an idea was raised about how companies use big data from your browsing history as a form of divination to commercial habits. 

----

Books I am reading or have read: 

[Season of the Witch: How the Occult Saved Rock and Roll](http://pitchfork.com/features/paper-trail/9533-season-of-the-witch-how-the-occult-saved-rock-and-roll/) - Interesting book on the occults influence on 20th century rock music. Not to terribly in depth for anyone who knows some of the more famous stories of Led Zeppelin, Ozzy Osbourne, Mick Jagger, and David Bowie. 

[Occult America](https://www.amazon.com/Occult-America-Seances-Circles-History/dp/0553385151) - A really cool and also focused view on mysticism in the foundations of American history. Western esoterisimc is huge with the Dark Ages, rEnaissance, Enlightenment but this books starts in the 1700's and works its way slowly though the centuries examining the foundations of spiritualism, Mormonism, The Shakers, and all manner of christian sects that mixed with esoteric philosophy. 

--------

**EDIT:** I think it is hilarious to mention that it was heavy metal's use of occult images that led me to investigate the  meaning behind them. I guess my youth group pastor was right. 
I think I'm starting to develop some serious anxiety disorder, and I'm not really sure what to do or where to look. I just feel on edge all the time, like there's always someone watching me or that I'm always doing something gravely wrong, and I can't shake it and its really starting to have a visible effect on me. I just feel really lost right now, and I'm not even particularly sure why I'm writing this.

Oh, and Dishonored 2 is fun
Well, I'm here early. Who saw Arrival? I liked it a lot. 
I'm new to this so i'm assuming the "Off-Topic" Discussion is here right?


Ever way i have a question


Is pirating music ever justified?



A friend of mine recently bought some of the latest magic cards to build a 60 card deck so we can play a format other than EDH. I'm particularly happy because I usually win against him in casual.

Same friend DMed a session of 5e for me and my roommate where we each make two level 2 characters, a gladiator and a backup. The gladiator characters fight to the death and whoever wins levels up to three while the other person has to play their backup. My character was a cleric/ranger multiclass and beat the other gladiator, who was a warlock/cleric multiclass.
I applied to be a metal columnist for a somewhat well known punk magazine. Wish me luck!
Who else works in a corporate type job? I feel like I will never fit in here even though I try to make conversation with my coworkers bout stuff they like. I'm probably even more versed on our sports than they are. But I still feel a divide. It doesn't help that they are all rather well off, and I came from a poor family, have a ton of student loan debt, and my salary is not that great. And the younger people here don't really talk to me either because I'm teetotal, and that's all they ever ask me about.


I just tried to message panopticon to ask if the vinyl version of autumn eternal would ever be back in stock and it gave me [this](http://i.imgur.com/80zqGid.jpg) email adress.
What is your favourite classic rock band, and your favourite album of theirs?
So, picked up a side job doing deliveries for Postmates. Cut my hand pretty badly last month, and the bill for the stitches is about $900. Interviewing for a promotion at work today, and put out some feelers at other companies as well.

Outside of that, I'm putting out a new record tomorrow, and a friend of mine is working on a video mix tape with me. Anyone watch those? Stuff like the Crazy Dave tapes, Retard-O-Tron, and Psychadelic Hell Trip? We're just collecting weird video clips now, but it's been fun so far.
I finished the Metallica reviews, Kap. Can you unchain me now?
New Ghost In The Shell trailer disgusts me. Any complaints of whitewashing aside, it looks terrible and completely misses the point of GitS. I could talk for hours about what makes it look awful, so I'll just leave it at that.
Any one into Post-Rock/Metal??

I can honestly say that the new If These Trees Could Talk [Album](https://play.spotify.com/album/1Lodl6h6XvqagHDC1bnsC8) is an album of the year candidate i sugest to give it a try.
Also the new Cult of Luna/Julie Christmas colaboration, [Mariner](https://play.spotify.com/album/7Gys3aNZTqk5o0bXqcMZwv), is a great candidate too.

But i still have more material to listen to, for example, i haven't had the time to listen the new Mouth of the Architect [Album](https://play.spotify.com/album/2JCvG0P6eb3ND17YCEFhLq), and i've read good stuff about it.
I suddenly realized that years of child abuse has rendered me completely incapable of developing close emotional relationships with others and I feel the only way would be to take substances that completely put me in a disassociative state.

Upon realizing this I'm now unable to have the balls to take drugs to reach this state and just avoid people in general.

I'm super lonely and want to die :)
Anyome recommend a good fiction book series? Ive fallen out of reading recently as I haven't found a series to get into lately. I'll read pretty much anything, but supernatural/fantasy elements are my probably a favorite for me. I like getting into a series because they tend to be more fleshed out. 
What's your favorite 90's or 00's all-girl-Japanese-garage-rock-band?  Everyone's got one, right?

Have any Americans here tried tracing their European heritage, or otherwise. Were you successful, or did it end with the first relative being alive when the US government started keeping track of our citizens.
The Grand Tour will start soon. And it won't be available in my region until December. :-(
I'm up to the last two chapters of The Return Of The King and I'm starting to look forward to my next book. I impulse bought The Oath Breaker by Alaric Longward for obvious reasons. It's part of a very long series with splintering and completely separate paths through the series. I've kept myself in the dark about it as much as possible and I'm genuinely excited to start.

Has anyone read it or anything else by him? As a recently new fan of Bernard Cornwell do you think it won't disappoint? 
I ordered my first cassette last night: Cloak and Daggere - Dith Chealtair. This is pretty exciting but I really feel like a hipster now.


Fellow college students, how do you stay focused while studying and not get sidetracked by games/reddit/etc? 
What are your favorite music related podcasts? or something related to metal in general.
I'm getting real sick of looking for a new job. The positions either get filled, or I just don't hear back. Two and a half months now and I've only gotten maybe 3 calls and 3 emails back.
Finished my Wheel of Time reread, and reading the Sandman Slim series up until the last book. Nasty cliffhanger, damn.

Also finished the Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple! rewatch with my girlfriend. Just have the OVA left, and then I'll have an empty, Kenichi-size hole in my heart. Maybe I'll read the manga.

I tried Ritalin for the first time last weekend. It's the first time I've ever had a non-prescribed/non-OTC drug in my life (including alcohol, excluding caffeine if you count that). I really enjoyed the way I felt on it, it made me feel more focused and honestly made me feel happier than normal. I'm not going to do it again because I could definitely see myself becoming dependent on it, but it has made me want to see a psychiatrist more to get evaluated for depression.
I was sitting in Taco Bell on my lunch break  (btw the steakhouse burrito is 100% worth the price) and I started to think how beautifully fake taco meat and metal go together.  Is this just me? I feel like it's probably not

My PC just started acting up by giving my the finger in the form of multiple blue screens. At this stage I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it doesn't crash in a similar fashion to less than a year ago.
I'm sure many of you have seen this already - but the Ned Flander's themed band Howdilly Doodilly released their debut album [Okilly Dokilly](https://okillydokilly.bandcamp.com/album/howdilly-doodilly) last week.

As a long time Simpsons fan, I gave it a few listens. Next thing I know, half the album is stuck in my head and I've booked tickets to see them support Mac Sabbath and Metallachi in LA next year. 

I appreciate that the music really isn't for everyone, but I don't understand all the hate they get online. I think it's super creative, I really enjoy their take on the theme/genre and I want to support them (mostly so they can get even better Ned costumes).

Anyone else enjoy this album? Also interested to hear what people think of Mac Sabbath.

EDIT: My favorite track is Godspeed Little Doodle, check it out if you haven't heard them yet.
Do you think it will be easier or harder for black metal bands to get a visa now that Trump will be president? 
Steel cut oats and a cup of Earl Grey are my favorite thing about mornings. 
I've started using an old skateboard to get around campus, but after an afternoon of pushing around campus my foot gets REALLY sore (like pit all your weight on the other foot). I don't think I'm pushing wrong but any suggestions?
So I just decided I'm not going to be looking at MetalSucks anymore. I liked to go and see if there was anything interesting every now and then, but I just can't do it anymore. Can anyone recommend a good metal news site that isn't written by giant vaginas?
I recently got into Animals as leaders and was completely blown away especially by "The joy of motion". i love jazz and prog so TJOM was almost too good to be true . Could you guys suggest any similar artists/albums?
Good metal memoirs? I loved Iommi's book, tons of fascinating stories and insight into Black Sabbath. I see Mustaine has a memoir I'm thinking of getting, any other recommendations?

Some good picks, some questionable omissions, and a few albums that - in my view - ranked a lot higher than they deserved. Nails' album is good, but it's not *that* good. Glad to see Gorguts ranked well, Pleiades' Dust is a masterpiece. Chthe'ilist, Phobocosm, Subrosa all good picks on that list. 

A few albums off the top of my head I think really ought to have at least ranked though:

Zhrine - Unortheta

Ulcerate - Shrines of Paralysis

Wormrot - Voices
Glad no one is complaining about Inter Arma's *Paradise Gallows* being on there...that shit is crushing
I used to only get my metal info from Decibel, so it's weird seeing their picks compared to what are generally considered the best metal albums of the year by r/metal and myself, now that I don't get my info from them at all. 

And does Decibel not know who Vektor is? WHAT THE FUCK?
There were some good picks in there, but I'm really surprised none of them included Ripper's "Experiment of Existence".
Sweet, figured I wasn't going to be able to complain about publications I don't read making lists that differ more than 5% from my own before Black Friday.
Good list, straight to the point rather than having to click "next" for 1 album per web page.
It's not even December...

Anyways, decent mix of good, mediocre and fucking awful stuff, as I'd expect from them.
I'm happy to see Blood Incantation in the top three, I really love the style of death metal on that album.

Nails I'm scratching my head at. Nails is good, but that album isn't the best thing they've done, nor do they deserve such a high spot. But whatever.

Still haven't listened to the Khemmis, I think I somewhat enjoyed the last one so I guess I'll check it out.

Overall, nothing in the top 10 really aligns with me beyond Blood Incantation.
Stoked to see Trap Them's Crown Feral on there! Honestly one of my favorite albums this year. 
Happy to see Crowbar on there, but that's the only album I know (yeah, I don't know shit about shit, shut up). I kind of want to make it a point to listen to all of these now.
A (mostly) complete Spotify playlist: [Decibel's Top 40 of 2016](https://open.spotify.com/user/svenmidnite/playlist/5sbAnn0CMyMbxZ0cLwAz3k)
Glad Khemmis is up there, probably my favorite of the year.
no Ihsahn???????
Wow I barely recognize any of them other than the black metal ones. I need to listen to other genres.
I mean, I like Nails, but this is ridiculous.
I think some stuff should be a lot higher, and others a lot lower, but otherwise it's a solid list. Can't disagree Khemmis being number 1 seeing as it's my number 2. Abbath has absolutely no business being in the top 10 though.
> No Embalmer. 

Where is the phone so I can cancel my subscription!
Good to see Virus album on there - was fucking solid.
Don't think we will see an Allegaeon on this list.
Definitely some albums on the list that will wind up on my top 10, but the order is quite out of whack for me... For instance the Nails album was good, but it wouldn't even scratch my top 30 for the year probably.
Khemmis at no. 1 is whack. I appreciate wanting to push smaller bands, but seriously????

Nails, Blood Incantation and Oranssi are all solid choices though and all ranked near the top 5 in my list. Having Abbath at 5 is crazy, that album is so dull. 

Surprised by no mention of The Body. I loved No One Deserves Happiness and I thought they were critical darlings at the moment. Also, Vektor, obviously. 
here's the ones I know:

Inverloch - only gave this one one spin, didn't do too much for me but maybe with more listens it'll grow on me.

Inquisition - I liked this one, good riffs, vocals took a while to get used to. Could have used more lead guitar.

Cult of Luna & Julie Christmas - Really outside my comfort zone but not bad, something about her angsty screams i like.

Chthe'ilist - I didn't really like this one, a bit too chaotic and crazy for my liking. Not enough hooks or discernible melody.

Testament - Good album, glad its here.

Wretch - Also glad to see this here, good traditional doom.

Meshuggah - I did not like this album, vocals stood out like a sore thumb to me. I like the technicality but I like more hooks.

Cobalt - I've given this one spin and I remember hating it mostly because of the vocals. I'm seeing praise in the comments so maybe I'll give it another chance.

Gorguts - Only listened to this once but I remember it being good.

Abbath - I really liked this album. Seems a lot of people in shreddit find it too plain, but I like the traditional approach. Good black'n'roll stomping rhythm and solos. Reminded me of Motorhead for some reason.

Nails - The heaviness is shocking, but not something I really want to listen to again.

That's it. Seems I've got a lot to catch up on, feels like all i do is listen to new metal too. There was a bunch of albums I loved that I didn't see here but I'll leave listing them til a future post.

edit: spelling

Decibel, I think you need to.....Review Your Choices

Could have been better.  Could have been worse.  No Sumerlands so GTFO 
This is shit. No Ulcerate?  GET FUCKED
Dark Tranquility?! Kvelertak?!
Missing from this list:

Unfathomable Ruination, Brutally Deceased, Fleshgod Apocalypse, Abnormality, Vader, Witherscape, Hyperion, Mistur, Heaven Shall Burn, and Amon Amarth. 

I suppose Vector should be included in a top 40 list, even if I didn't care for the album.
I'm surprised I disagree with this list as much as I do. Usually Decibel seems to have a slightly better list than most other publications. I can only imagine how bad those are gonna be. Also the only list that Bolzer album should be on is most obvious disappointments of the last decade.
lol
Clicked on this without seeing the FFO and then switched tab. Damn this is sweet and of course I'd have expected it to be had I seen the FFO first.

I was super confused when I clicked on it though, thinking the thumbnail was the album cover and seeing it tagged Trad.
Much better than the other, later crappy Swedish band called the same thing. 
just discovered this band few weeks ago, awesome! 
> High energy

Props for referencing the one Trump meme I actually like. The music is pretty good as well, so have an upvote.
Apparently Arizmenda and Volahn both came through my city last month, and I had no idea. I'm still bummed that I missed them.
Just bought this one a couple of weeks ago.  Great album.
There's another band called Rust but they're from Sweden and are more current, and they sound just like Darkthrone 
I'm surprised these are _actual videos_. Creative shit. Like them or not... Confusion and Dream No More are more "videos" than the ones for Hardwire, Moth into Flame, and Atlas Rise which were basically.... well... the band playing.
Dream no more sounds like what Load and Reload should have sounded like
Read this as

> MEGADETH: The New Metallica Videos

and was really confused for a second or two.
Can I finally say I like Metallica in a thread related to Metallica without getting angry responses?
> JAMES: Okay, guys, I've got the name for this one.  Are you ready?

Heres my quick track by Track

Hardwired:
Decent thrash song. Lyrics are kinda cheesy but damn if they arent kinda relevant.

Moth Into Flame:
Love the riffs in this one. Lyrics are good too. 

Man UNkind
Intro is awesome. Love how it gets heavy pretty quick. It quicly loses it's momentum with a very reload-ish groove. I like the vocals on the interlude but id say this is the weakest track on the album

Confusion:
Has a monster main riff. Not entirely sold on Hetfields singing on this one. I think this is his weakest track vocal wise. But I love the main riff.

Here Comes Revenge: Another song with a monster main riff. Lars does a good job on this one. 

Now That Were Dead:  I like it. It's pretty good hard rock but nothing remarkable. Lyrics are cheesy though and I can't help but hear Shawn Michael's WWF entrance music when the song comes on. 

Murder One: I love this one. Great tribute to Lemmy. 

Am I Savage: Another mediocre track but I do really like parts of it. The pre chorus sounds like Megadeth which is funny but my favorite part is that heavy as fuck chuggy riff in the middle. It's dirty as fuck. 

Atlas Rise: A bit disjointed but god I love the Iron Maiden style harmonies on this one. 

Dream No More: Fucking great. Getting a huge Sabbath/Doom Alice in Chains vibe. Cthulhu theme is always welcome in my book. "You Turn. To Stone!" Lyrics are very catchy.  

Halo On Fire: I think this is my favorite on the album. Great lyrics, great atmosphere, amazing singing. and that ending part is cool as fuck. it's "New Metallica" at it's best. 

Spit Out the Bone: Good shit. Probably tied with Halo on Fire as my favorite. Love the bass solo. 

Lords of Summer: I dont really count this as part of the album since it's a B-Side but it's pretty "meh" It sounds 10 times better than the version they released a few years back though. 

None of the music videos really impressed me except for Dream No More. 

I thought this would be bursting by now but it seems they've all gone back to their hidey holes.
Late to the party, just noticed this thread today. 

Damn, I'm actually pretty impressed. This is the first time since maybe Puppets that they aren't sounding like they have something to prove.

**Justice:** "We can still be heavy _and_ complex without Cliff!"

**Black:** "We're gonna be the next AC/DC, arenas will play us the world over!"

**Load:** "We're classy, not _just another_ thrash metal band.

**Reload:** "I don't think you heard us the first time, I said 'We're classy dammit!!!!'"

**St. Anger:** "Look, we're back and angry and heavy and we still got that young aggression! Totally not a mid-life crisis, serious guys."

**Death Magnetic:** "See, we can still do thrash! We haven't lost it in our age, we got this, look guys, we're loud! It's clipping, that means it's _METAL!_"

This one finally feels like they said "Ah fuck it, let's just have fun and write some music and tour." There's little bits and pieces of every album represented on here. I'm happy. I like this. It's not gonna be album of the year or anything, but I feel like they're actually back for real as their honest selves.
> Dream No More

Damn, James looking classy. Like he's going for a job interview or something.
[Spit Out The Bone is here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m46Z0-HXySo)

What a tune to end the album.
I'm only disappointed that they didn't write a  song titled *The UnFOURgiven*. Really a missed opportunity there. 
ITT: Pure salt. 
I love metallica and defend even some of their shittier work but god damn is their visual art direction a fucking piece of shit. 

Visuals that Metallica has done that were cool: 

Original logo.

One video.

Load cover. 

Parts of the movie. 

Handlebar mustache.

Fight me IRL
ManUNkind.  What the fucking fuck.
[Spit out the Bone](https://youtu.be/m46Z0-HXySo) is here /u/Kaptain_Carbon, and I'll be damned if this isn't the best fucking track on the album. 

Next: [“Here Comes Revenge” \(Directed by Jessica Cope\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpF8Wa2yQH0)

Cartoons woohoo! Err... creepy
Metallica is at a point in their career that they just don't give a fuck, and I mean that in a good way.  they're doing whatever seems fun to them.  And I for one and in it until the end.  Long Live Metallica!
Honestly, I expected something similar to Death Magnetic and that is not what we got. I can see DM sprinkled here and there, but what we have here is a mixture of stuff I don't think we've seen from Metallica, and then some very recognizable influences from their previous albums. 

Hardwired: A catchy and punchy way to start a metal album. Very thrashy, short and just a nice treat. It's very sugar-coated of course, with cheesy lyrics, but it'll easily be the most mainstream track. The fortunate part of it being mainstream is that it isn't terrible.

Atlas, Rise!: The riff and tone is definitely very Death Magnetic. It feels a little bit like they were hoping to go in a jock jam/powerful live track and that's what they got. Otherwise it's just a nice listen but not much more. 

Now That We're Dead: This song's got a nice groove to it, but it had to grow on me. Lyrics are pretty trash, but Rob's on point. 

Moth Into Flame: The intro is pretty awesome, honestly. The chugging riff is thrashy. The interlude into the chorus is like "flying high" as James tells you. Imagery through the music is there. Reminds me a lot of Death Magnetic mixed with St. Anger. Aggression and a thrashy tone but with some improved sound. I was instantly in love with this song even with it being slightly generic, I feel like it's one song that will get people hooked to the album where they'll find some of the better tracks. 

Dream No More: A heavy track but coming off of the quick tempo of the previous four tracks it feels off. It's a great song nonetheless, I feel like Sabbath could've written this, I'm heavily reminded of some of their earlier tracks (The Devil You Know as well, actually). Cthulhu as a subject for the song just makes this song cool. 

Halo on Fire: This has to be one of the best tracks on the album. I can see the Death Magnetic influence, but it has influences from older tracks too, which is great. James' singing is actually good on this song. The interlude halfway through the song is classic Metallica, it's exactly what I was hoping to see them do...it builds and surprises you with how it doesn't just drop off into crap like you'd expect from modern Metallica. 

Confusion: The song starts off with this darker, more disturbing tone to indicate that James decided to sing about some sort of dark, uncomfortable subject. The video was about PTSD so I imagine that's the feel they were going for considering the song builds in a way that is (what I imagine) is reminiscent of having the disorder. Lyrics are pretty decent, bits of it remind me of why the lyrics of Master of Puppets were so good. The singing itself was pretty lax though, it doesn't have the aggression that I'd expect of someone wanting to rid themselves of the pain. James makes it sound like they've given into the pain and are begging for it to be taken from them. 

ManUNkind: This is the obvious stand-out track for being the worst song on the album. It starts off cool and has that nice evil tone that they were going for, but it just falls apart and bored me to death halfway through. Like how do you start with this amazing intro and just trail off into nothingness? It just felt incomplete, like they wrote it in the same way they wrote some of the lesser St. Anger tracks. In reality, it's very much like that, it sounds like St. Anger tracks in the way they just cobbled together some different cooler sounding things that didn't work together. 

Here Comes Revenge: I really like that horror/evil feel I get from this track. The video was about a serial killer wolfman or something, but that's kind of what I'm feeling in this track. It feels like someone who's just gone off the deep end and turns to evil and murder. I believe it's more of speaking as if revenge is a physical thing, but it's so evil like an 80s horror film. I can hear some influence from Death Magnetic, but it's drown out by the quality of the track. And that interlude before the solo though!

Am I Savage?: I thought I had started up some sort of Iron Maiden track at first. Then I was like, is this Megadeth? Then it has this sweet groove of a riff. Then James starts singing and I feel like I'm listening to St. Anger again. It's better than that at least, but it's got so many different styles going on at one time. It sounds cool, but I'm not 100% on if it's working together or just a bunch of cool sounds. 

Murder One: Chuggy chuggy riff here. It's aggressive and fun, just like Lemmy. Then it hits that main riff and you feel right at home. Can't say the singing is super great, but it's a great little tribute to the greatness of Lemmy. 

Spit Out The Bone: Despite having the wackiest video I've seen this side of late 1990s children's shows (I felt like I was watching a Power Rangers style video), the song is definitely a stand-out. It starts out hard and fast and just doesn't stop. I haven't seen a track like that since the first two albums. The intro could've been ripped straight from leftover Kill 'Em All notes. The lyrics and singing are weird...I mean they match the tone at least, but James must have been talking to Mustaine lately because the subject and style is way more Dave than what Metallica normally does. Maybe that's why it sounds slightly Kill 'Em All? Only thing I can truly complain about is Kirk decided to go nuts on the wah pedal during the solo again. Otherwise it just continues to build into a beautifully heavy metal track worthy of Metallica's name. Oh, and they even included a second guitar solo which is actually really good. 

Lords of Summer: Ever since I heard this song the first time I liked the idea of it. It has great energy and some pretty nice riffs. Now with some refinement and studio quality, it sounds a whole lot better. First thing I noticed is the heavier tone...It could've just been the live recording, but they played with the tone and it's fantastic now. This is definitely made for playing live, it doesn't have a whole lot of substance outside of a live performance, but it would definitely be a fun song to listen to live. Otherwise it's not too special or anything. 

I should note that they decided to include some extra b-sides on the actual album. It's live tracks and three covers, but all three are great. Ronnie Rising is probably my favorite song (maybe besides Tenacious D's track) on the Dio tribute album it came from. When A Blind Man Cries is pretty decent as well. Remember Tomorrow shows just how well Metallica can cover some songs...I love Iron Maiden, they're definitely my favorite band (give their new album a listen as well, it's pretty damn good), and Remember Tomorrow is an often forgotten track that sounds fantastic with Metallica's style. Only complaint is the disjointed intro they added to the beginning, not sure why they decided to do that. 

All in all, I'm impressed with this album. It's been a long time coming and I wasn't disappointed. I wasn't blown away either though...but at this point with Metallica I'm just looking to not be disappointed. 
This is my token comment here before I ignore this thread until next Friday.


I think ManUnkind is the weakest track on the album. (other than the cool intro and the interlude) It's definitely the most "Reload-ish" song on the album.  

Kinda dig the video though. Wish it had a Metallica cameo at the end looking old as fuck and terrified. Would have been pretty funny. 
It was smart for them to do this. The album will always be on YouTube no matter how many shit low quality versions they remove.

Putting out their own high quality version cuts down pirating and gives them the money from advertising and being a YouTube partner. 
I want to start a count of how many times Lars uses a fucking tom (that isn't a floor tom coupled with a snare hit) in any of these songs.

So far, Atlas Rise and Moth impressed me, drums aside. Dream No More was a miss for me
The next one, [Halo on Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbxH5S9_A3M&feature=youtu.be).
Hey at 1:47 in Dream No More, it's Erik "Big Money" Salvia! Wonder if he knows or they just pulled it from the web.

Aaaaaaand post.
spit out the bone is the best metallica song in ages.
I love Sortilege. 
I'm digging the new music, but Lars looks like an old homeless man broke into the studio to play with the kits.
Last one: [“Lords of Summer” \(Directed by Brett Murray\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZswCtNmEg) 
Some decent riffs for sure. Some are actually really great and catchy. 
I fully expect 10 threads to get upvoted to the top of the front page before you can delete them anyway, Kap.

#JOIN ME AS I REVIEW ALL OF THE NEW METALLICA VIDEOS - WAS IT WORTH THE 8 YEAR WAIT!? PROBABLY NOT, BUT I'M DIVING IN ANYWAY!

*Last time on Metallica's Fight For Relevancy....* 

**Hardwired**

* I can't be the only one who noticed that Metallica is still riding [Jason's coattails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgu-3WPYNvM). 

**Moth Into Flame**

* I wonder what their lightbulb budget was. 
* I've been thinking about going full LED in my house. Might be around $160 to replace all the bulbs - but should I get those "vintage" Edison bulbs? I mean the look cool, but I wonder if they are at all worth it for actual lighting needs. Anyone here work at Lowe's? Do you have recommendations? I don't care for soft lighting, and usually go for daylight. So take that into consideration.

**Atlas, Rise!**

* Lars looks he's choking down a [heart attack](https://youtu.be/iYh9Lyvr0P8?t=3m28s).

And now, the new episode of *Metallica's Fight For Relevancy*...

---

**Dream No More**

* I fee like once you start tucking button down shirts in to jeans you've effectively given up on life.
* Holy shit - did no one think to stop James when they were recording vocals?
* This video is actually ~~pretty cool~~ visually engaging. Thank you, Director Guy.
* Seriously, James looks like he just came from a PTA meeting in Cuba.
* What's up with Kirk? Did Robert steal the one undershirt that Kirk wore from 1996 to 2002? Matt Pike isn't using his - couldn't he have borrowed it for 20 minutes?

**Confusion**

* Hey guys, wasn't And Justice For All... cool?
* Hey guys, wasn't The Hurt Locker cool?
* This whole video could have been the slow pouring of coffee while she stares off into the distance and I would have been fine with it.
* I gotta wonder if they wanted to be more adventurous with the material for the video and toned it down. I don't think this is going to have the emotional impact on non-vets that they were hoping for.
* Man, so many kids in Iowa are going to have to have their minds *blown* when they see this.

**ManUNkind**

* That title is enough to keep me from buying this album.
* Really?
* /r/ShitTheFalseSay might need a new banner image.
* They picked one of the lamest tracks to have a video poking fun at Mayhem?
* These Lords of Chaos production videos are pretty underwhelming. 
* That shit solo sticks out like a sore thumb.
* OMG HE'S CUTTING HIMSELF THIS IS HORRIBLE WHAT IS METALLICA DOING HAVEN'T THEY HEARD OF AIDS WHAT KIND OF WEIRD PEOPLE WOULD DO THIS SHIT
* Shoulda had David Cameron catch the pig's head at the end there.
* Final Thoughts : Yes, Metallica, we get it, Lars bought Deathcrush. But what the fuck are you trying to say with this one? You picked Team Euronymous twenty years too late? Dead was your favorite Mayhem singer? What was going through your mind?

**Now That We're Dead**

* Wait, this is debuting on Pitchfork? I'm sure those flannel loving quinoa farmers were working themselves into an anti-Electoral College frenzy to be a part of this. 
* Ha! Look at this riotous description from Pitchfork: "*The clip’s imagery mimics the album’s artwork—the band performs while demonic footage of their faces is projected onto them. Watch it below.*" HOLY SHIT THAT'S GOT ME PUMPED FOR THIS!
* 00:00 - Not hating this riff. I guess they decided to go back and redo mediocre Black Album ripoffs?
* 00:29 - Nevermind.
* 01:00 - ~~Ok, not terrible.~~ GOD DAMNIT I WAS GETTING SUCKED IN BY BLACK ALBUM BLACK MAGIC.
* Can't hate a good old performance video. This is really all Metallica has to do for a video. 
* 02:10 - That's a cool progression ruined by Metallica's utterly bland tone.
* OMG THE LIGHTS TURNED RED - LOOK OUT! UFO!
* I could have watched this entire video in this overhead-red-light style. Great use of the album art. I don't hate the art direction on this album like a lot of other people. This video makes good use of it.
* That pre-solo was new and interesting.
* That solo not so much.
* Hey! AJFA snuck in again! HI JUSTICE!
* That refrain basically sums up modern Metallica. Apathy.
* I just realized that Lars is wearing a different skull cap. This one looks more homeless guy. Cute.
* Final Thoughts - I'm shocked this wasn't the lead single. It's just middle of the road enough to sell in massive numbers to Slipknot edgelords and Basic Dads who headbang softly so as not to irritate their Sciatica.

**Here Comes Revenge**

* Oh god, this is getting difficult.
* That is the most depressed jackal ever.
* Seriously, this album is starting to run together.
* I think I might hang myself before this video is over. None of these videos seem to match the tone of the songs. What the fuck am I subjecting myself to? This isn't fun anymore. I just want it all to end. 
* There's nothing funny to point out. The song was shit and so am I for listening to it.

**Am I Savage?**

* It's 10:18, and my wife is getting pissed. I'm supposed to be watching Shameless and giving her a massage, but instead I'm staring at Kirk Hammet's receding hairline. I'm not hating the direction on this one, I wonder if Lars has a large amount of art utilizing negative space in his collection, though this could be a function of the band funding 8,000 new videos all at one time. I regret ever starting on this, and wonder what will come of my wife and child when I'm gone. I hate myself and I want to die.
* Lars is progressing further into homelessness.
* Solipsism is real, albeit somewhat ridiculous. I will never get over his face when eating that cake.
* Jesus Christ, Kirk is bordering on Kerry King mono-dimensial solo territory.
* There's not much to go on with this one, they seem to be phoning it in by this point.

**Halo On Fire**

* I invited folks from the /r/Metal IRC to help me out with this one. No one would try. Instead they're talking about Eternal Alchemist. My wife has gone to bed, and the dog has run into the other room. The light has gone out of this world, and with coming of every third hour I am reminded that I am alone.
* Thank god Chrome has auto translate. Who the fuck reads German? Sadly Metal Hammer didn't deliver, but the Metallica blog did.
* This intro isn't bad.
* Bruised woman with bruises. Blonde bruised bomber. Is she a victim of spousal abuse? Is she into BMX? Is she into MMA? Let's see!
* STOP SINGING JAMES. STOP IT.
* Oh, that intro is the main riff. Is that it? Repeat that riff over and over until Kirk does a lazy solo?
* Wait - Holy shit. That mini solo was something different. No Wah. It was subdued to the point that it was almost a lead melody.
* Hat Watch - Lars has a baseball cap. Way to switch up it, duder.
* These videos are going on and on and on. Can someone please tell them to cut it down? Can someone tell them not every song needs to be 7 minutes?
* I think I saw Lebron on the bus.
* SHE'S AT THE SHOW! It's gonna go off!
* Pit fighter. Apparently capable of knocking out [Winos](https://s3.amazonaws.com/vice_asset_uploader/files/142188442248.jpg) with a single punch. 
* Of course, her only weakness is another skinny little chick - with black hair!
* God, this fight is almost as boring as Metal Sucks v KK Warslut.
* Kirk's actually killing it on this song. He's not filling space, and really seemed to be feeling this track. Solo 6/10. 
* I'm pretty sure that riff at 06:00 was stolen from [Wyrd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOCmnTJWqok).
* Second solo. Kirk seems to return to form. Shining during a refreshing passage on this otherwise brown album.
* Final Thoughts : This track redeemed this album for me. Somewhat. Kirk seemed energized, so that was cool. Robert is apparently window dressing and incredibly underused in this band. I think I'm going to start a fight club now.

**Murder One**

* I don't know if I can stay up for this.
* I expect that if any band is going to treat Lemmy with respect, it would be Metallica. To a certain extent that's happening, but come on, this song fucking blows.
* I love that it's animated. Sorely needed shot of variety in these videos so far. *Edit* - Yes, I remember that jackal video earlier. I'm sorry that I do.
* Once again, this song is one long monotonous drill to the temple.
* These subtitles are a bit lifeless. Seriously. Like this is some French documentary about trade deals. Fucking boring. 
* I may start a Doomsday cult after this.
* Some of the IRC dudes are chiming in - /u/ProtoChaud "the flash cuts are irritating as hell ", "I like the bass sniper rifle thing tho ", "I'm fuckin sick of the "DID YOU KNOW MOTORHEAD" history tidbits at the bottom "
* Why the fuck are you going to write a song about Lemmy and let it be one of the slowest, most overdrawn tracks on the album? Are we learning nothing about speed?
* Hey! Wendy O! I needed a reason to jerk off before bed.
* Hat Watch - No animated hats were harming in the making of this video. 
* /u/Mob_Justice chimes in "While y'all are stuck listening to that, I'm sitting here listening to Dead Congregation. " None of us care. None of us have the energy to care. None of us want to care. We hate you, Mob. We care about that.
* /u/ProtoChaud asks - "did they only have like, one stock photo of Lemmy's face? it's freaking me out "
* Final Thoughts - Ugh. I appreciate the aesthetics, but just watch *Lemmy* and feel better about yourself. 

---

I can't stay up for the rest. I need to go to bed. And never wake up.

That black metal Metallica logo is pretty sweet
I liked Death Magnetic a lot, and what I've heard of the new album sounds fun. Fuck yeah, Metallica.
[ManUNkind” \(Directed by Jonas Åkerlund\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUVr2xnGIEo) 

Edit: this video: wtf
ManUNkind was like a tribute to Mayhem. I liked it. I still think the song name is kind of dumb though.
Proof that Shreddit is full of jaded assholes. 
BASS!! I can finally hear the bass line! 
Can we talk about how much of a wasted opportunity the video for Am I Savage? Is?

It was a good concept and got halfway there. The actor was capable but damn. The direction was weird. Dude was hugging chairs and shaving with cake stuff. Plus could have fixed the grey suits a bit to not look so dinky.

Also fucking Rob helicoptering out of nowhere actually got me offguard and I laughed.

Another one, [Murder One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Mkq6GFLIsk)
So I've been listening to these as they've come out. Most are pretty solid overall I think. I'll say that the first 3 track they released grew on me over time and I quite enjoy them now. Some of the stuff released over the last 24 hours isn't the best, but the album is still probably their most solid release in decades. a

Spit Out The Bone is probably the standout for me at the moment. That song just cranks, the lyrics aren't bad and I think James probably sounds his best on this track.

I don't think I'm not alone in saying that I straight up hated St. Anger and Death Magnetic. The former was so bad I can't forget it and the later was so bad I can't remember it, but this...this is good and I'm pretty impressed.
waaaayyyyy better then "The Stage"









that one sucked
Hardwired- Very amazing track that goes back to their tradition of starting an album with an insane thrasher. Ex. (Hit the Lights, Fight Fire with Fire, Battery, Blackened, That was Just Your Life). Very strong opener.



Atlas, Rise!- From the three singles, this was the one that took the most time for me to adjust my pallate to. Its not bad at all really, though not my favorite, its not bad. 





Now that Were Dead- The intro is amazing and it has a really good groovy vibe to it. Very good drumwork from Lars. Definately one of the catchiest on the album, although it does drag on for a little more than it should but its a good track nonetheless.





Moth into Flame- My favorite off the album. You can hear the Death Magnetic and even Iron Maiden influences very strong in this song. The chorus is my absolute favorite part of the song, with a very strong message. Easily the best song on the album.





Dream No More- This one is abit more interesting. Its clear that this is pure Load/Reload influenced (think about Fixxxer, The Memory Remains, Outlaw Torn and Unforgiven II when listening to this one). Very groovy and a very interesting Ktulu refference in the chorus. Overall not my favorite track, more like an average track on the record.





Halo on Fire- The classic Metallica quassiballad. In the tradition of having atleast one softie on each Metallica album. (Fade to Black, Welcome Home (Sanitarium), One, Unforgiven, Until it Sleeps, The Day that Never Comes) this one is an incredibly strong track. The "Hello Darkness, Say Goodbye" is one of my favorite parts on the whole album. Incredibly strong track that really showcases everything Metallica is capable of.





Confusion- From the get-go, the "Am I Evil?" intro is notable. Also the drum part after the intro reminds me of "Cyanide". I like the lyrics because they deal with the very real struggles of PTSD. The riffs kinda fall flat on this one though, I was expecting a good bridge riff to seal the deal but we didnt get it. Not a bad track but couldve done better. 





ManUnkind- Every album has it. The throwaway track of the album. This is easily my least favorite song on the whole album, not fealing at all inspired. Also the title is just.....ugh. The video caught me by surprise with a tribute to Black Metal legends Mayhem. Really the only good part of this mess is the intro.





Here Comes Revenge- Ok im just gonna say it. I fucking love this song. The very sinister feel of the song is really amazing. The Bass and drums really bring the song home with Hetfield's vocals. The guitars arent really amazing however but I just love the atmosphere in this song and the video is so unsettling. 





Am I Savage?- When I first heard this one, I thought it was the same song as "Dream No More". Another heavily Load/Reload influenced track. Im starting to notice that groove has been pretty notable throughout the record. I would say this track is average until it goes silent and the very Pantera-like riff comes in before the solo. It actually saves this track from being a throwaway, but still not the best but not entirely terrible.





Murder One- This tribute to the late-great Lemmy Kilmister starts off with a clean riff very similar to "Sanitarium". After that, a very Motorhead-like section comes on. I think this track wouldve fared better if it was an actual Motorhead song with a slightly faster tempo. Overall it didnt really didnt reach my expectations.





Spit out the Bone- Wow. Just fucking wow. Metallica also has had a habit of closing out the album with another thrasher (Metal Militia, Damage Inc., Dyers Eve, My Apocalypse) in an attempt to make a thrash sandwich with a powerful intro and closing song. This is what we all wanted from them since "Justice" and they delivered. Also Cliff is very much alive through Robert Trujillo with that distorted bass solo. Very strong way to end the record.





Lords of Summer- Its a pretty decent track but it generally feels abit unispired and I hate the title. But its not a bad track. The bridge is really awesome but it is abit repetitive.





Best songs- Hardwired, Moth into Flame, Halo on Fire, Here comes Revenge, Spit out the Bone.




Need to listen more- Atlas, Rise!, Dream No More, Am I Savage?, Confusion.




Worst Songs- Murder One, ManUnkind.





Overall, this album is pretty solid. It does suffer from dragging out too long on some parts but theres ALOT of feeling and emotion and atmosphere in some of these songs that just cannot be overlooked. Not quite as crazy or technical as Death Magnetic but that gave way for very good lyrics and songwritting. James Hetfield is definately the strongest factor here both vocally, lyrically and in his guitar work. Its not perfect but its pretty satisfying. 





Im gonna give it a 7.5/10, pushing on 8/10.


Holy fuck Here Comes Revenge's video was creepy as hell
Im not really feelin the video for Confusion. I dig the song (Love the main riff) but the video is kinda boring. Wish they went all out with action and stuff instead of just shots of a random soldier running around an empty warzone with zero gunfire, explosions and all that other super fun war shit. The office scenes had more going on in them for christsake!  Guess they are keeping these videos pretty low budget. 
You know, there's something I just don't understand about Metallica. I see people say things like, "well, it's not like they could go back to their old sound". I mean, why not? 

I'm not saying they should (or even that I'd want them to) but at this point they could have any sound they want. I get why they adopted a more commercially successful sound in the 90's but by now they're all rich as fuck. Surely they're doing this stuff at this point because they love doing it. I listen to their guitar tone and I just don't get why they would choose it. This can't possibly be THE guitar tone right? Kirk still has his (still unpopular?) wah solos so maybe it really is what they prefer. 

Just to reiterate, I'm not saying they should go back to their 30 year old sound. My point is that they could really have any sound they want at this point.

   
[Spit Out The Bone MV just released](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m46Z0-HXySo)

and [here is the article](http://www.nme.com/news/music/metallica-video-spit-out-the-bone-hardwired-new-album-1860368)
Sadly the singles were the best they had to offer it seems. ManUnkind is probably the worst track on the album. At least the video was cool
I dunno its still lacking the oomph that Metallicas first 3 albums had. 

It's decent, much better than load/reload and the production is MILES better than Death Magnetic. I guess I'm just not a fan of the progressive song structures, and I really just can't stand Jame's vocals. I'm glad for him and his sobriety, but those classes straight up ruined his singing. 

My thrash thirst will continue to be filled by bands like GWAR, Ghoul, Vektor, Muncipal Waste, Iron Reagan, BAT, NOISEM, etc.
I can't wait to listen to it. The record store near me is having a listening party for the release tomorrow night. Album art is a bummer, though.
Just finished a listen through. IMHO, of course:

Their best work since the Black album. Some of Kirk's most inspired, if not most technical, guitar work in years. Plenty of wah, but also plenty of no-wah. The songwriting is solid as fuck. I like the long track times.

I would have liked a little less brightness on the snare drum (can't keep Lars the control freak out of the final mix), and to let Rob play more.
I love that "Atlas... RIIIIIIIIIISE!" It's gorgeous. 
I was thinking... Wasn't there a band (not sure if metal or rock) that put out a video for every song on an album? I can't really remember, but I'm pretty sure some band did this a few years ago...
So they've pretty much re-released Load with a couple thrashy songs thrown in.
I just spent a solid 7:24 laughing at the manunkind song and the video. What the fuck???? AHHAHAHAHAHAHah

EVEN BETTER, IT'S PROBABLY THE SLOWEST/LAMEST METALLICA SONG OF ALL TIME


HAHAHAHAHAH
A
HAAAHh

I can't fucking take this anymore


Edit: I'm still giggling about it, and these responds from true metalheads just made me burst out laughing. I didn't know Metallica could bring so much joy to me.
Puh, some ideas sound as if they have found them on the street, on a phone, lost by somebody.

Really chewy.
The videos themselves are all pretty good, I like the old scifi themes and the pokie wifebeater, but the music seems like a collection of B-sides that never made it to their real albums post Load/Reload.

I don't get the rejuvenated excitement people are having, so far I feel like this is just an extension of old-mentallica trying to make music they think people want them to make. 

Uninspired is the word I'd use for it :\
Spit out the bone https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m46Z0-HXySo&ab_channel=MetallicaTV
Fucken hell that drum production is horrible, wtf were they thinking?!

anyone has checked out which of these songs are ballads? Pretty sure they've released at least one ballad per album
Just watched most of the Lords of Chaos video: stylistically, a total mess. I diagnose the song itself as stoner.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO...

I was looking forward for that spam of Metallica videos/threads :(
Metallica these days sounds like they decided to turn their gain up to about 3. I think a lot of their newer songs would sound better than they do if they had some actual distortion to them. The guitars just seem so... flat. I am not saying the songs would be great, but better than they are now. Megadeth's last effort still kills this and Death Magnetic imo. 
Really like the riff on Confusion, the solo is crap and the lyrics are a mixed bag but that riff definitely warrants repeat listening. ManUNkind is one of the worst titles for a song ever, and the song itself is also pretty boring. Dream no more sounds like it's straight off the Black album or Load/Reload, which to me is not a good thing. Now that we're dead is more BA/Load/Reload, decently catchy but there's just nothing special about it, too run of the mill. 

Luckily I really liked the 3 singles. Really looking forward to the Spit out the Bone video. That might the best Metallica song I've heard since the AJFA days. 
it's bad enough they want to crap on their own legacy, on mainstream metal in general.

now they have to crap on underground metal?
This album is fucking fantastic
Sounds almost like Weedeater if they picked up the pace.
Same singer/guitar player from [Scáth Na Déithe](https://scathnadeithe.bandcamp.com/releases). I can't get enough of this guy's vocals. It reminds me of Deliverance-era Mikael Akerfeldt over menacing black metal.
[Metal Underground link](http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=129285)

Trevor Strnad guest vocals on a song, album's going to be fucking awesome.
Terrible band. Hilarious how the venue at Frost and Fire trickled to other areas while they played.
MTL In the house!
This song along 'Mare Nostrum' and 'Legacy of the Snake' has been my favorites from the album. Feels like this was released just yesterday.

Great pick!
LP when?
Also FFO: Thy Catafalque (side note, how do you pronounce this shit? I keep saying thy "cattle " "folk")
I wonder what these guys have been up to. Haven't they been working on a follow up for a while?

Great album, BTW. All of Negura's creativity seemed to leave with them.
###[Master’s Hammer – Rituál](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMviPeHz_Lc) (1991)

What a strange creature you are. An album full of fuzzed out quasi-NWOBHM riffs melded into a whirling black metal abomination. The guitar tone sounds more like it belongs on a trad doom record than on a classic black metal album, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t work. Speaking of the guitars, Storm (chuckle) and Necrocock (hearty chuckle) don’t give two shits (probably not even one, if I had to guess) about sticking to any kind of template in their riffing. They jump back and forth from icy black metal, to soaring twin heavy metal melodies, to speed metal often within the span of the same song. The drums, like the rest of the album, have a zany and unpredictable quality. What totally sold me on this album was the vocals. The howled, despairing vocals sound as if they come from a mentally unstable maniac. The vocals come across as being expressive, emotional, and balls out crazy all at once—never a bad thing. Across the album, I liked what felt like the experimental tinge to a lot of the songs; it never felt quite like straight up black metal. There was always a hint of uneasiness, a twisting, hard to pin down nebulousness that kept me riveted from start to finish. Rituál: like walking through a black metal funhouse. 

###[Ulver – Bergtatt - Et Eeventyr i 5 Capitler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVcjf_p5pDY) (1995)

Another classic you’ve heard all about, but why not hear about it again, from me? I’m mildly ashamed to admit that I had only ever listened to Nattens Madrigal before the advent of this NBBMN. I remember trying this album out a while back before I was into black metal and I couldn’t quite grasp it. Well as our newest Nobel laureate (lol) would say, “The times, they are-a-changing.” And I’ve grown up enough in my black metal listening that, wow, Bergtatt is stunning. Everything about this album is incredibly dynamic. The guitars dance around from beautiful acoustics to razor-sharp riffing with ease. Songs are often interrupted by strange interludes of walking through a field, piano, or straight-up silence. I was a little weirded -out to hear the first song consisting of nothing but clean vocals. A little disappointed, too, but once I heard that other songs featured a beautiful wolf-howl of a screech, I began to enjoy the contrast between the clean and harsh vocals. Those aren’t the only vocals, either: chanting is also featured prominently, so the vocalizing is quite varied. Lyrics are screamed in Norwegian, so for all I know they could be talking about buying a new dishwasher, but I kind of doubt it. I found myself being fascinated by the bass as well. Sometimes it follows along with the guitars, and lays down a warm foundation for them to lie upon, and other times it simply shatters what I thought bass could do in a black metal context. For anyone who hasn’t listened to Capitel III (yes, all eight of you), the bass needs to be heard to be believed. For some reason the first thing that popped into my head to describe the bass was that it is “telling a scary story.” Seriously, it sounds strange, but it makes sense (to me, anyway). The album creates a beautiful atmosphere that I haven’t quite heard in any other band (besides Agalloch, who, OK, took a lot of influence from this album, huh?). A beautiful, panoramic, black metal masterpiece. 

###[Urfaust – Empty Space Meditation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP5sVjdWbys) (2016)

Hey. You want to hear something? Take a seat. Yeah, don’t worry about it, just sit down. Put these headphones on. The lights? No, yeah, just let me draw the shades here. Set the mood, so to speak. Ready? Welcome to Urfaust. Empty Space Meditation starts of very strong. The first Meditatum, a five-and-some-change minute instrumental ambient track is a perfect mood setter for what is in store. Meditatum II I would argue is the high point of the album. Coming off the beautiful ambient chords, the explosion of color, melody, and emotion hit like a sledgehammer. Although, maybe like an incorporeal sledgehammer? The can’t-believe-they’re-not-synth guitars sparkle and shimmer ethereally across the song’s 10-minute running time. The song is quite dynamic, cascading through multiple movements, vocal stylings, and moods. Meditatum II sets the template for the rest of the album, which after the second track felt like a bit of a letdown for me. I think the combination of the atmospherics and ambient riffs are a little too much for my taste across 43 minutes. Though it’s dynamic in its own way, it began to feel like a little too much of the same about halfway through. However, the album truly is quite meditative; I could see losing oneself, becoming entranced in its blanketed layers of melody, only to come to later wondering where the fuck was I just now? For those interested, kill the lights, put on a pair of great headphones, maybe even light a candle for some ambiance, and let this album bathe you in its ambient beauty.

###[Destroyer 666 - Unchain the Wolves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6ysBtURvYE) (1997)

This is my second foray into D666 after Cold Steel... I immediately liked the rawer production and performances on this album. Additionally, I like that the vocals lean a little more to the black metal side of things than on D666’s more recent albums. I typically don't like my thrash or black metal to have quite the "punky" feel that I get from D666, but it's made up for by the raw intensity than runs throughout all the songs. Every song is dripping with passion and conviction and rage. Especially when the occasional gang vocal came in I felt like marauding somewhere. Until looking it up just now, I wasn't even sure what the meaning of "maraud" was, but I realize now that without even knowing what it meant, the album indeed made me feel like marauding! The standout tracks (in a pretty big way) are the two epics, namely, Genesis to Genocide and Unchain the Wolves. They run the gamut from pretty to ugly to rage to sadness to epic in such a natural way that they stunned me. I wish D666 would go in more of the epic direction that they do on those songs more, because that's when I connect with their songs the most. The shrieks along with the beautiful guitar melodies near the end of Genesis to Genocide had me wishing the song would never end. The shorter, thrashier, angrier songs are good, but something about them feels....I don’t know. I just don't find myself being affected by them the same way as the longer songs. I'm going to give this one several more spins, though, because I find myself liking Cold Steel... more and more every time I listen to it, and I liked this one upon first listen more than I did that one. The wolves have been unchained, and I'm ready for them to devour me.
 
###[Deathspell Omega - The Synarchy of Molten Bones](https://deathspellomega.bandcamp.com/album/the-synarchy-of-molten-bones) (2016)
I still can't quite wrap my head around this one—like most Deathspell Omega records—even after several listens. However, here are several things I have identified in my first few listens: 1) It sounds like DSO; 2) If you like DSO, you will like this; 3) if you don't like DSO, this album will (probably) not change your mind; 4) It fucking rules. Starting and ending with apocalyptic horns, this album fittingly sounds like the end of the world. If you've heard DSO before, you know what to expect: absolutely ridiculous complexity, an inhuman drummer (or drum machine, which would make the "inhuman" part make sense), a meaty, buzzing bass presence, stop-start, whiplash producing riffs, and a large heaping of dissonance. Oh, and Satan. Vocals are alternately screamed, grunted, and shouted as we hear a man who seems to be losing his mind to impart cosmic knowledge upon us. Every song has something mind-blowingly awesome on it. From the subdued guitars and frantic blasts that end Famished for Breath, to the brilliant drum and bass groove that kicks off Onward Where Most with Ravin I May Meet, to the subtle chorals and the aforementioned symphonic elements, what we've got on our hands here is another state-altering mindfuck from the masters. This EP sounds like, rather than two steps forward or back, DSO has stepped two steps sideways. But when they're already on their own innovative and incredible left hand path, why would we want them to change their direction?

# **[Vektor - Terminal Redux ](https://youtu.be/WNmHtWERWyw)**

> And the reapers fly in

> Soon the cleansing begins

> And no longer we crawl

> Before we rise, many must fall

WOW where do I even start. I've been holding off this album for a long time now, simply because I wanted to read the lyrics while I was listening, and there is no way I could do that while doing something else. So, I finally found 70 minutes of free time, just sat down, opened up the lyrics and played this album. And I freaking loved it. It is just an adventure listening to this album. I'm not too into thrash, I only like the bigger 80s bands and a couple modern bands, so this really isn't my cup of tea, but here we go. The opening track really sets you up (both musically and narratively) and it gives you a great idea for what you're in for. Every song has some theme or dynamic that differentiates it from the rest of the album. For example, the second track, Cygnus Terminal, is a very somber song and you can tell just by the vocal delivery and the slower overall tempo from the previous song (still, tempo is very fast), and by the end of the second track, there's this feeling of triumph when David DiSanto screeches "I have arrived, like the rise of a massive tide", how the guitars and drums amplify that feeling. Or how in the same song, when our protagonist returns from his exile, DiSantos sings "I crossed the Great Divide, I now have command over time", lyrically you feel like you should be proud for the protagonist, but musically, the instruments do a good job in keeping the same somber tone, which kind of foreshadows the events to come. It's those little transitions that I adore, and Vektor completely aces their transitions. Now lyrically this album is already amazing, with many verse that can mean many things, but if you really want to experience the album for what it is, then you should read the lyrics while listening. There is a story in this album, and it's a good one. I won't get into it much because the ending is still confusing to me but I'm sure I'll understand it one day. Vocally, DiSantos is pretty hard to adjust to, but after hearing this album I asked myself if i could imagine ANY other type of vocals with this album, and I just couldn't. The screeching vocal delivery really fits the album stylistically in that it gives you a sinister feel. Now as for the record instrumentally, you just need to listen to a few minutes from the first track to know exactly what you're in for. What you're in for, are some very complex riffs, awesome bass lines and some thundering drum work. Vektor really utilizes both guitarists very well, working each one to their limit. The bass is also great in that sometimes it's an entity of its own; it doesn't really follow the drums or the guitars. The drums are just, amazing. The drum fills in this thing and the double bass drums work is just extraordinary. All in all: listen to this. It's not the genre defining album do the decade some are calling it, but it definitely is one of the better albums in recent memory. If you like the technical/prog thrash genre, give this a listen. If you're not too interested in lyrics than you'll be fine listening to this at your own leisure.

FAVORITE TRACKS: I love all of them, but the standouts were Charging the Void (track 1), Cygnus Terminal (track 2), Liquid Crystal Disease (track 3), Ultimate Artificer (track 5), and Pillars of Sand (track 8). Pteropticon and Psychotropia (tracks 6 and 5) are kind of 'transition tracks' if that makes sense. They aren't as epic as the rest of the album, but that doesn't mean they aren't good. Collapse (track 9) is ultimately the 'clean vocals' song, and I honestly thought I would hate it, but hey, I actually loved it. It's nothing that I see myself turning on at any moment, but it works. As for the last song, it's kind of like a final rush of adrenaline before the ultimate explosion. 

# **[Gorguts - The Erosion of Sanity](https://youtu.be/kvXR9ZRJuq0)** 

> A burying in darkness, you will have to bear

> Deep, you're drowned, in this optical nightmare

> in vortex, your visions collapse instantly

> now your life is condemned to obscurity

Now this one was recommended to me last WHYBLT thread, as I wrote about Gorguts' Obscura. I was told it was a much more straightforward album, a lot less complex than Obscura's extremely complex nature. And that's exactly what it is. It was the same band, same music, just toned down in complexity. That said, this still is a Tech death record. It still has its own complexity. Personally, I liked Obscura more, but this one had some things Obscura didn't. First off, I feel like this is an album I can play anytime because of it's length (clocking in at a nice 36 minutes), and it's more straightforward nature. With Obscura, I sometimes feel I have to dedicate all my attention to listening to it because of the amount of things going on in the song, but with this one the speed was generally a lot slower than in Obscura. Plus this one's a lot easier to headbang to. I didn't mention this in my last thread, but the vocals on these two are awesome. I don't know what it is, but I love them. I know that in Obscura there're two vocalists, but in this one it's only one, Luc Lemay. The way Lemay drags out the words works well with the slower double bass drums and the more streamlined riffs. The bass works very independent if that makes sense. For example on 'A Path Beyond Premonition' (track 6), there's this entire segment in the middle that's just a chugging guitar sound, simple drums, and a simple bass line. But it's very sinister in how it's a sudden change of pace. My only problem wth this one might be how it sometimes sounds 'samey' at certain points, but it's not anything huge. All in all, this is a great metal record. If you're still new to the genre, I'd say this would be a great start in the tech-death genre. If you're looking for something more complex and progressive, Obscura is the way to go. If you're looking for something that's just pure technical death without any nuisances, look no further than The Erosion of Sanity.

FAVORITE TRACKS: I don't want to choose any because I feel like this album works best as one entity, not as separate tracks. Just listen to the whole thing. But if I had to, the first three songs are the ones I find myself going back to the most, Condemned to Obscurity (2) being my favorite from those three. 

# **[Soen - Cognitive](https://youtu.be/9VEFORk1wYA)** 

> I don't even want to try

> To become the one

> That will save your halo

> Everything that I deny

> Every time that I lied

> Aware of our failure

My cousin came over to the REC thread in this sub, and he asked for bassy music. One of the recommendations he got was Cognitive by Soen. He listened to it, and I listened to bits of it. And I remember thinking to myself, "wow that's not my type at all." About four months later, here I am, listening to this thing nonstop. So I'll start with vocals. Here's the basic idea of what the vocals sound like: a better Mikael Akerfeldt (clean vocals). And no, it's not because both parties are Swedish. Joel Eklöf has a great voice that works really well, even when the songs sometimes get a little heavier than normal. The fusion between heavy drumming and more unconventional bass playing is what makes this album what it is. The guitars for the most part take a back seat to the bass. The guitars instead provide an atmosphere and background noise. The bass is the real star, with each song having a different style of bass playing. In Fraccions (1), the bass, guitars, and drums sound like a prog rock outfit, but in Delenda (2) the same instruments sound like a prog metal outfit, but in Oscillation (5) the SAME instruments sound very tech death inspired. Ultimately the entire album has the same overarching dynamic throughout, but it's those little changes that are changes enough that make every song on this record different. Lyrically, this album has a very somber or sorrowful tone to it. The lyrics are very creative and a lot of the verses aren't exactly black and white. I feel like this album won't appeal to everyone, as I can imagine someone calling this 'a Tool knockoff' or a 'It's just a phase, mom' album, but it's more than that. I really loved this album, I enjoyed listening it all the way through multiple times in the same day. I look forward to listening Tellurian next.

FAVORITE TRACKS: my favorite is Canvas (6). Everything about that track is just awesome. The lyrics are awesome, how this song gets heavier with each verse is freaking cool to me. I love the multiple buildups throughout, which leads up to the last buildup to an epic ending. It's just a satisfying song. Some other standouts were Savia (10) because it's just a culmination of everything awesome in this album , Fraccions (2) for the more groove oriented tone, Delenda (3) for the slap bass implemented in this one, Purpose (8) for the awesome chorus and overall lyrics centered song. What I'm trying to say is LISTEN TO THIS.

I wrote a piece about Sahg's newest album, but to my bitter surprise, I found out there's a 10000 character limit (since when is there a character limit). I'll save it for next time I guess. 

Thanks for reading, I enjoyed doing the last one a lot and I enjoyed doing this one too. I'm glad a lot of people enjoyed reading my last one. 

Also sorry if I seem incompetent when I'm describing what I like or don't like about music, I'm not really well versed in all the terminology and terms used to describe what this technique is or what that sound is. And I'm also sorry if my writing isn't all that good, English isn't my first language but writing stuff like this only helps me improve. Any criticisms on my writing or reviewing skills are welcome. Thanks again for reading. 

EDIT: fixed formatting
**Rhapsody/Rhapsody of Fire:** I think I can best describe them as symphonic power metal. If you're a fan of Dragonforce-style power metal, there's a lot to love here, but the band also has many songs/sections of songs filled with orchestral pieces. What really caught my eye about them though, was when I figured out their first 5 albums (as Rhapsody) are actually one continues story: The Emerald Sword Saga. I'm a big sucker for awesome stories in songs, which is why this peeked my interest.   
[Rhapsody - Gargoyles, Angels Of Darkness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ALY_mvAVsU) is a great song and the last in the emerald sword saga. I think it showcases all of the different styles the band likes to use during their songs well.

**Insomnium:** Basically my favorite band of all time. Pure melodic death metal goodness. Over the years their sound has evolved slightly, and now has moments reminiscent of doom metal and black metal, mixed in with the melodic death sound. This year they released the album "Winter's Gate" which is a 40 min one song masterpiece based off of a novel by the same name writing by the vocalist. They were inspired by Edge of Sanity's "Crimson" albums (also 40 min one song albums), which were released some years ago. Though in my opinion, this one blows the inspiration out of the water! The song has so many amazing sections and the guitars especially do nothing but spit out cool riff after cool riff. I can best describe this band as the gods of melodic death metal, in my opinion of course.

[Insomnium - In the Grooves of Death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7u-a-WVO6FM) is my second favorite song by them, only one better is the new Winter's Gate. Since I can't find Winter's Gate on YT, this one will have to suffice. Though it's best experienced if you listen to it after the rest of the "Above the Weeping World" album, let me explain: even though the album is not one continues story, it still feels that way because it starts out with rain (then the first song begins) and ends with rain. It feels like you're taken on a journey and released/finish it when the last song ends.
#2016 Black & Death Metal Workshop

As we count down the days like a horrid advent calendar to **Shreddit's Top Demos/EPs/Splits/Compilations of 2016** which takes place on **December 17th 2016**, Santa's elves are working furiously trying to mine that last bit of dark bile from veins of the underworld.

#[Obscure Evil - Void Fumes](http://tapewyrmmetal.com/archives/2007) 

Caligari Records does it again with an EP from Peruvian black / thrash imps. This is so good, I am sort of upset at this label always being cool because I should just work there. 

#[Mortals Path - Mortals Path](http://tapewyrmmetal.com/archives/1989)

I will say the only thing that is wrong with this German death metal demo are the song titles which are boneheaded and sound like a beatdown record rather than a competent death metal band which eats riffs for lunch. 

#[Black Citadel - Ancestral Shadows](http://tapewyrmmetal.com/archives/2001) 

Fans of really obscured raw black metal please step this way. People that do not like raw black metal please go through the exit here to safety. Ha! It was a trick. Its all raw black metal and spiders that fall from the ceiling. 

#[Commander - Apocalypse Vengeance](http://tapewyrmmetal.com/archives/2004) 

Canadian Beherit and Blasphemy worship from one mysterious guy who has not been confirmed nor denied to be apart of Beheirt or Blasphemy. This is going to interest like two of you but you can use this to clean off your hubcaps if you don't like listening to it. 

#[Burial Ground - End of the World](http://tapewyrmmetal.com/archives/1998) 

One man Russian black/speed act with a creator who is in a billion bands. It is not amazing but it is charming in its dedication.

#[Rare and Unfamiliar Music Hunt](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvMGwfEQz5rSJQFYFl6LWVA/videos?sort=dd&view=0&shelf_id=1)

If Anyone listened to that Yugoslavian electronic music compilation I posted yesterday, I have been losing my mind over this channel. Everything from Soviet rock to soundboard recordings of Texas funk festivals, if you didn't thank that sit existed, it is here in full albums. I think today is going to be [French coldwave / post punk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raFK9hJreC0)
Man, October was a good month for releases. Just wading through it now after getting back, and am spoilt for choice. Mainly just been following the mainstream and familiar releases for the past month, now trying to delve into more of the extreme metal releases. Thanks, AMG.

#Metallica - Hardwired#

Yep, everyon'es heard it. Spit Out the Bone and the Title Track are the solid thrash ones, Atlas Rise and Moth Into Flame are decent; they have abother one about Cthulhu which was pretty cool. But I've never, ever been a big Metallica fan. The most of I can ever say about them is that I dig some of their tunes, and this is the first album I can say that about since AJFA. So, good on them.

#Amaranthe - Maximalism#

This shit is awful. I love it. Honestly its not even metal; it's Europop/trance pop with heavy guitars. But some of the tunes are pretty damn catchy, like if you can enjoy Sia or Rhianna but want some guitars. But. In fairness, [the closing ballad track "Endlessly"](https://youtu.be/6N3L2VEjHSg) is fucking moving as shit.

#[Wardruna - Ragnarok](https://youtu.be/o_QbyP6q0AQ)#

Oh man have I been waiting for this. Yggsdrasil is one of my favourite albums. This one definitely lives up to the name; the war drums and horn throughout is definitely more apocalyptic; the childrens choir is hit and miss, and the closing track sounds like the end of the motherfucking world.

#[Anaal Nathrakh - The Whole of the Law](https://youtu.be/VQmAPs-qoao)#

I feel like their previous 3 albums are somewhat interchangeable, but with Vanitas being the most solid. This is continuing much in the same, but the production is a little more black metal, a little less punchy, a little more fuzzy. I dig it, but need more time with it. Definitely some killer tracks on it. Audio space horror, more in the vein of Event Horizon than Darkspace's more existential fear of the vast empty purposelessness of space.

#[40 Watt Sun - Wider Than The Sky](https://youtu.be/nGDXpH41roo)#

The softer style totally works for them, but I dont feel there are many tracks up the the quality of Restless, which itself has a live acoustic version which brings a tear to the eye.

#[Saor - Guardian](https://youtu.be/PjAb3GXHWdI)#

My favourite atmoblack band, and they've done it again, and I can feel the highland winds sweeping up my kilt. 

#Also been checking out:#
* Mithras - On Strange Loops

* Khemmis - Hunter

* Dark Tranquility - Aroma

* Deathspell Omega - The Synarchy of Molten Bones

* and the new Dillinger Escape Plan.

All those are good, but only listened to each once or twice. Not enough to really weigh in.

Also [Esben and the Witch](https://youtu.be/Aa0jVxNcg8Q) which is some pretty fucking mournful female fronted indie-style doom rock.

**[Antaeus - Condemnation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDvuhYioFJI)** - It's crazy to imagine that barely a month ago, the notion of a new Antaeus album was simple un-imaginable. And without much warning, the bomb dropped. Despite my potential reservations, this album has lived up to my expectations. Condemnation bridges the gap between the first two Antaeus records and Blood Libels, which had the cleanest production imaginable for an orthodox BM record. Antaeus delivers what they do best - raw, visceral and relentless black metal. Everything that Antaeus is here - the violent drumming, the dark atmosphere with dissonance (bit of Aosoth influence thrown in) and Mkm's hate-filled vocals. If you're tired of atmospheric BM and need something more aggressive, give this a spin.

**[Griffin - Flight of the Griffin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAKs29Yx1Nc)** - One of those underrated USPM bands that never went anywhere. Griffin take the less refined, more blue collar USPM approach to the genre - think Omen, Medieval Steel and Attacker to name a few. Iron Maiden/Priest-esque leads, great solo work and soaring vocals. Basically everything you want in a good USPM record.

**[Omen - Battle Cry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8WFl4Mo1yM)** - Pretty much the blueprint for everything that is good about blue collar USPM. A record so overflowing with energy and good vibes that it transports you to the fantasy world of warriors and magic sung by the unique vocals of J.D Kimball. I think no more needs to be said.

**[Su Ta Gar - Jaoitze Basatia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7VezIobXBU)** - Possibly the most famous Basque metal band. Su Ta Gar's debut is basically an homage to the early NWOBHM scene with a little bit of thrash thrown in as there as many moments of shamelessly lifting riffs from the first two Maiden albums and the odd Metallica one to spice things up. In spite of the imitation game, Su Ta Gar provide a very fresh take on it and still manage to craft one of the best trad/speed metal records of the early 90s. 
Deathspell Omega - Drought: Been relistening to this one. It's pretty amazing. I don't usually like black metal, but DsO is something else. And for some reason I always pick up traces of Sonic Youth (?!) in their sound.

Metallica - St. Anger. I never properly listened to this one before, so I thought -what the hell, and gave it a chance. I.... actually like it. It's not perfect, some songs work better than others, most songs could have been trimmed out, but it has an unique sound, which I highly appreciate, and there is a sense of actual anger, a sense of urgency, that comes out in every one of these songs, no matter how flawed they are. The Unnamed Feeling is IMHO one of Metallica's best songs.

Enslaved - The Sleeping Gods/Thorn: These are actually two EPs joined together in a comp album. It's still kinda short, but I think it's an interesting listening because it's pretty varied. You have an electronic trance track, a black/punk track, and a few other surprises.
[Demon Bitch - Hellfriends ](https://youtu.be/n03AEI2NiKM) 

/u/HighwayCorsair I'm on the hype train for this album now as well. This is killer heavy metal. Way better than Eternal Champion and the Eternal Champion album is pretty damn good. The vocals are the highlight of this album for me and I also love the raw production that you don't hear too often for modern Trad. 

[Hierophant - Mass Grave](https://youtu.be/pxRUXTO4eLY) 

Extremely surprised by how good this was. I've always liked their second album Penne but felt it fell a bit short. This album does not fall short. It is some of the most blistering black/grind/hardcore I've heard since one of The Secret's albums. They even incorporate some Asphyx esque doom parts on here as well. This'll be high on my list at the end of the year. 

[Gridlink - Longhena](https://youtu.be/AMlwGalMyzg) 

Bit late on really listening to Gridlink but fuuuuuuck is this good. They sound like a more technical Discordance Axis and I mean what else can you ask for really? For fans of fucking riffs and blasts.

[Uskumgallu - Rotten Limbs in Dreams of Blood](
http://vrasubatlat.bandcamp.com/album/vt-x-rotten-limbs-in-dreams-of-blood) 

This is my Black album of the year. Pure depression and anguish and filth as is expected from a Vrasubatlat band. The guitar work on this is amazing, as is every other instrumentation on here. Some nice DSBM moments on here as well that are reminiscent of Leviathan. Love it. 10/10.
[**Kymera** - ***No Mercy***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQIAZ_hWjHo) (1987) - Here is some mid-tempo and really melodic heavy metal from Germany. Lots of the riffs and vocal lines are written in major tonalities so that the whole package has a strong glam vibe, even including the obligatory [saccharine ballad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVAKqJR8g44). Hell, with their [silly clothes](http://www.metal-archives.com/images/3/2/5/8/32588_photo.jpg) you'd think they were part of the American scene. Barely memorable after a couple listens, but still it has some decent spots with a few catchy hooks. Check out ["Killer"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33klOIKqdWA) for their best riffs but don't expect greatness from this album.

[**Knightmare** - ***Mindless Mayhem***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHOm172NbFU) (1987) - Here is a some mildly thrashy/punky-feeling heavy metal from New Hampshire. The vocals are gritty and loud, and the rhythm section bounces around erratically with its super short songs and simplistic riffs. Yeah, it's heavy and hard-hitting, but it wasn't not a super engaging album to me at all. Note that this may be because I despise punk music and this just reminded me too much of the punk I've tried to listen to. Long story short, if you're looking for heavy metal but you also happen to like punk, don't listen to me; this album may be fantastic. But for those of you who want heavy metal, just move along. This isn't the band you're looking for.

[**Karisma** - ***Sweet Revenge***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHzAwSB0mI0) (1983) - This is some pretty early Brazilian heavy metal. It's low-fi and rough around the edges and the vocals aren't very good but they do fit the music. The vocalist is like a metal version of Bob Dylan: no training whatsoever but he still manages to pull it off. This is fast stuff, with some of the songs bordering on speed metal and the production is thick and dense but without being overly busy. I feel like this album could easily grow on me if I put the time and energy into delving into it more deeply, but for some reason it just didn't draw me very much after several spins. The closing track is a good example of what this album delivers; [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8HqDBOeZA8) is a pretty cool video of it.

[**Kaos** - ***Total Kaos***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ1OAEvH-Og) (1985) - This little thing from Canada is barely over twenty (20) minutes long and the first track isn't even spent on actual music as it's just a bunch of weird synths and a barely intelligible voiceover. Once the music actually starts, you know you're in for a real eighties treat. But no, not the eighties that gave us the greatest heavy metal in the world, but those other eighties. You know, the ones that gave us Blondie, E.G. Daily, and the Pet Shop Boys. Nothing against any of those artists, as I like all of them. But just know that if you're expecting some classic eighties metal here, it's actually a really mixed bag with a Debbie Harry clone on vocals. The aforetolinked instrumental is interestingly enough the album's strongest track and to be fair, the [closing ballad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQqJpwP116s) isn't bad either. But I can't say that this really deserves much attention.

* * *

What a weird set of picks for this week. I feel like I could get behind Karisma the most because I feel like maybe there is a depth to that album that I just haven't tapped into yet. Kymera definitely have their moments as well, but the album isn't consistent enough to tell somebody that it's worth tracking down. Kaos is most certainly skippable at best, and Knightmare just did absolutely nothing to engage me. So I'm sorry if you actually read this post hoping for a decent "K" band because I didn't get one for this draw. Stay tuned next time for "L" and cross your fingers and hope that I'll find something as strong as Leather Nunn.
[Kriegsmaschine - Enermy Of Man](https://ksmpl.bandcamp.com/album/enemy-of-man-lp-2014)

It's Mgla, but not. Perhaps a bit more immediate in their approach but afforded a little more room to be flashy, especially Darkside who plays the fuck out of the drums on this record and who must reign it in hard for his day job, it's a no-brainer for anyone who likes Exercises... or Hearts...

[Sinistro - Semente](https://projectosinistro.bandcamp.com/album/semente)

Plodding doom with surprisingly uplifting vocals to accompany it. Heard about them through friends saying their Damnation set was great and will hopefully catch them on the Alcest/Mono tour. Kinda reminds me of Mammoth Weed Wizard Bastard sometimes, but with less fuzz and more brooding.

[Fluisteraars - Luwte](http://records.eisenton.de/album/luwte)

Probably my favourite find from black metal November so far, touching both on the weirdness of their countrymen Urfaust and the tremolo-driven introspection of bands like WITTR but never quite losing forward momentum like both those bands sometimes do. Will have to check out the new EP next. Also, the Netherlands are strange in their black metal output.

[Khemmis - Hunted](http://listen.20buckspin.com/album/hunted-2)

I'm not typically one to let 'buzz' (it's all relative) stop me from listening to something. But for some reason I hadn't got around to hearing this yet and it feels like that was part of the reason. Thankfully it's pretty great, with winding riffs and melodies like Elder whilst still affording space to some of the more doomy moments that the aforementioned seems to skip over. Reminds me occasionally of Anciients, which is never a bad thing.
Battle Dagorath - Dark Dragons of the Cosmos

I have been following the albums at the top in Bandcamp and so far have rarely been disappointed. This one reminds me a bit of In The night side Eclipse and is pretty well written IMO. The riffs are spectacular and the synths lurking in the background are just awesome and make for an amazing atmosphere.

Malleus - Storm of Witchcraft

Pretty good Hellhammer worship, I was mistaken to call it "war metal" when I posted it here. I am really digging this kind of more "primitive" music. Just badass riffs, crushing drums and raw vocals. After nearly a year of delving into all kinds of more easily consumable metal, including the more polished ones with nice clean production this is a welcome change. Thinking about digging deeper into this kind of music.

Wretch - Wretch 

Amazing trad doom with crazy good songwriting. Really digging them

Albatross - Fear from the skies

King Diamond influenced music, and I think they nail it without sounding derivative or boring. Great songwriting with cheesy, lighthearted horror themed lyrics.

Heathen Beast - Rise of the Saffron Empire

My favourite band from India right now. They have really good lyrics and their inclusion of traditional instruments is pretty spot on without ever getting out of place or weird. My favourite part of them are still the lyrics. I have posted them here a couple of times.

Void Omnia - Dying Light

Another current go-to I found through Bandcamp. I like this kind of black metal, well produced kind of clean sounding and builds up a great atmosphere. IMO this is the kind of music that you can play in the background while studying, it doesn't disturb you nor does it just fade into the background.

In an unrelated note, I am continuing my marathon of listening to complete discographies. I started around a month and half ago, I try to listen to as much stuff as I can 

Led Zeppelin

Death

The Who

King Crimson

Caravan, Van de Graff generator (more prog stuff)

Burzum (and their contemporaries, not their complete discographies but I think I have covered their essentials)

Genesis

Creedence Clearwater Revival

Bathory

If you guys have any suggestions I would love to try them out.
I really need to stop procastinating and listen to thase albums more and actually get thase written before the same day I have to get thase out.


**My Dying Bride**

Been relistening to their albums. I still love them, but my opinions on some of their albums have changed (I now love 34.788% Complete and I've warmed up on Like Gods of the Sun) and I finally got around to listening to the two albums by them I hadn't gotten around listening to before, which are For Lies I Sire and A Map of All Our Failures. My thoughts on them is that Lies I Sire is their weakest album but it's still really good and A Map of All Our Failures is great but I feel Misery is a better album


**Voivod - Voivod** 

I didn't know what to expect with this album. I mean I love Voivod, but I've heard not so positive things about this album and the rest of the Jason Newstead era and this album in praticular is the lowest rated one on M-A while on RYM it's the opposite. But let's just say I liked it, but it isn't really memorable besides the closing track We Carry On.


**Theatre of Tragedy – Musique/Assembly**

The only Theatre of Tragedy album I listened to before thase two albums was Aegis, which I fucking love. I went into Assembly first since it was the shorter one expecting an another goth metal  band adding industrial metal elements to their music like Septic Flesh and My Dying Bride did with Revolution DNA and 34.788% Complete represcitivly. What I wasn't expecting though, was an electropop album, and I fucking hate pop music but this album wasn't so terrible, just boring. Don't really have much else to say about it except that I kinda liked the opener Automatic Lover.

Now on to Musique, which is more closer to industrial rock/metal. I prefer this album over Assembly  because I liked a few tracks on this, mainly Fragment and Crash/Concrete. But besides those two tracks the whole album isn't good nor bad, just boring.



**[Ark - Burn the Sun](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjbwZeisK3QAhUEJCYKHaW8DCYQtwIILTAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DePAqUc958vQ&usg=AFQjCNE-p359gxUMmmwnuV2zBO-5Fkfzdg&sig2=VhOcJlSz1P_6NhlhQhr5lA&bvm=bv.139138859,d.eWE) (2001)** - This is an old favorite I've revisited recently.  Progressive power metal/rock featuring Jørn Lande (Masterplan, Beyond Twilight, Jorn) on vocals as well as 4 other well accomplished musicians in John Macaluso, Tore Otsby, Randy Coven and Mats Olausson.  Sadly, Randy and Mats have since passed away but this album is a testament to their ability as songwriters.  Coven's fretless bass work in particular is incredible.  Otsby's guitar playing is also other worldly and he is very versatile, being able to play many styles with ease.  Also, Jorn's vocals are as usual very powerful and emotional, and Mats and John also kill it on this album.   If you want catchy, well-crafted songs with a shit load of technical chops just beneath the surface that do not take away from the songs as a whole, then you have to listen to this album.

**[Bal-Sagoth - A Black Moon Broods Over Lemuria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN_P2mmm24Q) (1995)** - This is the debut album of Epic symphonic black/death metal masters Bal-Sagoth.  If you've heard some of this band before and think it's too over the top, I recommend you give this album a listen.  The keyboards are much more subdued and this album is more straightforward atmospheric death metal.  I purchased the vinyl remaster and am eagerly awaiting it's arrival.

**[Sikth - Opacities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZS5Nlfc2MKE&t=1011s) (2015)** - Mini album from the technical metalcore/djent masters.  If you're into bands like Periphery you must check this band out.  They are widely influential on the djent scene and this album is their long awaited return after almost a decade hiatus.  Really well-crafted songs with catchy choruses, killer breakdowns, technical acrobatics and the typical silly undertones you come to expect from Sikth.  Highly recommended listen.
Can't remember the name of the album off the cuff, but the cover art is the band standing in the woods with their name across the top written in spiny letters. Really great shit.
For everyone in this thread who isn't doing NBBMN, I'm making a list and I'm checking it twice and Satans going to find out who's trve.

Personally i've been been loving Wodensthrone - Loss. This is folky, somewhat symphonic black metal. If you like Fen or Nokturnal mortum give this a go. Its also somewhat bittersweet as they've split up this year :(

[Wodensthrone - Loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNsA7-WLlMk)
[**Setentia - Darkness Transcend**] (https://blood-music.bandcamp.com/album/darkness-transcend)


A very impressive piece of dissonant technical death metal, peppered with some BM influences. Though I'm not a big fan of the production, this album is a thoroughly enjoyable experience. A lot of Ulcerate influences here, but the record definitely still stands on its own.
[Aeternam - Moongod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LE6JmQEYkrk)

Aeternam is a small band from Canada taking inspiration from both Arabic and Mayan gods and history. With songs such as Invading Jerusalem or Rise of Arabia, they show important events in the middle-east, like the religious crusades, while songs such as Xibalba explore interesting aspects from the South American history. The music is mostly influenced by Arabic elements, the melodic and thrash sound is complemented with ambient orchestrations. The low and raw harsh vocals are contrasting with the acoustic guitar parts and the use of clean vocals. The concept around the music is clear and original. The drum beats make your head move, the riffs are clear, the production is great. You can often hear lead harmonies, the bass is roaring when it needs to, some parts use hand drumming to sound more traditional. The second album "Moongod" has huge orchestrations while the first one, "Disciples of the Unseen" is closer to plain melodic death metal. I love both albums and recommend both.


[Be'lakor - Vessels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrAmu7KuWPs)

Be'lakor is a growing band rocking from Australia. Their music is very hard to describe, the least I could say is it is a very unique mix of melodic death metal and progressive metal. Simply put, it's a crossover of Opeth and Insomnium. Vessels is their fourth album and came out earlier this year. The vocals are very raw and low, the guitar tone is incredible and the music is very heavy while still being melodic. The riffs do not sound like the generic death metal riffs you hear on every other albums. The rhythm section is on point, the bass is super clear while the drums pound the tempo into your head. The thematic of the album revolves around life and death, nature and philosophy. Probably album of the year for me.


Other than that, I've been listening to well known artists who don't need any description, such as Insomnium, Ensiferum or Wintersun.
Decapitated - Winds Of Creation

Polish technical death metal band Decapitated's debut album, released in 2000, is an absolute classic, in my book. I've been listening to this album pretty much exclusively for a few weeks now, simply because of how supremely well crafted it is. Winds Of Creation doesn't really bring anything new to the table, but it rearranges all the parts that were already there into a glorious mastercraft of brutal, technical, melodic, and catchy as fuck death metal album that any metal fan in their right mind just has to listen to at least once in their life. Everyone who worked on this album - meaning the band members - are incredible musicians. Well, Sauron, the vocalist, is a bit one-note, if you will, but his guttural roars fit the album's tone all too well, really emphasising the punch in the gut that is this band's riffular talent. Holy shit, the riffs on this album. They're almost incomprehensibly headbangable in places. Take the main riff from The Eye of Horus, for instance, a frantic, up and down tremolo motion on the guitar that just sounds badass, for lack of a better word. Or the main riff, again, from the title track, Winds of Creation, which is just so energetic and fucking metal.  Look, it's very difficult to describe how amazing this band is using Earthly adjectives, you really need to listen to them yourself. Keep in mind, when doing so, that the drummer, Vitek, was 15 at the time of recording this album. The guitarist, Martin, I believe, was 16, the vocalist, Sauron, was 17 or 18, and the bassist, who's name escapes me at the moment, and who is barely audible for the most part, which is a bit of a shortcoming of this album, was 18, methinks. Keep that in mind when listening to Vitek's insane double bass rides or frantic blast beats, and Martin's perfect solos and excellently executed, highly technical riffs. 
Basically, I'm saying you gotta listen to this band. They are brutally heavy in all the right places, technical and tricky in all the others, with an excellent helping of teenage angst to really bring it all together. If I was to rate this album I'd give it a 9 out of 10, but I think numbered rating systems are kind of pointless, so fuck it. Have a listen to Winds Of Creation and thank me later. 

Recommended tracks: The First Damned, Nine Steps, The Eye of Horus, Winds of Creation, Dance Macabre
[Fragments of Creation - Sunburst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FObmzEYpAQ)

They're progressive power metal, but wait, they sound nothing like Symphony X or even Blind Guardian later years. So many vocalists in this subgrenre annoy me with their overly high voices, but this vocalist is very pleasing to listen to. He sounds like a young Roy Kahn from Conception and Kamelot. I even looked them up on YouTube to see how good they sound live and was highly impressed.

And unlike other prog power bands, they are actually fucking heavy. Gus Drax (Why are Greek guys always called Gus?) on the guitar wanks enough to be pleasing and interesting but not Dream Theater annoying. But, I do have a few complaints, and since they are a relatively new band, they get a pass. The drums are flat, the bass is buried, the guitars are crunchy and djenty. Please dirty up the production a bit.


[Wintersun - Wintersun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ziAsMTs9sg)

How the fuck was I not into this band before? Melodic Death Power Metal. Damn, I've been listening to a lot of power metal this week. There is a reason, but it's kind of a secret.
Finally gave Avantasia's Ghostlights a listen all the way through. I've listened to some of the individual songs before, but it was my first for a few of them. Anyway, pretty good album. Feels more operatic than stuff I've heard from them before, and I'm a big fan of symphonic metal, so that works nicely for me. Also perhaps leans more towards hard rock on some tracks, but... whatever. Favourite track would probably be Let The Storm Descend Upon You, has a sense of grand scale to it that I quite like. I should probably check out some more Edguy.

I've also had Devin Townsend's Addicted in my rotation a lot. Like the super-heavy industrial-ish sound to about half of it. Not as much of a fan of the more ambient other half, but iz okay, I guess.
**CROWBAR - The Serpent Only Lies**
I've been listening to this album pretty much non stop since Friday. I had trouble getting into older Crowbar when I first started delving into sludge metal, and I stepped away from them for awhile. The first track, Falling While Rising, showed up in a playlist on Spotify and I was really interested. Started listening to the newest album, and that was the sound I had been looking for. They really had me hooked with The Enemy Beside You: "If you grew a set of balls, it just might change your life." I really think this album is for me the perfect execution of sludge metal. It's dark, guttural, raw, and has all of the aspects of both metal and hardcore punk that I really look for in any band.

**WHORES. - Gold**
I mean...fuck yeah right? I started listening to Whores. about a year ago, because some people I worked with were close with them (designed their posters, shirts, etc). Up until now they've only had like 11 tracks out, and I've listened to all of them an unhealthy amount of times. So when I heard they were recording their first full length album, I went a little crazy. They've really dialed in their sound on this album, I think it's just the right amount of chaos with a little bit of restraint. Sort of like a clenched fist with veins bursting. The absolute highlight of the album was finding out that they re-recorded "Bloody Like the Day You Were Born." I think I still have a slight erection.
Some new releases I've been checking out:

**Bolzer - Hero** 

I had high hopes for this LP based off their EPs, but the question always lingered: could Bolzer craft a solid 40 minutes of music that lived up to the hype of their shorter releases? After a few cringe-inducing listens, I have to say the answer is a very strong NO. This album blows, and it's due to one very key factor: the songwriting's focus shifted from massive riffage to having "unique" vocal parts. Most of the songs here have some really awkward clean vocals that just doesn't do it any favours. I have zero problem with bands experimenting with this stuff, and in fact, Bolzer has pulled this off on their EPs rather well. Here, the riffs are just lost to make room for these parts. The only track that actually kicks my ass is "Phosphor" ("Spiritual Athleticism" is also pretty cool). The rest just have too many parts that are underdeveloped or downright cringy. It's a shame too, because the actual production on this LP is great. Perhaps this is the most disappointing album of the year.

**Krypts - Remants of Expansion**

Krypts' debut LP was enjoyable but it wasn't exactly memorable for me. Here, they've really stepped things up by offering 5 well penned songs. There seems to be emphasis on slow/mid tempos but they'll still push themselves to the threshold of their playing. The "pace and space" (to borrow a term from basketball) seems to have treated them well - it's creepy, it's eerie, and it's downright evil sounding. I drove around with this in my car the day I received it in the mail and everything just sounds so massive. Definitely a huge improvement on their previous efforts!

**Deathspell Omega - The Synarchy of Molten Bones**

Deathspell returns after a 4 year silence to deliver 30 minutes of chaos across 4 songs. I thought "Paracletus" was an incredible LP, with the "Drought" EP being more of an afterthought. Wasn't really sure what to expect from DSO but they certainly managed to deliver something worth hearing. I think this one is a lot more aggressive than "Drought" and that's what makes it better for my tastes.
Void King. Go listen to them. Do it. DO IT NOW.
**Diabolic Night**

Pounding evil black/speed that ticks all the right boxes - Running Wild riffs (one of the demo songs might as well be called "Adrian II: Son of Son of Satan"), Flying V prominent in both artwork and band pic, covering early Kat ... damn good stuff, and with luck a full-length will be on the horizon soon enough.

["Unleash the Abyss"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX5nT7ddXGg) - from *Sepulchral Magic* EP ('14)

["Infernal Power"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzGQHHy3pOE) - from *Infernal Power* 7" ('15)

-------------

**Beowulf**

(Not the Venice Motörhead-ed crossover Beowülf, but the other SoCal Beowulf, the one that was a few years early to the party.)

If Riot had made an album between Narita and Fire Down Under, it probably would've sounded pretty close to Slice of Life, which came out during the year between those two Riot albums. Come to think of it, anyone know for sure that Mark Reale and Guy Speranza *didn't* head out west for a few weeks in 1980? Seriously though, it's not close enough for shitty fan theories, but if you dig early Riot this one should be a given ... unless a lack of baby harp seals is a dealbreaker, I guess.

["The Hounds of Tindalos"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVdoKXBJP10) - from *Slice of Life* ('80)

["Getaway"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxEmsUfJIlA) - from *Slice of Life* ('80)

------------

**Silent Scream**

With a name (probably) cribbed from Slayer and Gene Hoglan in the producer's chair, it's not too hard to guess what they sounded like. Goes well with Exhorder, Demolition Hammer, Devastation's Idolatry, etc., and has a similar knack for bludgeoning, midtempo parts ... which (unlike the others) they came damn close to over-relying on, but hey. 

[*From the Darkest Depths of the Imagination*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUL7WFqxKMs) ('92)
[Fleshgod Apocalypse - Labyrinth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lSJEx6YM14&list=PL-TnC9KdHpj_e5bCwOR6JZJqzKjYQJDgc)

I know this album got a lot of negative reviews compared to their first two albums, but this is the album that got me into them about a year ago. The first time I heard Minotaur (Wrath of Poseidon) I knew I found a new favorite band and genre (I hadn't fully committed to listening to death metal yet). The album as a whole still is absolutely amazing to me, my favorite tracks being Kingborn, Minotaur, and Epilogue.

[Panopticon - Autumn Eternal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7xAPWklfJw)

Another album from this decade, its a masterpiece to me that I have kept tossing into the mix of what I listen to since it was released last year. As with Labyrinth, this was my first exposure to Panopticon, and since then I've gone back to listen to most of his work, always absolutely blown away by the atmospehere Austin Lunn can create. The instrumental Tamarack's Gold Returns never ceases to amaze me with how much atmosphere Lunn can create. The following Into the North Woods and Autumn Eternal are two heavy hitting songs, but for me the album peaks with the transition of Pale Ghosts into A Superior Lament. From reviews of the album, I have seen A Superior Lament to be reviewed as a low point of the album, but the clean vocals that appear about four minutes into the song always blow me away

[Isis - Panopticon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oc2E5WcQsfw)

I was extremely late to finding this album, only listening to it for the first time about two months ago when So Did We appeared on my Spotify Discover Weekly, but its been in constantly rotation as I walk around campus to class since then. So Did We is a great opening track with an amazing transition into Backlit. In Fiction keeps the pace of solid tracks, but I personally find myself always skipping to Syndic Calls. I can't pinpoint the part of the track that has me mesmerized, but it has been a staple for me. Overall the album runs about an hour, with very little vocals within the time. This is fine though, as the music itself is the key focus and not the vocals on the album. 
Not as much this week. I have been a bit too busy to keep up with it all.

**[Black Hole – Land of Mystery – Progressive – 1985](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Black_Hole/10520)**

~~Spotify~~

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlkPxq1BZaE)

A real easy listen. Vocals sounded a little like Rob Halford on first listen but the music and composition is both interesting and soothing. It’s a shame they only released 2 full length albums.




**[Agalloch – Discography](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Agalloch/305)**

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3Meu28o8P5z9Zjm6NTGihT)

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO9bHbL-dJY1XUAq_yNicTw/playlists)

Although I never got the chance to see them live (insert sadness here) I really love this band and was/ is one of my favourites. I know that they might not be the best band but the music is relaxing, entertaining and very well composed. This is that one band I cannot stop listening too.

[Uskumgallu - Rotten Limbs in Dreams of Blood](https://vrasubatlat.bandcamp.com/album/vt-x-rotten-limbs-in-dreams-of-blood)

This is actually a repost of a comment I wrote yesterday but I figured I'd include it here to go along with /u/ParaTC. 

Basically the typical things that make black metal great. I love the riffs, vocals, and find the hazy production interesting. 

I'll use the second song, Rotten Limbs as reference. It is the same riff for basically the whole song but it works really well. I like how they keep building around that riff and the intensity of the song increases for the first several minutes. I really like the barking growl he does at the 2 min mark and at other parts of the album. 

I also love how low sounding the one riff is in Monolith Dementia. I think it is interesting how it is buried in the hazy production and pounding drums. Good cymbal rides too. The drums cut out around the 5:20 mark for a nice doom effect. I'm a big fan of "half-time" breaks.

I have the album on tape and drive an old car with a tape deck so this is a part of my regular commute. 

#[Oozing Wound - Whatever Forever](https://oozingwound.bandcamp.com/album/whatever-forever) (2016)

For the last few years I'd occasionally see these guys written about as some kind of thrash revival outfit, in the same breath as Power Trip, Iron Reagan, or Municipal Waste.  I tried their previous albums but nothing ever stuck with me.  But this new one has got its hooks in.

I don't *think* it's thrash, really, but I'll let more seasoned ears be the judge.  What I do hear is elements of thrash combined with noise rock and even classical minimalism—discordant, short riffs repeated at unusually great length.  Almost like they took a page from Orthrelm taking a page from Philip Glass.

Anyway, it's killer.  I also love the fact that in addition to classic galloping thrashy-sounding riffs there's unusual harmonic movement.  Kind of like a thrash equivalent of melodeath, except the melodic aspect isn't stupidly corny.
Fyrnask - Forn 
http://fyrnask.bandcamp.com/album/f-rn

Black Metal with very rich atmosphere, vocals at times kind of remind me of Solstafir. About half of the album is BM the rest is very primal rhythms. It's tagged as "ritualistic black metal" if that helps my weak description. Awesome artwork too, that's what drew me in to it. The vinyl is on its way to me at this moment! 

[**Mantar - Ode to the Flame**](https://mantar.bandcamp.com/album/ode-to-the-flame) (2016)

I was a massive fan of the 2014 LP by these guys, so naturally I was hyped for a new release. As expected, they continue putting out low, aggressive riffs and raw vocals as a stripped down 2 piece. Lots of really interesting songs and good compositions. They have a real feel of how to write a song that has valleys and peaks. The only thing I really think they could use is guitar solos. Maybe it's just not their thing, but by the end of the record I felt like I needed something to break up the downturned pummeling.

**Blind Guardian - First 3 Albums**

I have never really gotten into Blind Guardian. Everything I listened to seemed to be overly operatic, symphonic, and just kind of corny. Like, I can get down with some power metal, but it just seems unnecessary to add violins and organs and... I dunno. Their first three albums are completely different though. It's like very polished fantasy speed metal with a great vocalist, and has completely blown me away. If you are someone who isn't really into their new stuff, go listen to the first record, it's like Scanner and Bathory had a baby that loved DnD.
**Avenged Sevenfold** - *The Stage*
Some people give the band shit for the mainstream-ness of it, and the fact that their logo is very similar to Overkill's. Some would also say they're not "Metal Enough." I would agree to a point with some of their material. The most recent album has excellent drumwork and enjoyable riffs. They also went more progressive, with a concept album revolving around things like AI, Nuclear War, and such.

**Anything I Find By Dio**
Ronnie James Dio is about as metal as you can get. This includes all Sabbath songs with him, Heaven and Hell (Basically Sabbath), Dio, Rainbow, and Elf (Formerly A Beach Boys style Doo-Wop band titled "Ronnie Dio and the Red Caps.)

**Ride The Lightning** 
I recently found a copy of this album I had, and have been listening to that for the past few weeks. Absolutely amazing.

**Overkill**
A friend of mine introduced me to this band recently, and I've heard a few of their songs. About as thrash metal as you can get with Elmo on vocals.
**[Sale Freux - Adieu, Vat!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dgskrBwdW4)** (2016)

Sale Freux is one of those extremely French black metal bands, where the vocals are so French they get into that area of nasal-y shrieks (you'll know it when you hear it). It's also pretty raw at times, pretty unpolished. However, when they hit a great song, they really do well. "Idylle" is definitely my favourite song on the album, but there are few more that are quite enjoyable. This band has a ton of previous albums, but I've only heard the two released this year.

**[Cultes des Ghoules - Coven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eL_roSSe_Q)** (2016)

Is it super long? Yes. Is it too long? Depends on how long you like your music. It's not too long for me. I've had other albums that were too long, this one is not. The pacing of the songs and the variety each song holds is enough to sustain me the full 1hr 40 minute run time or whatever it is. Once again, Cultes Des Ghoules manage to bring some awesome riffs. I'm not familiar with this guitar tone in other bands, so it sounds really awesome and unique to me. Maybe other bands use this as well, but if they do, I don't know them. Quite happy with this album, check it out if you can handle almost 2 hours of one band!

**[Crippled Black Phoenix - Bronze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLKjk9c8OTc)** (2016)

I've actually been a big fan of CBP ever since their sophomore came out so many years ago. The mega track "Time of Yer Life..." was song of year for my in 2009. Some of their other albums have been hits, some have been misses. *I, Vigilante* is good, *(Mankind) The Crafty Ape* is no good. Etc etc. So when this new album was mentioned on that very handy Saturday thread, I checked it out! It's definitely one of their good albums! I like the riffs, I like the guitar tone, the vocals, though mute, pair very nicely with everything else. It's just an enjoyable progressive/post-rock album. I don't know if anyone else will enjoy it here, but I sure do!

I won't mention the DsO because I think other people have covered it, but long story short, it's amazing and I love it. 
**[Anaal Nathrakh - The Whole of the Law](https://open.spotify.com/track/075jSmV95NQJxazrAEVda1)** - I remember a few years ago I got a Decibel flexidisc with some Anaal Nathrakh stuff. I hadn't really been into anything that heavy but it stuck with me. Every time they put out new material it's an experience. Their music wants to show you all the ways you could die and what sort of noises that would make. I recommend these guys to anyone who will listen. Overall I think this release is more varied in intensity than their older stuff. It's easier to find a few hooks, some subtle orchestration, and other catchy bits in between thumping samples and drawn out walls of noise. I like this album a lot and I think it'll hang around with me for a bit. I'm not quite sure yet if this is my new favorite Anaal Nathrakh album, currently that's Vanitas, but it's in the running.

**[Brutally Deceased - Satanic Corpse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlzikvZOiE8)** - This reminds me a lot of the earlier and rougher Swedish DM bands even though there are times when it feels like Iron Maiden recording Death Metal. My first listening experience was not great and the album didn't sit right with me. I put it down, walked away for a bit and started from the beginning and the second and third times through this is a killer record. I think I'll forget about this album in about a week and then in a year I'll remember how much I enjoyed it and repeat this whole process over again like I do with that Solipsist album once every 18 months.

**[Whores - Gold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqOKDaJ-ZSI)** - Low, grunge-y, bluesy, depressed, angry, but catchier this time around. There's something about the guitar tone these guys put together that gets me every time it comes on. I was a big fan of the last album, Clean, and this is a bit catchier and a little less sludge-y. In my opinion it's just as good just in a little different direction. In Clean it felt like the groove pulled me right along from the first note and just never stopped lurching and sliding forward, with Gold there's a little more opportunity to breath between the yelling and amp stacks.
Lord Fist - Green Eyleen

Also found an obscure band that isn't around anymore called "Tailgunner" originally named "Misty Knight". 

Tailgunner stuff is more like Traditional Heavy Metal while Misty Knight was more doomy. Interesting stuff.
I'm seeing Vektor tonight, so I've been listening to Terminal Redux all day at work.
[Eldamar- The Force Of The Ancient Land](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZxiRot5ApY) **2016**

Eldamar is basically a one-man band project by a guy from Norway. 
His music style is Atmospheric/Ambient Black Metal and I've gotta say It's one of the best things I've heard recently. I love his music because It's so calming for me. I listen to it whenever I just feel that I wanna chill. What I also like is how he uses keyboard to produce these interesting riffs that change from time to time, but still remain quite similar. His songs pretty much don't have lyrics, but he uses a female voice which sometimes sings along with the keyboard riff, and from time to time, he inserts that amazing screeching black metal scream.  
Eldamar currently has only one album, but I gotta say it is a blast and I hope he releases more stuff in the future.
°•°Whitechapel - Our Endless War°•°

Favorite tracks!:
• The Saw is The Law
• Blacked Out
• Worship the Digital age

Loving the album so far, I think its a great realse on the side to Whitechapel. Thanks y'all.
**Metal:**

* **Axeman - Arrive**. Amebix have been on heavy rotation for me for most of this year, and learning that Eduado Ramirez (Volahn) has an Amebix-worshipping side project was a very welcome discovery. He’s only done a three-track EP, but It’s completely shameless and I love it. ‘Metnal’ has a central riff that’s just ‘Arise!’ but faster and grubbier. Support!

* **Shataan - Weigh of the Wolf**. Continuing with the Black Twilight Circle worship, I’ve been listening to Shataan’s debut from this year in the car a lot. Shades of recent Voivod stuff and very reminiscent of Circle of Oroborous in the use of clean vocals in a rough, UG black metal setting. Speaking of which…

* **Circle of Oroborous - Tree of Knowledge.** I’ve only really scratched the surface of these guys’ discography but have liked what I’ve hear so far, so when I saw this for a couple of quid in Northern Darkness’ closing down sale I had to grab it. It’s more raw and ‘black metal’ than the other stuff i’ve heard which was ‘watery’ sounding with weird clean vocals. It works really well on this record though, the second track has some great Blut Aus Nord-esque riffing on it. 


* **Ulcerate - Shrines of Paralysis**. Not sure about this tbh. When I heard ‘The Destroyers of All’ when it came out it was a revelation, I loved the tension between the memorable riffs, brutal drumming, sense of space and feeling that the song structures were on the verge of breaking down all the time. ‘Vermis’ didn’t leave much of an impression, and this new one hasn’t clicked. The first half is a bit off-putting, it has that Ulcerate ‘sound’ but they tear through riff after riff which never feel like they’re going anywhere. The second half is a bit more slow, open sounding and atmospheric and all the better for it. 

* **Neurosis - Fires within Fires** - What a return to form! Best thing since ‘The Eye of Every Storm’, and has a similar feel to that record in lots of ways. No filler, just 5 brilliantly crafted, flowing songs with awesome riffs and a really transporting soundscape. Album art by Thomas Hooper too.

**Power Electronics:**

* **Iron Fist of the Sun - Behavioural Decline** - Saw this guy support Merzbow in Manchester and to be honest he stole the show. Well-Structured tracks with a soundscape similar to early TG in evoking a grey, decaying, broken-down Britain. The atmospheres and writing remind me a lot of Prurient’s best work. Leading to…

* **Prurient - Unknown Rains**. I found last year’s Frozen Niagra Falls (which I think was supposed to be some kind of breakthrough record) overlong and unfocused. This new record is much more successful in wedding a darkly filmic, even romantic atmosphere to PE, at a quarter of the length.

**Punk:**

* **Crass - The Feeding of the 5000**. The hopeless political/economic/social situation spurred me to listen to some of the anarcho stuff I used to worship so I dug this out. Definitely a mixed bag, the lyrics are frequently annoying but you forgive them when they’re blasting away through tracks like ‘Securicor’. I like the use of noise and the roughness of the production but it is very thin and weak, a bit like a lot of their lentil-munching followers. Still a fan though!

* **Gutter Gods - Innersense**. This is a weird one. Street punk with a scary skinhead frontman, kind of sounds like the RAC stuff you listen to on youtube and immediately feel guilty about but it’s got a weird sci-fi/psychedelic aesthetic and has noise tracks and sample collages mixed in between the riffy tracks. Dig it!
**Cultes Des Ghoules - Coven**

It's going to take another listen or ten, but I'm not quite sure what to make of this album right now.  It's top notch stuff, the ambiance and riffage are as good as Henbane.  But I'm not so sure about the songs.  I think they reached a little too far here, and 90 minutes is just too long for an album, full stop.  I think it would be much better with a little pruning.  Of course, I'll probably buy it and listen to it thirty times, but still.

**Arizmenda - Beneath This Reality of Flesh**

I don't really have many thoughts on this one that I didn't have for Volahn.  I was pretty surprised to find that they didn't have any members in common, because both have this sort of "DSO-in-a-major-key" feel.  Like Volahn, they take a lot from DSO, with chaos being the order of the day.  However these guys (this guy, now that I look it up) are a little closer to Nightbringer and Ahklys in their approach.  I'm definitely giving these guys a few more spins as I work though this monstrous final project this week.

**Deletere - Les heures de la peste**

From how much good I've heard about this band, I was kind of surprised to find how, I don't know, close to atmoblack they were?  It is *extremely* tasteful atmoblack though, and closer to the depressive end of things, which is where the genre in general could stand to be, I think.  Real good stuff though, and definitely the best QBM I've listened to, though that doesn't account for much.

**Akitsa - Sang Nordique**

Another band that was not at all what I was expecting.  I didn't expect it to be either quite this low-fi or quite this punk-heavy.  The first I'm cool with, the second I'm going to have to get used to.  Usually I'm down with punk-infused metal, but this just is not tastefully done at times, I feel.  When it is tastefully done though, it's really good.  I'm going to give their latest another listen-through, I only went through it once.


###[Death – The Sound of Perseverance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjB101k2Bog) (1998)

I'm only recently learning more about death metal; its something I've always liked but never really explored aside from the first four cannibal corpse albums. I've always been more of a black metal guy, but i'm a bit burnt out on that right now. Early this week, I just randomly came across Death's cover of Judas Priest's Painkiller (at the 50:20 mark) while browsing youtube and I was completely blown away by Schuldiner's vocals and high shrieky voice on that track. I went back to listen to the rest of the album and found myself just in love. The instrumentation was stunning, and Schuldiner's vocal range was almost downright scary. The only thing I had heard from them before was Zombie Ritual -- another damn fine song -- so I was vaguely familiar. The riffs felt sinister and spooky in a way that reminded me of the slower Slayer albums (fitting, since Death covered Slayer's "Black Magic" in concert), not in terms of how they sound but rather how they made me feel. More than just heavy, it felt almost evil. At least, that's what I felt on my first listen. When listening again I feel like I found something new, a bit of a melancholic undertone to the music. I could be imagining that, i'm not really sure.

My only gripe is with the instrumental track Voice of the Soul. I have no problem with it being a softer track, in fact I welcome it, I just felt that this specific track was unfitting.


All in all, its my favorite kind of album: the kind that makes me want to go through the band's whole discography. 

Favorite original track off the album: Flesh and the Power it Holds
Anagnorisis' 'Peripeteia' - Really incredible black metal with a personal backstory about the frontman's father and their terrible relationship. The title track is stunning: http://music.anagnorisis.com/track/peripeteia
(Noob here slowly educating myself. Please to throw things at me if I use words incorrectly.) 

[Cross Vault - Miles to Take](https://soundcloud.com/iron-bonehead-productions/cross-vault-miles-to-take)

I like the instrumental parts of this but I don't dig the clean vocals. Feels kinda jarring to me, since the instrumental portions are pretty traditionally doom-y, some fuzz, layers, etc. I have a feeling that I'll like the vocals more as I keep listening to this, so I'll keep it in rotation.

[Trees of Eternity - Hour of the Nightingale](https://treesofeternity.bandcamp.com/album/hour-of-the-nightingale)

Bonus points for poetic album name. 'Melancholic' is the word for this album; it's sad, but the sort of sad that's gentle and almost comforting in a weird way. Minor tonality, a little fuzz, but enough memorable riffs to keep things interesting. (Although it's not quite the kind of album where you sit down and do nothing but listen to that. I confess to wandering attention halfway through when I tried.) Whispery lady vocals contrast just enough with the guitars/drums to feel otherworldly. 

[Dillinger Escape Plan - Calculating Infinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCmQN6nZz14)

I hear these guys have just released their final record! So naturally I'm gonna go listen to their first one. *rolls eyes* But, uh, TIL I really enjoy mathcore. (I'm gonna blame that one on a classical music background. I like figuring out how musical stuff fits together.) I don't love the vocals (a little too angsty? maybe I just had the wrong thing for lunch before I listened to it?) but since DEP changes singers after this album I think life will go on. This album has aged pretty well, especially considering how influential the internets says it has been. 

[Dream Theater - A Dramatic Turn of Events](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k9XiYku5Ck)

Somebody who knows things about things said that Dream Theater is important and you should listen to them. So off I skipped and now I'm not coming back from whatever alternate universe this is, cuz it's more interesting. I love how this album manages to be a coherent Thing while also doing a lot of different stuff in individual tracks. These dudes have a gift for melody, not to mention how tightly focused all the various instrumental parts feel. 

[After the Burial - Rareform](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw9S-Bzatjc) 

I know "deathcore" doesn't get much love in these parts. I hate the term to be honest. I don't think it accurately describes this particular genre. I've seen it referred to as "Djent" or progressive metal. I prefer the latter term. Regardless of how you define it this album is incredible from beginning to end. After the Burial came out at a time when I was just developing my preferences for metal. There were a slew of bands with a similar sound. Born of Osiris, Veil of Maya etc... I recently revisited a few of there inaugural albums and I found this album "Rareform" from After the Burial to be the only one that really withstood the test of time. The obvious appeal to the band is its insane execution of extremely complex open chord rhythmic chugging. The patterns they use on almost every song are elaborate and require extensive listening to really understand. It feels as if they beg to be listened to ad nauseum until they have been "solved". Beyond that though the lead melodies are as catchy as they are technical. Berserker is a very memorable track. Right out of the gates it opens with a melodic sweeping lead. The song develops into something much heavier with time signature transitions akin to Meshuggah. Cursing Akenaten draws heavily on a black metal influence without faltering from the bands signature mechanical sound. Aspiration is a genuinely unique piece of music. The opening chord progression has a very "pretty" ambient feel to it before thrusting you into another elaborate series of palm muted rhythmic patterns. In summary if this genre isn't "for you" I implore you to step outside your comfort zone and listen to this album with an open mind. 



Khemmis - Hunted

This album has been so refreshing for me. I'm at the point where a lot of music that comes out just comes across as stagnant and boring. I haven't listened to it a million times or anything of that nature but it always leaves me feeling better. I liken it to a cold drink of water on a hot day. You always take it for granted until you listen(drink) and then it's like "Damn, this is some good water(music)!"
[Necrophagist - Epitaph (2004)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BltsYTgU3Y&list=PL8NZHBp0dCnwONzsi6aXfARe8Dweoj_5a)

(I am unsure as to how to title the link, so hopefully what I posted beneath will suffice.) 
Necrophagist has been a super unit since the late 80s. They are German based, but have always reverted to english lyrics of which are written in sheer brutality. Super diverse tempos and melodic heavy riffs of which rarely repeat themselves. You will hear death metal renditions of original classical music for example; Necrophagists' song Only Ash Remains has a fitting sample of Sergei Prokofiev's Dance of the Knights. Whether you are a musician and can appreciate good tech, or someone who just loves to bludgeon brain cells with your horns up, these fellows will land on your favorites list. 
[Beaneath the Massacre - Evidence of Inequity EP (2005)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c43hnaAn0o&list=PL9028BB8CA219EE61)

Creative writing with sickening blasts and tappy riffs! Beneath the Massacre is based out of Quebec Canada. Don't let anyone tell you Canadians do not melt faces. Their style is quite different than most other death metal groups. They utilize some polyphonic riffs and tremolo in between hateful off-beat chugging. If the first song on this EP doesn't sell you, then maybe you're more of a death metal OG. Their approach on jams is definitely new school. Little hints of Egypt remind you of Nile, while some of their super fast riff lines and drumming will take you back to Origin. What is great about these guys, is they are a wonderful intro to intensely heavy death metal for those of you who would like to convince your girlfriends to head bang with you! Melodic, technical and heavy. Just the way I like it!
Just recently been exploring more Death Metal from Nile, Bolt Thrower, Dying Fetus, Immolation, Autopsy and deathgrind with Aborted. Also Dantesco, an epic doom metal band from my homeland of Puerto Rico. They have amazing stuff with incredible production. Most of their songs are in Spanish though but they started making some in English. Take a listen to "Carnifex" by them if you wanna check them out
BROTHERS OF THE SONIC CLOTH- LAVA

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JIl5qwQCCsE
 this deserves so much more attention.
I've been listen to a band that I just recently discovered called the Bloody Hammers a lot lately. They're not very heavy, they have a style that is similar to Black Sabbath but still sound unique, they do it really well. Aside from that, it's been nonstop Black Metal for weeks. Bathory, Satanic Warmaster, God Seed, Burzum, Dark Throne, Inquisition, etc..
[**Tempel of Baal - Mysterium**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98UrQzETmTM) **(2015)**

Beautifuly crafted Blackened Death from France. Loads of tremolo-picked riffs accompanied with unrelenting blast-beats and great vocal work.

[**The Black Dahlia Murder - Abysmal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cuw410YpZaE) **(2015)**

I don't think I have to say much here, it's a killer album and I recently got back in love with TBDM.

I've been listening to [King Giant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iyvrw7FBysM), a Southern Metal band. I'd never heard them until they came across a streaming music service. I'm really getting into their music.
Dissection - Nights Blood [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8c3L0bqUnao)

I have been listening to a lot of dissection. I recently found out that the band does not play anymore because the singer offed himself. This stuff is truly amazing and I was wondering if people know some similar sounding bands that are still around?
Entombed - wolverine blues
This album man, i don't know what it is about the guitar tone that gets me but it just does every single time 
I have been listen to a lot of Metal recently after a long hiatus and last night I remembered this great band called Psypheria I used to listen to back in high school. They're Technical DM done the right way, no technical wankery whatsoever, just the right amount along with sheer brutality and **really** sick keyboards.

They're are obviously influenced by Nocturnus but w/o the spacey vibe, more like being-chased-by-something-on-a-dungeon-or-some-shit-like-that vibe.

"[Cathartic Degeneration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsbDhtktoAs)" is my favourite track by them, although "[Flesh Must Burn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DYCSYhH-yg)" is a close second.

I really recommend listening to their album "Embrace The Mutation" in full. You won't be disappointed.
Nightfear.
I know I'm WAY late to the party, but Jester Race by In Flames. And I love it.

edit: I really need melody in my metal. I'm new to the whole metal scene, and mostly like Ensiferum, Wintersun, Amon Amarth, Equilibrium, Amorphis, and Dark Tranquillity. DT led me to In Flames, and so far I've heard two things about them: 1) Their new stuff sucks, and 2) Jester Race is a masterpiece. The first seconds of Moonshield made me smile - this is going to be good! His voice is a tad on the brutal side for me (it sounds more angry than melodic, for harsh vocals) but I really, really like the riffs, catchy lines, and overall flow of the songs. I'm only two listens in, but I listen whenever I can!
[removed]
UPON A BURNING BODY -  [Bring The Rain](https://youtu.be/Tbi1L2d8pBA) and the new album 'Straight from the Barrio' with songs like [Already Broken](https://youtu.be/YosAFMiIFRY).

I grew up liking Ill Niño and saw UABB at a festival with a bunch of Sumerian Records acts. I like their attitude and mix of spanish gangster badassery into their music.
Mastodon - Leviathan. It's so good. 
[removed]
Might get better luck posting to r/metalcore
Gonna keep checking this for a while and they don't take the stage until 10:30
7" had promise from what I remember. I'll have to try this when I get a chance.
Just saw them live last week and they were really good and energetic on stage.
AOTY contender.
I know this is really awful, but I finally listened to this album last week. It's been sitting on my ipod (yes, I still have one) for months and I only listened to it now.

I was very happy with the riffs. It was different than I was imagining, almost sounded like a death metal album. Anyways, it's a cool album that really does deserve more listens
Haven't seen a lot of talk about this album. One of the better BM records this year, in my booklet.
I really hope that they have the $100 presale tickets for Psycho California as well, because getting tickets for myself and my girlfriend at $200 for the weekend is way more doable than $500. 
This would be cool if general admission tickets weren't $250 + a $45 surcharge + tax. That's highway robbery.
Oooh, Swans.
I'm still bummed they moved it to Vegas, makes it way too expensive for me due to lodging. I'd love to see Swans, but at least I'll be seeing Neurosis next month. Interested to see what the final lineup looks like at least. 
Fantastic album. 
Yeah, that's the stuff.
Possibly the most mediocre band/project run by a label owner in the underground.   
If you want to get into 'cavernous death metal' but are having a hard time connecting - Grave Miasma is probably the best bet. At least that was my experience. Superset with Vastum if you need some help
Noooow this is a story, all about how, my life got twisted turned upside down. 

Now I'd like to take a minute and discuss the pain, that comes with receiving an Artificial Brain! 
saw these guys play a basement last year on my birthday. They fucking killed it. 
Wow didn't think we would see this until next year. They are killer live, excited to hear this. 
This was Robb Flynn and Phil Demmel of Machine Head's original band, right?
YES!!!!! One of my all time favorites!!
I really want to like grindcore.. I just find it so hard to distinguish between guitar riffs. Like, I can tell they're very skilled, and there is variation, it's just too damn fast and blurry for me to appreciate I guess.
hmm... guess I could've been in a band.
This is fucking tasty.  Thanks for sharing.
I really hope to catch this tour when it comes through my area.  This sounds great. 
Watched this like 10 times already. It's just so good.

Saw them at Nummirock and I think they changed the way I listen to music. Damn, they're good.
Oh yeah! Gonna see them when they come through Denver!
The quality of the recording is very good. I'm always a fan of well recorded black metal.
Wish I knew the euro support. On the fence about the Dublin show.
Kind of disappointed they're not coming to Belgium, but this recording looks and sounds damn good!
Oh man, that is some quality drumming. Great recording. 
Classic!!!!!  I love this tune!!!!
Metal Church is always welcome.
Fuck yes.
START THE FIRE!
I have to say, this album was a big step down for me for Symphony X. Don't get me wrong, there's still a ton of great material, but it's their most generic album by far. That being said, my favorite album of theirs is Twilight in Olympus so I probably don't know what I'm talking about.
I really love this album. Just recently took a closer listen to the last song on the album, and I have to say I'm impressed.

This track on the other hand, is cheesy melodeath and probably the worst of the whole album. The breakdown in the middle of the song is pretty embarrassing, and the solo after it is outright hilarious. The solo guitar still creates an interesting earworm, probably the only saving grace of this track.
Love me some Intestine Baalism
Their only good album, as far as I'm concerned. Bit too far away from the death metal sound and into In Flames' after this one. 
...still bummed the summer U.S. tour was cancelled.

So, a while ago someone [asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/5as9h9/how_do_you_discover_new_bands/d9jpbg3/?context=3) how people look for new metal. I saw that way late and my comment got totally burried. I expected it, I warned myself, but I still put some effort into it, because it's kind of my thing. So let me copypaste the whole thing here, maybe you guys like to check it out anyway.

-----------------------------------


**Spotify** has a playlist with [new metal](https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/4UIvC4UYUecnpWkHCMRlri). Don't get too excited: It's not very good, because it's filled to the brim with new metalcore. They should really call it 'new metalcore'. BUT they do follow all the big names and you'll never miss one of those. Also, be sure to follow every single band you like on Spotify (this probably all goes for Google Play, Tidal and Apple Music as well), so you'll get updates on them. That system is kinda flawed to, because it can take up to a week before you'll finally get that update. But it doesn't take a lot of effort to bang that follow button and with enough listening hours under your belt and lots of follows, Spotify does gives some love back in your personal Release Radar playlist, the Discover Weekly playlist, the discovery function in general and in the Daily Mix playlists you'll somehow only find on mobile (goddamn it Spotify, that's another flaw). You'll get suggestions on your own playlists now, too, and if you're lazy just hit up on an artists radio station. If you're still in the dark, follow [my fucking playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/pvdp/playlist/7s2xt5dCX0e5S4Om9vyHKg) of awesome new, underground metal. 


**Bandcamp** is a great way to follow artists, especially the ones that are not on Spotify or the other streamers. You'll not only get emails when they release something new, but also when they have a new shirt or patch to sell. This is especially fine if you figured out what labels release music you like. You can even get a subscription for the labels you *really* like. Those are usually dirt cheap, so you can't go wrong, but obviously only with smaller labels who release some kind of crazy niche you like. I have [this](https://bandcamp.com/?g=metal&s=top&f=all#discover) in a button on my bookmarks toolbar, which I just hit whenever I casually wonder if something new came out (alright, rabidly, and ten times every fucking day).


**Facebook**. Oh yeah, there's a lot wrong with Facebook. Their algorhythms are less predictable than Ulcerate's. But it's a good way to follow bands, labels and promoters. There are also some nice groups you could join, czech out your local metalhead groups (sorry). There are groups for black metal nerds, heavy vinyl nerds, death metal nerds, metalcore nerds, dungeonsynth nerds, there's groups of warm nerds huddling around everywhere. You can also try to follow some people (musicians, journalists etc) in the know: some, not all, have their follow function on, so you don't have to act like a crazy stalker and friend them out of nowhere (journalists are people too!), and get their public updates. 


**Blogs**. I don't really know about most genres, I'll admit. But metal has some of the best blogs I know. Some of them are unbelievably good in finding new stuff. *If* Jon Rosenthal taps anywhere near your tastes, I would almost say it's enough to just follow the monday's new releases posts on [Invisible Oranges](http://www.invisibleoranges.com/upcoming-metal-releases-10302016-1152016/). The monthly feature on Stereogum, [The Black Market](http://www.stereogum.com/category/franchises/the-black-market/) is very, very good (and foreward thinking), and The Quietus has a nice [monthly round up](http://thequietus.com/features/columnus-metallicus) as well.  You can't go without [NoCleanSinging](http://www.nocleansinging.com/) (cool premieres), [Cvlt Nation](http://www.cvltnation.com/) (cool but kinda scary premieres), [Decibel](http://decibelmagazine.com/) (big release talk, interviews, some premieres) and [HeavyBlogisHeavy](http://www.heavyblogisheavy.com/) (cool prog reviews) either. For reviews, I take none above [AngryMetalGuy](http://www.angrymetalguy.com/). And other than most people here, I do like to read the metal people on [Pitchfork](http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/?genre=metal). Especially in combination with all of the above. My own new-shit-thing is on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/metaltotheteeth/) and, recently, here on [r/metal as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/search?q=%5BFresh+Metal%5D+author%3Asomethingoverthere&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all).


**Twitter**. That's a difficult one. I used to be absolutely addicted to it, and in the last couple of years it was great for new metal as well. I started to dislike the atmosphere there though, and left a couple of months ago (I didnt delete my 7000+ followers account, I'm not an idiot, I just stopped participating). BUT it's a nice place to use kind of as an rss feed, to just get metal news, blogs, reviews and random burps from metal-twitter. Follow the big name journalists, the blogs, musicians and some bands and artists.


**Reddit**. Like many people said, check out this sub, but don't stop there. Find your niche and indulge in it's sub. Most subs aren't the best place to find new releases, but you'll find releases that are new to you.


**Friends**. Fine, I'm kidding.
#End of the Year Predictions 

End of the year is just around the corner and something I always like to do is to draft a list or at least a handful of records that are sure to be on big name publications and blogs. 

**Top Bet (Album that will be seen everywhere)**

* **Metallica - Hardwired** - Even my perphery metal freinds are asking me about this saying that it sounds like old Metallica. It is a double record from a band that is universally known. Despite having terrible album art, this is my prediction for taking up the most amount of slots on the most amount of lists. 

**Sure Bets**

* Meshuggah - The Violent Sleep of Reason
* Gojira - Magma 
* Opeth - Sorceress
* Gorguts - Pleiades' Dust (Special award for being an EP)
* Ihsahn - Arktis
* Babymetal - Metal Resistance (Either #1 or #10 on lists with a paragraph of explanation regarding the old metal guard)
* Amon Amarth - Jomsviking 
* Fleshgod Apocalypse - King








**The Underground Nod**

Something that is interesting at the end of the year is seeing a list of pretty expected records with a random underground favorite thrown in for good measure. These are smaller records that experienced a surge in popularity on a larger stage. These are also records that can be used to legitimize an otherwise ordinary list. If Bolzer is at 7, then people wont mind if Opeth is at 1. 

* Sumerlands - Sumerlands 
* Saor - Guardians 
* Vektor - Terminal Redux
* Allegaeon - Proponent For Sentience (Stop killing metal)
* Trees Of Eternity - Hour Of The Nightingale (recent passing of the singer might mimic Woods of Ypres fame) 

**Album that was a big deal when it was released but probably wont get any attention even from its fans.** 

* Insomnium - Winter's Gate
* Megadeth - Dystopia 

-----

Met a kid at the Dark Tranquility show who was fresh into metal. It was fun seeing him have an open mind and take in all the recs I threw at him. Invited him to join r/metal so this post is mostly for him if he bothered to make a reddit account. 
I had a minor Bathory revelation the other day. Previously I've stated that while they are important, the music never clicked for me. 

After listening to the Cvlt Nation Bathory s/t cover album, I went back and listened to the real thing. To my surprise I ended up enjoying it a lot more than before. No idea why that's the case, but there you go. I'm going to work my way through their discography proper and see what happens. 

Can we chill out with the amount of Metallica threads? The album hasn't even been released and we've seen about five. I get that Metallica is your favorite band but there are so many albums worthy of discussion this year and constantly talking about Metallica pushes them out. This is /r/metal, we have a whole genre to discuss.  
What is your black metal AOTY?

The more I spin Condemnation by Antaeus, the more I'm convinced it's by far my favourite BM album of this year. It feels like the missing link between DPE and Blood Libels.
What is the most popular ***metal*** band you listen to that was formed after the turn of the century?

EDIT: I ask this question primarily because it seems like a lot of the best bands from modern times are buried in obscurity so I am curious which are the more popular bands that are listened to by the veteran users here.
To those of you in bands: have youse ever bumped into someone in the street wearing your merch? Or pulled up at the lights and heard another car playing your music? 
What are Shreddit's thoughts on Tool? I'm planning to explore their music. Gonna buy Undertow, Aenima, and Lateralus. 
About ten years ago in Sweden there seemed to be a new scene forming that consisted of a bunch of old school worshipping death metal bands. 

They came from all over the country but just as soon as the scene popped up it seemed to die out with a lot of the bands only releasing a demo or two before splitting for good. Some stuck around and released albums. I was wondering if there was any interest here in a possible thread about said bands with links to their stuff?

I bought a lot of tapes and went to a lot of gigs at the time, was some of the most fun I've had.
Do you guys think I am missing an important part of the experience if I don't read the lyrics?

 I find it time consuming to read the lyrics while listening to death and black metal. I could be doing something else while listening. 

At the same time, I'm really interested to know what the lyrics are about but I know I'll never be able to know what is being said since English isn't my first language. I imagine it's still difficult for English speaking people too when it comes to extreme metal. 
Saw the Carcass/Deafheaven tour last weekend. Deafheaven had a really good live sound, but man that is one goofy, odd band. The guitar players eventually got into a groove, but for the first two songs were playing off rhythm with each other, meaning that the tremolos from the guitars were seemingly in opposition to each other, making the music sound more like Deathspell or something. They eventually figured it out, although I think moving to one side of the room and getting mostly one guitar helped. This could also explain why the guys spend every in-between bitching at the sound board.

Their singer is like you took the guy from Eighteen Visions and crossed him with Jonathan Davis cir. 1997. A complete goof who moves his hands like he's conducting...

Carcass at this point is a legacy band, and don't let the new album confuse you. As such, I had a great time holding my beer in the air during "Heartwork" and "No Love Lost." They did some medleys of the first-two albums that isolated mostly the mid-tempo riffs, so that was... on the brighter side, after seeing people carrying open beers through the pit area several times, I was treated to seeing someone lose about 30 bucks worth of drinks as they haphazardly avoided the periodic moshing that happened to spring up as the guy walked across the floor. He took it pretty well, I thought.
Hey I don't know if you guys have discussed this yet, but I've listened to about half of the **Bolzer** album so far and I'm *very disappointed*. 

I feel like they've pulled a Mastodon on us, where the vocals get so watered down to the point that the music is also watered down. It feels liks Bolzer has neutered themselves, and I can't even figure out why. 

Anyways, pretty disappointed in that album. All that hype over the years, and this is what we got. Thoughts?
After almost 3 semesters of liberal arts education, I've collected a modest list of excellent band names and song/album titles from the classic books we read and the discussions we have on them. The list is as follows:

* A Sleep of Iron (Virgil, *Aeneid*, X.1045)

* The Duel of Mars (Virgil, *Aeneid*, XII. 1068)

* The Stronger Must Prevail (Pascal, *On the Equilibrium of Liquids*)

* The Punishment of Mettius (Livy, *The Rise of Rome*, I.28)(It's absolutely brutal, he was torn apart by the limbs by four teams of horses)

* Violent Usurpation (Livy, *The Rise of Rome*, I.49)

* Our Flesh Will Rise (For Immortality) (St. Augustine, *The Spirit And the Letter*)

* Atomic Anaxamander (the nickname bestowed by my class upon the pre-Socratic philosopher Heraclitus, whose writings are like of those of another pre-Socratic, Anaxamander, combined with atomic theory)

* Mercurial Dephlogistication (based on some experiments done in support of the old Phlogiston theory)

* Future More Vivid (With Emphatic Protasis) (A Latin syntactical term)

* Rhotacism of the Intervocalic "S" (A Latin morphological term)

* Reductio ad Absurdum (A line of argument that takes up one or more alternate possibilities and shows them to reach absurd conclusions, eliminating impossibilities until the truth is reached)

There's probably some I'm missing but that's all I've written down so far.

MEGA EDIT: Also, last year when I was writing a paper, I got so bored at one point that I translated my thesis statement into death metal English just for kicks. Here it is (bonus points if anyone can translate it back): **THE ERRONIOUS PROCLAMATION OF THE WARRIOR SON OF ATREUS HATH BEEN SUFFICIENTLY PROVEN UNTO UTTER DESPAIR-ROOTED FALSEHOOD BY THE OBSERVATIONS OF PROLONGED DEITEIAL SORROW AND THE PARTAKING OF PLEASURE-RIDDEN MORTAL DELUSIONS WHICH HATH BEEN THE APEX OF DIVINE EXPLOITS PERPETRATED BY THE PANTHEON OF OLYMPIAN IMMORTALS**

Went to a small show with a bunch of local death metal bands opening , and the main act was sort of progressive black/death. They were amazing, but only 6 people stayed near the stage. Seriously don't get why Americans aren't interested in this music. (I live in the wrong country lol) But I will admit Napalm Death and BDM were playing the same night, which sucked for them.
I'm interested in how black metal has evolved over the years. Because of recommendations, I've been listening to Bathory's first for the past couple weeks off and on, and I don't have the historical perspective to hear this as "black metal", at least compared to modern black which is (or at least seems to be) very much focused on tremolo picking and blast beats.

Comparatively, I've also been listening a lot to Cobalt's newest, Slow Forever (which is fucking amazing), and it doesn't feel very "black metal" either. Gin, yes, but Slow Forever? Reminds me more of a thrashy/punky/'sub-genre I don't know the name of' metal. Is it an artifact of their history that the album is considered black metal? Or am I just not well-versed enough in the full range of the genre to hear it on this record?

Additionally, Oranssi Pazuzu's Varahtelija is black metal, but it doesn't feel as "black metal" as Mgla's Exercises in Futility or Emperor's In The Nightside Eclipse. Same with Deathspell Omega's The Synarchy of Molten Bones.

Anyone have a primer or intro to black metal to help me out? 
I've been coming here for probably 8 years now, (with various accounts that have long since been deleted)

We have some pretty talented writers here, with some, writing about music being their main hobby or even their job, and that's awesome.   I've thought of participating more myself, especially in WHYBLT threads, etc, but I have **no idea how to talk about music**.

I like what I like and I don't know why I like it, but I think I would like to figure that out, and maybe even articulate it sometimes. 

How did you figure out what you like, or why you like it?  How do you dissect music and judge it by its parts?

I don't expect anyone here to care, but I'm seeing Disturbed in 2 days. They were my favourite band for a few years from when I was 11, and I've always liked them since so I'm pretty excited to finally see them live.  
Devilskin is opening for them too, which is cool because I'm on the fence about buying tickets to their show so this is a perfect test run. 
Albums from bands you don't like or even hate that you like?
As of right now, it looks like if I were to make an honest top 5 or even 10 for this year, it would only include Metal. Theres a lot of stuff I still have to listen in other genres, but god damn metal has had a good year.

One that has snuck in on the list so far is Fyrnask - Forn, I've never heard any of their stuff before and it blew me away, such an interesting Black Metal album.
Seeing Entombed AD and Voivod tomorrow 
So what's the deal with Dave Mustaine? I heard he's Xenophobic or something. Is this true?
You ever have that song that you know sucks but you just love it for some reason anyways? I'm having that with [Judas Priest's cover of Johnny B. Goode] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9YlTBEBwIQ) right now. I picked up Ram It Down on Amazon for quite literally a dollar (mostly for that juicy solo in the title track); absolute cheeseball of a record, but you better believe that I've had that Johnny B. Goode chorus stuck in my head for a few weeks now. I dunno, maybe I should get my head checked out or something. 
What are your favorite heavy metal (as in, traditional metal, not any fucking thing you want to say) albums from this year? Gotta go with Demon Bitch, Tarot, Lethal Steel, Ravensire, and Sumerlands so far, personally.

What are your favorite blues rock and heavy psych albums this year? I have absolutely none, which is a step down from last year's Graveyard, Kadavar, The Devil and the Almighty Blues, and Golden Void albums. 
I've been digging around on Bandcamp a whole lot lately and I'm kinda curious and a little confused about why some bands are labeled the way they are. Bands like Dynatron, Gost, Master Boot Record, and Perturbator are coming up under the black metal tags. Is that stuff considered black metal now or is it just labeled as such because they believe black metal fans are interested in it? Not trying to start some kind of genre argument, I'm just wondering.  I mean, I don't think it's bad or anything, I actually picked up the digital download of Dynatron's "The Rigel Axiom" and it's fun. Which leads me to believe that they're labeled that way because of a perceived overlap of interest, but who knows?

What is the worst album of 2016 that you've heard?

I listened to the new Anagnorisis album earlier out of curiosity, and wow. I found myself physically cringing. They have blurred the lines between black metal and emo in ways I never imagined. The samples of the little kid talking, the younger version of the singer, felt more offensive to me than any post-black I have ever heard before. If you thought Deafheaven was bad then I challenge you to listen to this. FFO: Brand New and feels. 0/10

On a side note, I have been attempting to get into Uskumgallu and other Vrasubatlat but am not really getting it. I'm a fan of Urzeit, and Triumvir Foul was decent enough, I just haven't found enough redeeming qualities to want to keep coming back. If Uskumgallu is high on your list, what about it stands out for you?
Who else is coming to Hellfest for the 2017 edition?
Thanks to all the uploaders for populating Youtube with new stuff to discover... it's a good evenings entertainment reading the mouthbreathers sperge in the comments while taking in some new tunes
Has anyone listened to the new Trees of Eternity album? How was it?
So I just found the band Iskra the other day, and on their website they have free downloads of all their music. [Link](http://iskracrust.com/front.html) But I'm a little hesitant because the download is from mediafire, and when you click to download the webpage redirects to what looks like malware popups, but the download does begin. The file sizes are also 480mb which seem really big. Can anyone tell me if these files are safe to download?
What's the most evil sounding album in your opinion? 

For me, few things come close to Dawn of Possession by Immolation. The deep growls, dissonant downtuned riffs and pinch harmonics make it actually sound diabolical. 
If anyone is interested I have a plug dj room for black metal. Ive found more black metal in the past few days since posting it on /r/blackmetal than I have in months

This'll be kind of a weird question but let's see what happens. I'm extraordinarily neurotic about making lists of new releases and filing them into listening lists on their release date, but I noticed a few weeks ago that *Arctic Thunder* had completely disappeared from my lists. I'm thinking that that release date (Oct. 14th) might have gotten deleted instead of copied, and now I'm worried that there might be other releases from that date that might also have disappeared. So... anyone know what other albums came out on October 14th? Or anywhere I could look that information up?
So I was minding my own business listening to shuffle on spotify and it decided to kick my ass for nearly 2 hours with a frankly fantastic playlist. I assume that it bugged out because it repeatedly focused on certain artists (notably Secret Chiefs 3).

Has anybody else experienced this?
[playlist here](https://open.spotify.com/user/crazyslice/playlist/6xpzfiw1BpcHu3jgbatrUb)
So... How about them Hail Spirit Noir? I've given the new album a few spins now and it really clicked today. I like just about every song on there, and there's a good chance it'll end up on my top 10 list for the year.
Testament's new album, "Brotherhood of the Snake", is not getting nearly enough love or attention. This is easily their best album since "The Gathering". Awesome riffs throughout the album, and Chuck proves once again that he's still the best old school thrash vocalist still going today.
For anyone who was in that Metallica thread yesterday here's my personal review of Hardwired... to Self Destruct:

**it fucking sucked**
Woah, is Travis Ryan from Cattle Decapitation the vocalist for Anal Trump?
Found this name-your-price compilation of the first two demos and two bonus live tracks on Autopsy's bandcamp over [here](https://autopsy.bandcamp.com/album/ridden-with-disease). There's also a live album from 2004.
Dat Windows Movie Maker intro.

I could never really get into Nevermore, but I kinda dig this. I might have to give them another shot, this is groovy stuff. 
I miss this band so much 
Their demo comp is absolutely killer.
Haha the band Nirvana always throws me off for a second. But on a  serious note, Internment fucking kills!
RIP BETTER DRUDKH
THRASH SONG OF THE YEAR

IIII SAWWWW THE DEVILLLL

LURKINGGGG

WITHIN MYSELFFFF!
This is some tasty thrash, I'm going to give the whole album a listen. 
nice to here some auzzy metal from downunder just like metal masters parkway drive \m/
They need to work on their album art.
Daddy likey.
THAT FUCKING RIFF THO. 
I like thrash metal.
Have this album somewhere. Didn't like it before but I'll check it out again.
One of the few Deris-era songs I like.
Love this Fuckin song.

Can pungent stench be underrated?
Ah it's been too long since I listened to this band, thanks for the link.
How many did they make??
If you liked this, I definitely think you should checkout the song "Carnifex" from them. That one is in English
💯 💯 💯 💯 💯 💯
Man, I guess I'm the only one here who thinks this Nails cut rules.
Nails got embarrassed on this split. 
cant wait to see Full of Hell... who needs entombed ad anyways :P
Very fortunate to have seen them both when they toured together, unreal show 
Full of Hell only gets better with each release they put out. I'm MOIST WITH ANTICIPATION for their next LP.
Ordered this on vinyl, and trying to wait for it to arrive before listening.

Glad Nails is back together, and that they will be playing Power of the Riff fest next month... Awesome lineup.

http://www.thepoweroftheriff.com/
Nails was so weak on this. Full of hell killed it as always

The day I discovered Full of Hell they we're playing a 15 minute drive from my house, why I didn't go watch them is beyond me. Hopefully they'll come back sometime soon.

I have no idea why, but I'm pretty sure that Al-Namrood was the first black metal band that I've ever heard. I wasn't even into BM at the time, I just saw them mentioned on a YouTube video and decided to go a little deeper. I thought they were really good but haven't listened to them since. 
I love this EP, especially this song. I got several downvotes immediately when I posted it awhile back glad to see somebody else likes it.
Favorite song off this album, they played it live when i saw them earlier this year was awesome 
Thank you for this. Have anymore thrash like this?

Really reflective of modern times and the failure of the state.
I love this band...but I'm a sucker for almost any Black/Speed. These guys also did my favorite cover of my favorite Bathory song, Witchcraft. EDIT: wait no, Morbid Slaughter did it best...
Great album. Might be top 10 for me. 
Seeing them tonight. Going to be an ethereal experience.
2:52 is a great part of the song
He's not wrong.
I'd argue that in some regions anti-Christianity is still apt. Namely the Southern US. It's still an ever-present part of the culture, at the expense of quality of life for non-believers.

That being said, attacking Christianity in the typical way, with blasphemy, has become old-hat and the focus needs to be more on attacking the culture that has sprung up and thrived in the wasteland of anti-individualism and anti-intellectualism that it's left in its wake.
I like how that's the title of the interview, but it was more like a side-comment rather than the theme of the interview...
It's still fun though
I thought the more interesting bit was when he discussed merging atmoblack with elements of the more aggressive Dissection-like style. There is an unfortunate tendency for your average atmoblack bands to err towards dull, safe melodies and song structures making for a bad reputation overall that I would have to agree with, despite the sub-genre having a massive concentration of my favorite bands.
Should be more relevant than ever. Still the bit about Satan being a gimmick, that's absolutely true, and would be more true sentence to quote than the sentence after it (This headline).


Well, the evangelicals eventually wised up and realized that, by picketing shows and accusing bands of sneaking in subliminal messages, they're just drawing more attention to the music they hate. So, most of them are just silently ignoring metal, which is what they should have done in the first place. There hasn't been a metal act who caused major controversy in America since Marilyn Manson.
I was thinking about this the other day. When everything is rebellious or controversial in the end, nothing is really rebellious or controversial. 
[deleted]
I mean, in all fairness, bands have been doing it for 30+ years, so of course it's gonna get old pretty soon.
I thought the theme of black metal was just being depressed in a snowy forest now.
Does it have to be? 
I'm about to jump off an Ayreon cliff for a month or so.
Can't wait for the upcoming album!
My all time favorite music project, all albums by Ayreon are very different and amazing
Damn that's some good stuff. Have every album, plus a signed copy of  The Gathering Storm, with a t-shirt. It's my favorite shirt lol.
Really enjoyed that, thanks for posting it!
New shit, Lombardo on drums, [full album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8orOzoaUC0), [wikipedia about the album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Gone_Mad)
Been on a massive Dismember kick lately, mostly *Like An Everflowing Stream* though. These guys can riff and have possibly the best guitar tone in swedeath. 
Awesome album, awesome cover art. Currently my computer wallpaper. Gives me a Warhammer vibe, ya dig?
tons of melody on this record. i remember buying the cassette in 1997 or 1998. death metal was no longer dangerous then but dismember always kept it cool and discharge-y.
ah, one of my favorites from one of my favorite bands 
I am pretty sure that either Ron Jarzombek or Devin Townsend are god.
Absolutely crushing. Consider me hyped for the full-length.
This band translates better live for me, saw them last night and they were great.
One of the very, very few modern crossover bands. New material is extremely welcome. 
Fuck yeah
That main riff is so fucking good.

Always looking for more speed metal.
I get the feeling that she's done with the band now that the leggings thing has taken off.
I'm loving this album
Nice album. Furia will have a live album coming out next spring as well. 
This new album does seem more mellow than their other releases, I think.
Thank you! I love hearing metal in different languages, and this music is bad ass! 
[Brought to my attention](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/51wzd6/promote_tell_us_about_your_band/d7flv94/) in one of the self promotion threads a couple months ago.

[The whole LP is fukn great.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_VhUkYqWls).

Can't wait to hear more of them. 
This I like.
C'est genial! Comme une album de Maiden avec Di'Anno. En francais ca ce fait!
Bought this beauty on vinyl a few days ago and can finally cross it off my want list. I love this EP so much, it's so special to me.
Sums up the power and melody of 80s metal in one 4-minute package.
Found these guys last week lol. They rule 
Chuck Schuldiner's favorite band. they're awesome
forever known as chuck schuldiner's favorite band thanks to wikipedia.
Such a weird band, make sure you check out their new stuff too.
Did this get no traction when it came out in 2014? I'm really digging this.
Pretty good, and I *really* dig the cover art.
I'm not sure I've heard better Adramelech worship than this.
I can see this working the same way as Avantasia shows work: singers come and go off stage according to the songs they are playing.
I have dreamed of this for 12 years, since I first heard the Keepers albums. *Dreamed* of this. Never thought it was possible.

I'm shaking with happiness. Shrieked when I found out, like a boyband fangirl. The dream is real.

And in case anyone hasn't been obsessively following every single step of Kiske's career and buying every album he's graced, yes, he can still hit every single note. Flawlessly.
This could be sick, or it could be terrible. Either way if Kai's gonna be on vocals for any of it, doing stuff off the EP and Walls, then I'm sold.
Did not see that coming. 
Including Hansen, Kiske.....and Weikath ? I wanna have hope....
Realistically, what can we expect for any U.S. leg?  Two cities in California and that's it?  One east coast and one west coast date?  Or maybe at least a few cities across the country?

Hopefully they'll at least come to NYC like Avantasia did which will make the show doable for me.
I'm so fucking hyped!
Candlemass has done shows with all their singers. A tour though, that's somethin'! 
I'll be jumping on this, no doubt. Not that I really know much of the newer side of the band or how they changed with new members and all that.
It's happening!!!
Damn. Keepers I and II were my first power metal albums, and Walls of Jericho is one of my favorite speed metal albums. Beyond psyched.
I haven't been this happy and hopeful for the future since they announced Spider-Man coming to the MCU. That includes my kid being born.
Dare I hold an inkling of hope for a show even somewhat close to North Carolina?
This is great, I've been wishing Helloween would drop all the Keepers stuff for years. Now at least I'll be able to see Helloween with Deris singing more of his own material, and everyone who wants to hear the old stuff can hear that sounding right.
Helloween is one of my few remaining bucket list bands. I rarely listen to them these days but I sure as hell hope they're playing near me. 
Made the trek to see them in a tiny club in NYC in '99.... Will do whatever it takes to see them again. HUGE Kiske fanboy here.
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
This will be even better than Wacken 2011 was!  That year, Helloween played with Andy.  Kai and Micheal played later when Avantasia took stage.  As someone who really likes Helloween, that was just killer, but this is going to be fucking awesome too.
I'll probably be there if it comes close and isn't too expensive.
I'm glad people are getting psyched for one of my favorite bands but I have no doubt they'll skip over my area.

So I guess this means we shouldn't expect a new helloween, unisonic or Gamma ray album in the near future.
Ah, mass produced, cheap, psuedo-edgy power metal. Absolutely pathetic. Enjoy your long hair euro wannabe rocco siffredi chugging the E string of his overpriced strat with humbuckers like 0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0 while the goofy looking lead singer with enough hair grease to drown a small animal wails on about dragons fucking ponies or some gay shit like that.



Me? Now *I* prefer some quality metal. Burzum and Bathory with a side or Candlemass will do it for me. But by all means, keep upvoting your trash flower metal. Helps me distinguish the smart people on this sub from the degenerates. 
Anyone have any topping requests for the popcorn? 
This and "May the Hammer Smash the Cross" are two of my favourite Polish BM albums of all time. Good song pick too.

> Slaves of addictions, money and faith

> Cowards and morons, creatures without honour

The best Tormentor song although I have a feeling it was posted quite recently...

The Dissection cover on the Nordic Metal tribute album is great too. 
THIS IS A STORY ABOUT ELISABET BATHORY  

HER BLOOD IS OURSELVES, CLEAN HUNGARIAN BLOOD  
I prefer ghost's song about Elizabeth bathory
FFO: Insect Warfare

I love this band
is this Danny Walkers first band?
I got Serenity Through Warfare as a $4 blind buy at a record store that had almost everything  else overpriced as fuck. 
Guys and girls what if you realy wanted Iron Maiden but could only find the Russian knockoff version in some shady open air market?  Sure it looks weird and it is probably sold by some [fucked up looking elephant](http://i.imgur.com/4LRKR.jpg) but there is a charm in its quest to be an imitation but embraces its uniqueness. What if you bought into this and the whole thing was pretty amazing and you didn't care because you found the whole sound kinda came together into something fresh and unique just buried by time? Do you want to complete this transaction comrade? 

Aria would not be welcome on our Underground Friday. In fact, Aria is worth a little over 11 Batushkas if we are illustrating this math problem with Russian metal bands. For however much you do not know what you are listening to, there are legions of people who either found this or probably just grew up with this sound. If you travel back through this band's 80's records, you will not only find albums dense with quality but they are bannered by some amazing album art full of mystery and wonder. 

I have a passion for bands and artists who sing in their native tongue. It is interesting to hear how other languages sound when run through machine of popular music. This can lead to some idiosyncratic wonders that either try to replicate western pop music or meet somewhere in between. Ariya's translated lyrics are pretty typical with this album being heavily concerned with biblical themes. The delivery however with the original language is delivered with such gruff style and grace over instrumentation that is near flawless in its delivery. 

Why are you listening to this today? Well to be honest, because you are going to be impressed if this is your first time hearing it. If you are not satisfied, you can always try returning it to the open air market and asking for your money but the big scary Russian guy smoking cigarettes and glaring at you might persuade you to just be happy with it. Also think in a couple of years, you will be able to say that you grew up with something that other people have only had [fever dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ayfic62fDrA) about. 
Listening to it now, so are these guys like Russian Iron Maiden or something?
Interesting choice to say the least, but I'm glad at this pick. Aria are stalwarts in the Russian metal scene and virtually unknown outside the country, but they've made a lot of great Iron Maiden-esque trad metal. One of the best bands from the Soviet era (I like Kruiz more though).

EDIT: Also, Игра с огнём is probably my fav from them.
This was really fun. I'll be listening to them again and checking out Kruiz too
I know I've run into these guys a couple of times here, but never really dug in.

Fuck this album is so good.
Damn, that's a pleasant surprise.
Aria is absolutely fantastic, as were many of the fairly unknown (outside of Russia) metal bands of the time period- at least that I've heard. Anyone want to recommend me some more? I have some other big names, but aside from those, Aspid, and Кредо, I'm a bit spotty. Figure even if I get repeats that I already have other people can use the reccs :) 
Thanks, you reminded me that I should listen to more than just Мания Величия (AMAZING debut, by the way).

Will definitely be giving this a few spins. 
Oh hell yes. This is my favorite Ария album, and one of my favorite non-English trad albums as a whole.

I cannot think of a more deserving album this week.
Wow.. This is an absolutely excellent pick! I've never heard this album before and I just listened to it twice today at work I enjoyed it so much. Damn good choice.
I discovered Aria while browsing the world music section at Borders ages ago. Baptism By Fire had an awesome cover, so I took a chance on it and it was a very good gamble. The downside was, I had no idea how to look for more. I didn't know how type the Russian characters to google them and didn't know anyone who could read it. 

Bonus: that world music section also got me another great gamble with Mago de Oz. Its totally worth checking those sections out.
Прощай, Норфолк intro sounds exactly like Only The Good Die Young
Great choice for AOTW. Aria is one of the most iconic Russian metal bands and this is probably their best album. Все что было was one of my favourite karaoke choices when I lived in St Petersburg, just anthemic. Hair-raising vocals from Valeri Kipelov (who's a very accomplished singer) around 3:30. How can you not sing along to this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRbdaRP1IcI

Edit: Title track is just incredible too. Up there with the best 80s Maiden epics, including marching bass lines and gorgeous twin guitar leads. Really a classic trad album all around.
Fuck I love this album and band. I got into this band after I started learning Russian. Wanted to find Russian metal bands to immerse myself more into the language.
When I was studying Russian Aria was one of the bands I listened to trying to immerse myself in the language. Suffice the say I can't speak a single word of Russian but I sure do like Aria! 

Their new live album Classical Aria (Классическая Ария) has some of my favourite renditions of some of their classics. While I like the original recording of Torero the live performance [with an orchestra](https://youtu.be/RtVA0tU2A2Q?t=1h20m33s) is now my absolute favourite.
i am not understanding a word off this album, but i am enjoying it. nice recommend!
every metalhead i've spoken to in russia absolutely hates this band. they see them as a cheap knockoff of iron maiden. 
The greatest black metal band of all time. Hands down.
So just real quick on how I am judging restricted bands, atleast ones with deep discographies. As long as the song isn't in a bands top 20 

http://www.last.fm/music/Bathory/+tracks?date_preset=ALL

It is usually fine. For bands with one or two albums, well, we need to just use some duct tape and ingenuity to figure that one out. 
If you can, listen to the original vinyl version of this album. The remasters of Bathory and Under the Sign of the Black Mark sound different, but not necessarily better or worse. The Return on the other hand sounds way better in the original format, especially the bass drums.
Listened to the s/t and Under the Sign of the Black Mark so far for NBBMN. Guess I'll be listening to The Return..... as well.
Everyone posting pics of the super moon got me thinking about this album.   
Vasemman... is the best.
I would quite like to see these guys live... Hopefully someday.
I never paid much attention to them before Värähtelijä, but it got me to check out their back catalog and find their split with Candy Cane, which is also fucking amazing.
Song title is translated sprigbone, if someone is interested
This has got my vote for album of the year.
Torilla tavataan
Metal Blade signs quality bands more often than not, I'll have to check these guys out.
Okay, so Metal Blade has Revocation, Evocation... next is Vocation and so forth.
Great news.   Evocation is *very* underrated. 
They've got a second album out recently. Physical release coming soon.
Oh hey, a local band. 
I've been listening to this album a lot lately. It's really fun.
These guys sound like they should be touring with CKY.

Ugh. They're going to change their name, get a good producer, and sell 15 million albums. Shoot me.
I like the band but this was disappointing. Don’t think I hold much hope for the full release, unless something changes my mind.

That’s a nice album cover though.
I see you're giving examples from that Mare Cognitum thread. 

Reading the titles on this album bring up a lot of interesting thoughts. When I see song titles about murdering Jesus or raping the virgin, I don't bat an eyelash. Then I see these and I get sensitive, even though I'm very critical of Islam. I see no distinction between the two other than that it is far more acceptable where I live to criticize Christianity than it is to criticize Islam. Thanks for posting something to get me thinking.
I wasn't really into this album.  Not even based on the themes, I just don't think they did a very good job with the songwriting.  I would definitely rather hit Svolder or Ayat.
Meh
This is a really great album. Right up there with the best black metal this year, imo.
Still relevant, especially in the current political and social climate. 
Operation: Mindcrime is one of my all time favorite concept albums. Even their new stuff (band minus Tate) is great.
Geoff Tate's vocals on that album were insane.
I bet they were absolute murder on his throat. 
That whole album is a prog masterpiece. 
One of the best albums ever made.  Me and my friends got super stoned and listened to it in our hotel room at California Deathfest and just nerded out super hard with it.  
I saw them open for Judas Priest on their Angel of Retribution tour, what a great band!
I like to hear old songs like this especially if the songs is made before i was born.
Shame they went their seperate ways.... after the court proceedings.
Operation Mindcrime is still probably in my top 10 albums of all time.
First EP + The Warning > Everything else
My favourite album of all time.
Top 10 metal album.
I have yet to listen through all of it and I've tried three or four times now. Just doesn't click with me at all. It's not that the songs are bad, per se, but boy are they forgettable. It's the fact that it sounds like each song blends into the next and eventually what you're left with is a mid-paced mess, with mixing that does little to no justice to the instrumentation. The vocals are a bit naggy to boot because of how they're put forward in the mix. Not to mention some of the lyrics, yikes.
Bleh. White Pearl, Black Oceans Pt. II is cool (the first is one of my favorite Sonata Arctica songs) but the rest is really forgettable.
This has probably been asked before but I'm gonna go ahead and ask anyway

How the fuck do you prounce this band's name?
What's the colorful version of the album art on the video thumbnail?
I never understood all the hype that this band got :/
[i prefer the demo much more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRSesSiu360#t=8m21s)
wow, this sounds almost orchestral at times, great!
Saw these guys open for Watain and Mayhem, they absolutely killed it. I wasn't into them at the time, still kicking myself for not grabbing any of their merch 
You're welcome. Haha 
It should be the other way around: Godzilla - Bleeding
This shit is awesome.
Man I love this album.  I feel like it opened up to me over time to reveal little eddies of d-beat and punk and death underneath the shimmer of black metal.
This is such a beautiful album. I got downvoted posting this earlier, which I kiiinda get. It's hard to keep on calling it metal. But fuck it, great album.
Awesome album, the atmosphere is great, IMO easily one of the best albums of the year.
Sweet classic metal. I ought to explore more of their discography.
[LOUDNESS - Show Me The Way (Live)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-2VYybG5J0)

Akira Takasaki always had such a sick guitar tone.

RIP Munetaka Higuchi
*The Whole of the Law**

Great album, by the way.
Easily my favorite track on the newest record. The vocal harmonies in the earlier part of the song are just haunting.
Top 5 AOTY.
Really enjoying this album. It feels symmetrical.
Love this one and Broken Ground
Great track. The vocal harmonies, the way it all breathes and then collapses on itself. Albini is a perfect fit for them. I keep coming back to this record.
I like how the song breaks down towards the end.
Thanks for this! Forgot this album came out and I'm really enjoying it. Been a great year for metal!
Looking forward to seeing them again next month at Power of the Riff fest!

http://www.thepoweroftheriff.com
I think this album is somewhere in my top 5 Neurosis albums. I really like them all, but I was pleasantly surprised with this one.
As a big Neurosis fan, I was a bit dissapponted by this record, sadly. It lacks both the raw emotional power and the textures of their late 90's material, and the experimental arrangements and compositions of records like Eye of Every Storm. It's not a bad record by an stretch of the imagination, but it's a bit underwhelming from a band that we know are capable of so much more.
This album was a lot better than I actually thought it would be. Easily their best album since Character/Fiction. Eat a dick, In Flames.
Given the votes, I think Shreddit is getting tired of Dark Tranquillity...

Man, they always start off their albums with powerful songs. Encircled is a really great DT track, I could see it becoming a live staple.
Saw them in Toronto last night. Hell of a show.
Great new album
Good track, should maybe check out the rest of the album.
I like this track a lot. Seeing them live in a couple weeks!
Seeing them tonight!
Easily my favorite song off of this album. Amorphis are probably one of the most consistent bands in terms of quality releases.
The production kills this song for me. It's kind of showcasing how too clean of a production just kills feeling and brutality.

I mean, it could be 100x better, but it's still one of my favorite Amorphis songs, and Amorphis is probably my favorite band.
I discovered them because they opened for Nightwish, along with Arch Enemy. They were the first act and we were late so I missed them. It sucks because I really ended up liking their studio shit.
I was going to post this song last week, but forgot... The mix could use some work, but I think the songwriting is spectacular. Melodeath doesn't get much better than this song.
He's always had the best singers. Jeff Scott Soto was a personal favorite.
My favourite song on the album 
One of the better blind $7 records I've bought. 
Love this record. 
Necrosophuckingood
I always go back and forth between whether this version or the demo version is better, but this song is a standout on the album for sure.
This is amazing.
The song that got me into death metal. Thanks for posting this. 
This band never clicked with me, always seemed kinda boring.
Oh yeah, this album is the demons tits, fucking love it.

People who are tired of jerking it to Dissection should be directed to Necrophobic instead.
This is the most evil album ever written.
I hate the reissue artwork for this album so much I'm legit willing to pay the current prices for a 1st press edition. Other than that this album is absolutely killer.
I rarely see much discussion of these guys here. Surprised to see you post them 
Soen is god damn awesome!
Love Retaliate, not a bad track on it. This album almost single handedly got me into death metal. Totally unrelenting with an actual message behind the music.
Misery Index is consistently what a death band should be.  Solid.  Reliable.  Built Death Tough.
I'm pretty sure my first band opened for them about 10 years ago. Holy fuck time flies, I was still in high school
Speaking of diamonds...
[Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Last-Command-Wasp/dp/B000006PYP).
great album, kinda downhill from here.
Fuck yeah! Really really got crazy about these guys this summer after picking up the split with Satanic Warmaster. 
Probably my favourite currently active band. I do not count Slayer as currently active. 
These guys came through my area earlier this year, some absolutely disgusting death metal. Man they know how to write riffs.
back in the day, if you saw a chris moyen cover you knew it was worth buying the album or ep. 


This has been repressed on vinyl and CD. [Here's a store link](http://www.indiemerch.com/metalbladerecords/band/thrust).
Never heard this song before. 
One of the first Carcass songs I heard, believe it or not.
Every time these guys get posted I remember how amazing they were live.
Does anybody know any bands that sound similar to Tau Cross? I haven't really listened to anything that fits their sound.
Got a buddy who plays with one of the dudes in this band.
They had a tape available, but now the only way to buy this is digitally.

Here's their [bandcamp](https://pyromancer.bandcamp.com/releases), though this is a link to part of the bandcamp page anyway so... whatever.
Odd choice for a band name. I could see it working for something like crust/punk/raw black but this just sounds like any other name could be better. 
Such a killer album, love everything about it.
One of the better blind $4 record buys that I've ever made. 
That is one confusing title 
lol these band names crack me up, i should start making a list

love this album
Spit Out the Bone is the best track the band have done since the "...And Justice for All" album. Good god, I didn't know they still had that in them.
Well that was an awesome 77 minutes.  I'm happy as hell with this album.  I loved death magnetic but it was a little... I don't know, it felt like they re recorded b sides from older albums for death magnetic but this album has its own unique sound and that sound happens to be great.
> I also didn't see anything in the rules about making people aware of a leak

That's fine, you just can't post links to the leak.
Here's a very long review I wrote for the Metallica sub. 

Excellent album despite a couple of sub-par tracks.

There's certainly a slightly different approach to the song writing. The album features a lot of harmonised guitar melodies - especially on tracks such as 'Moth Into Flame','Atlas Rise' and 'Spit Out the Bone'. I can see why some people have been drawing comparisons to Iron Maiden (although I think the similarities are tenuous at best).

I'm a fan of the return of the big groovy 'Minus Human', '2x4' style riffs. I'm surprised 'Am I Savage' isn't getting more love, the main riff and the riff at 4mins10sec are fucking MASSIVE. 'Dream No More' also has big slabs of groove metal and heavy chugging throughout.

A couple of the songs have a lot going on and might take a few listens to fully appreciate. 'Halo of Fire' wasn't the classic Metallica power ballad I hoped it would be (there are no ballads on the record), but on repeat listens I think it might be one of of the best on the album. After the second chorus, the song breaks off into a few different sections before an absolutely epic finale. It's outstanding but might take a few play throughs to fully get into.

'Spit Out the Bone' starts off in similar vein to the title track (pure balls-out thrash) before diverting off into an array of guitar solos, dual guitar melodies and even a small bass solo. The song might seem a little bloated and over-long at first, but it's a fucking monster of a metal song. I'm glad the boys are still capable of this sort of thing after over 30 years of playing together.

'Now that We're Dead' sounds like it could fit comfortably on The Black Album or Load. It's mid-paced stomper with a simple enough structure, and while there's nothing wrong with it, it's not exactly their best work. It's not a song to skip past, but not one you'd be excited about hearing live.

There's no real need to say much about the title track, 'Moth Into Flame' or 'Atlas, Rise'. 'Moth' might be the best song on the album and one of the best they've done in many years, 'Hardwired' is a killer and concise thrash attack, and 'Atlas, Rise!', while perhaps the weakest of the three singles, is still an excellent song that sees the guys showing off their ability to put together songs with complex structures that still pack a punch.

Unfortunately the rumours are true, the second disc is quite weak on the whole. 'ManUNkind' has some cool Load-style bluesy riffs but the vocal melodies are sub-par and the song just isn't up the Metallica's usual high standard.

Same goes for 'Confusion', it's a mid-paced chuggathon that goes absolutely no where fast and despite a few head-nodding riffs, it's entirely forgettable. 'Here Comes Revenge' suffers from some cringey lyrics... 'REVENNNGE! YOU ASK FOR FORGIVENESS BUT I GIVE YOU REVENNNGE!' and doesn't offer any change of pace.
The biggest disappointment has to be 'Murder One'. How can a song about fucking LEMMY sound so uninspired? It's a yet another mid-paced rocker that offers no glimpse or spark of what made Motorhead so great, I doubt this song would have even made the cut for ReLoad for fucks sake.

All that aside, the first disc is a 9/10, with four excellent songs and two very good ones ('Now that We're Dead' and 'Dream No More'. The second disc is a 6.5/10 with an excellent song in 'Spit Out the Bone' and a very good song with 'Am I Savage.

I've been listening to the album all day and as a fan I really am loving it. Even the mediocre songs are still better than what most bands are putting out these days.

To conclude my rambling diatribe, I want to say a bit about Kirk. He needs to step up his game BIG TIME. His parts on this album are pretty much all the same versions of wah-wah drenched, bluesy solos in E minor he's been doing since 1991. What happened to the guy who wrote the solos to 'One' and 'The Unforgiven'? On 'Atlas Rise' he even repeats part of his solo from 'Suicide and Redemption'. It just seems lazy. It's James who writes all the melodic lead guitar parts, so can't even take credit for those. Plus, his excuse for having NO song-writing credits on the album is "I lost my phone". How does that fly? You'd better believe Mustaine would fire whoever the Megadeth guitar player of the week is for that bullshit.

Wow, pirating a new Metallica album *still* makes me giggle, even after all these years. 

Suck my balls, Lars, I may even seed this too! 

*edit*-geez, it's actually half-decent
I genuinely think this is really, really cool. Not, "good for Metallica in 2016," or, "at least they're heavy again." I genuinely enjoy this and see it being spun a fair amount. 


It's kinda like Black Album, Load and AJFA being put into a blender. I like it.
There are 8 or 9 songs out of the 12 on here that are really good(wouldn't even call the rest bad, just that I don't care for them), I'm happy these guys can still put out quality music. Really solid record imo.
I dont know about these super specific engineering and production complaints, but musically, as a long time Metallica fan and guitarist of 15 years, Death Magnetic was a hard fuckin album. They still had it then, and after hearing this album, i see they still have it now. 

My criticism of this album, musically, is Kirk. Man what I would give to hear the 80s/early 90s Kirk solo over these songs (especially Spit Out The Bone). James is on point. Speed is there. Dynamics are there. Pretty versatile album. I heard tastes of every album except Justice and St Anger in here on my first listen through. And im sure they're in there too. Very satisfied. 

Long Live Metallica \m/
Holy shit, James sounds vicious on Spit Out the Bone. This is great. 
Best they've done in years. Guaranteed purchase. Great album.
Nice. I really really like both Atlas Rise and Moth Into Flame so I'm excited for the rest of the album. 
completely agree. probably the best thing they've done since the Black album. Spit out the Bone sticks out as my favorite track. It sounds like it could be on Kill Em All.
I'm less than impressed with this. It's about what I was expecting: decent, but not really worth multiple listens when there's so much great stuff being made elsewhere. Spit Out the Bone is definitely their best track in 20+ years though, I will say that.

If you like modern Metallica, you'll love this. If not, this sure as shit isn't going to change your mind.
I feel like most of the second disc could have been omitted, a dirty 8 track album like master of puppets could have been sick:
hardwired,
atlas, rise,
now that we're dead,
moth into flame,
dream no more,
halo on fire,
am i savage,
spit out the bone
Some people get pretty bent out of shape about listening to leaks but I usually do it if there's an album I'm excited about. This is really good so far, I'm a fan of Death Magnetic (sue me) and I'm not sure yet whether I like this one better, but it certainly *sounds* better if that makes sense
Legitimate question because I've never quite understood, how exactly do albums get leaked? I see albums get leaked all the time but have never really understood what that means. 
This shit is fucking amazing! Best album since the Black album!
This is a great album. The songs sound way more cohesive than Death Magnetic, which had some really wonky transitions that didn't really fit. James sounds the best he has in years, and Kirk actually has some really memorable solos and melody lines that aren't wah drenched. So stoked on this. 
The album is solid, except for Lars like usual... Hardwired and Moth To Flame beckon for more double bass, triplets, decent rolls, blast beats, etc. Instead we get the same shitty performance Ulrich.  It's a shame really because if he would just PRACTICE and LEARN from a number drummers who have offered, this album would be fantastic.
Lars gets so much shit but he is far from the worst drummer. So I'm really confused how no one In the band has asked him to drum to come up with a drum fill that's not simply a snare roll of some sort. Dude has a hard on for his snare rolls. 
*Dream No More* is a beast.  It's almost teetering on the edge of doom metal.  And that "jam" towards the end of *Halo On Fire* is just so fucking cool.

I really enjoy the songs on Side 2 on their own, but they put too many song that are paced similarly together and it makes the album plod along.  Until *Spit Out the Bone*. Goddamn, what a track!

I'm really, really enjoying this album.  We'll see how it holds up over time.  Staying Power is the mark of a great album.

It's nice being excited about Metallica again, because it's been a long fucking time since I have been!
sounds pretty decent!  James sounds better than he has in a while.  Kirk is playing solos again that definitely sound like him but with a few small twists here and there.  The songwriting is much better.

No, it isn't my new favorite album or anything, but I am very happy with this so far considering how far Metallica has fallen and this is a big step in the right direction and I could see myself listening to tracks from this periodically.

My only major complaints:

* (perhaps this is just the shitty macbook speakers that are all I have listened through so far) The bass drum sound is annoying.  It sounds artificial.  It sounds almost like it is triggered and I absolute HATE triggered drum sounds...had to stop listening to a lot of death metal because if I heard one more triggered blast beat or double bass beat I was going to puke.

* Lars...I hate to jump on the "lars sucks" bandwagon...but a really good drummer would be able to add a LOT to this album.  He only plays really simple beats and almost ALL of his fills are done on the snare drum exclusively...  This sort of works on super fast thrashy songs that are all about energy anyways but when the tempo slows down it just feels lazy like he was laying down a temp-track to piece the song together but never re-recorded it with the real fills and beats in.  Whenever the rhythm does something out of the ordinary Lars seems to just hit the snare in-time with what James is singing instead of figuring out what he can play OVER the section.  A better "thrash" drummer would have been nice and on the some of the slower sections a more versatile "70s metal drummer" could have done some really cool things too (like a Bill Ward....somebody who knows how to work the kit and can keep time AND do complex fills even in transitional sections)

Oh well, Im not trying to shit on it, I am pleased with what I have heard so far and will actually give Metallica my money once it comes out as a reward for writing halfway decent music again.  I really feel like James was "on" for this album in a way he hasn't been in a while.
The production on this album is absolutely phenomenal. 
There are some moments from Black album,AJFA,MOP,Load,shortly their career.best thing they ever done since garage 
I'm really impressed by this album...it's good for any band's standard. It's not as good as their first 4 albums-and honestly anything else they ever do wont be. However I really think this is better than anything else they've done.
After hearing it all u can think is how good it would have been as a Hetfield solo album. The songs are great just brought down by the most unimaginative, boring drumming possible and lackluster lead work. If it was James with guest musicians it would be amazing.
James:   Still kickin strong

Kirk :  Still crankin' out killer solos with great and classic metallica tone

Rob:  Still highly overlooked and probably always will be.  Sad considering how much a cool dude and great bass Player he is.

And of course Lars: Really odd to see such a prolific band like Metallica missing what  is arguably one of the most important parts of a really good rock band, not just metal.  I think it's worth noting that when drummers age, they show their age clearer than any other instrument in that it's almost pure physical exertion.


Overall I feel like it all sounds very cohesive, but also produced out the wazoo (but what isnt these days).  Probably worth noting Sirius XM has overplayed the album so much by this point it's makin me sick.  
I'd say it's a 7/10 album for me. The first half of disc two is all filler, but I honestly think they've done themselves justice on this album, and Now That We're Dead, Moth Into Flame, and Spit Out the Bone are some classic Metallica tunes.

Kinda like Star Wars Ep. VII. It doesn't live up to the classics, but it recaptures the magic for a little bit. I'm satisfied, and excited for the north american tour.
I cant help but think the drums are way too loud. As they have been for my tastes in the last 2 albums also. I also wish they'd focus on Robert Trujillo a little more.
I am really pleased by this album. Didn't like the singles all that much (except for Atlas, Rise), so I'm glad that they are one of the weaker tracks on this. Here Comes Revenge and Now That We're Dead aren't great eiter, especially HCR, which might as well be the worst on the album. 

There's a couple of really cool tracks, not too memorable, but cool nonetheless, such as Manunkind, Murder One, Confusion and Am I Savage, and 3 absolutely, in my opinion, killer songs, which are Dream No More, Spit Out The Bone, and Halo On Fire.
The first being probably my favourite with its menacing, brooding riffs and really awesome lyrics. Spit Out The Bone literally sounds like pre TBA Metallica and would fit onto any of these albums without having to be ashamed of anything. Great vocals and I absolutely love the second half. Halo On Fire is a great song, too, and could easily be the true followup to Unforgiven, being a better song than both II and III.

Overall, the album pleasantly surprised me and I think it might be case with most Metallica fans (which I'm not that much of, but I was really curious about this album). 8/10, and if you cut 4 of the weakest tracks (Hardwired, Moth Into Flame, Here Comes Revenge and Now That We're Dead) possibly even a 9.
I'll wait until I can get a hold of a physical copy, if only because I'm a computer noob and don't know how/care to download things. That being said, I'm pumped to hear Spit Out the Bone based on everyone's reaction to it.
Don't forget to buy it guys. 
And it is actually way better than I thought it was going to be. 
I've listened to 10 out of the 12 tracks several dozen times. "Revenge" is a track I am warming up to so I will probably start listening to it more. I am not digging Murder One but I will give it a shot down the line. My favorite track, right now (and obviously this can change) is Confusion. It was a song I at first kind of didn't feel but the more I listened the more I fell for it. Also, the lyrics are really good as James gets into some solid PTSD issues.
i downloaded it twice just to shove it up lars's ass hahaha
I really love Halo on Fire to me it´s like a mix between  unforgiven and maybe one
Can't wait to listen to the album, i really like Moth Into Flame (dat solo.... dayum), hope the rest of the album is on par.
I'm sure I'd like it if I gave it a chance, but I listened to it directly after Meshuggah's "The Violent Sleep Of Reason". It's a bit hard to dial it back a bit after that.
Good to hear. I've pre-ordered the album and look forward to hearing more tracks. 
I'm really happy with this album. I've been waiting for 8 years. Finally! I like it! Can't wait to pick it up on friday.
Yeah, people tend to dump on anything because it's not the same as the old stuff (come on, let's be real, it's really difficult to make anything feel like that again, even if age and such were a constant), but I've quite liked this album so far.  I'm sure I'm going to listen to it more than Death Magnetic.
This album is awesome, I had high hopes and they didn't disappoint. Bring on the tour. 
I'll give it a try for sure. It's been years since I listen to a Metallica album from beginning to end. Enjoyed the couple of introductory tracks, even if I don't see myself revisiting them ever again.

Anyway, I celebrate the change in Hetfield's voice, which was the most obnoxious thing for me in the post-BA records.
Hetfield on vocals and the band itself showed a little range which was nice.  
Well, I pre-ordered the deluxe version, so there's nothing wrong with looking into this...
So many riffs. 
Well I've listened to the whole thing a couple of times now. Some of the songs have a Load/ReLoad vibe, which I actually like (flame on!). But mostly it's pretty boring. James's riffing just isn't that good anymore. It's like the kind of stuff you come up with while you're noodling around in your room or whatever.  It isn't bad; it just isn't that good either.  It's decent if bland.

But I'll keep listening to it and see how it grows on me.﻿
I know it's pretty common to shit on Metallica these days (and I hate to be that guy) but... there's really nothing spectacular about this album. Is it 10 times better than anything on 'St. Anger'.? Sure. Does it have more balls than anything on the 'Load' albums.? Absolutely! Does that mean this is by far the best thing Metallica has done since 'Justice'.? Not really, but it's definitely a step in the right direction.
It's true that Lars loves the smell of his own farts. What gets me about this album so far is that it is in your face, much like the old stuff. I hear a lot of kill em all especially in Hardwired. The band seems like they are fucking killing it except Lars. No complexity, that shitty snare roll, his off beat kick drum, and the fact that he's not in time. 
I'm just on my third listen-through and I like 'Hardwired...' a lot. The production is good, the songs are on point and you can clearly hear they've revisited the old albums. Catchy riffing all around too, which should work well in a live setting, and James' vocals sound great. My only criticism is that the album is perhaps somewhat too long. Two or three songs less would have worked just as well, I think.
Does "Now That We're Dead" give off a Ozzy's "No More Tears"-vibe for anyone else?
cool, will give it a listen. i actually enjoyed death magnetic, so sounds like this will be as good or better
I quite like it, Spit Out the Bone is obviously the stand-out since it seems the only song that harkens back to the older material.

But all in all it's pretty ok, nothing fantastic though. 
I'm halfway through it so far and loving it! So far "Confusion" is best for me.

Idk where to get it....
They need to stop sending early copies to Mustain. He does this every time.
Fuck, if they could only mix this album similar to Master or Justice (With bass) it'd be great, not a fan of the drums.
Anyone else be satisfied with the album as is but just wish James' vocals had that old 80s reverb?
I swear i can't find the album anywhere. Am i being tricked? can someone send me a link to where i can listen?
*looks around*  
  
Who the fuck are all these people who I've never seen before???
It's meh.  The new Testament though... bad ass. 
I'm gonna try my damnedest to not listen to it until I get my copy 
Yeah, James's voice is definitely better than it's been in awhile. I think it would've been a more solid album if Lars could've been replaced with a better drummer. I just wish Lars would just take off so 'Tallica can grab Lombardo. Would've should've could've I guess.
Huge fan of CD 1, and then the last two tracks on the second disc. I'm loving the variety they brought, too. I hear a little bit from close to every album in there.
Confusion! all sanity is now beyond me !!!!!
Damn bruh, this album is rad dope bruh. After Lulu I thought this guys were done, but they just warmin up bruh. Spit out the bone is radical
[removed]
I'm just here to see everyone jump on the "Lars sucks" bandwagon.
It's funny how everyone talks so much trash about the guy who's been drummer in one of the most successful bands in the world for the past 30+ years.
I think it stems from lack of success on their own part, and jealousy. It's okay boys, you'll break out of mommy and daddy's garage some day!
I can't believe I'm saying this. But the album is one of the worst things I've heard all year. So dry, so lazy, so shitty. They should be ashamed of putting that piece of shit out for money. Terrible.
I ordered the deluxe edition.

Not really relevant but at least I'm seeing a lot of positivity.
Just giving it a first listen now.

The drums sound like shit. That kick drum?

2 discs running at 77 minutes in total. Why didn't they just chuck it on the one disc?
With everything else out there of actual quality, can't imagine I'd bother wasting time with this. 

[deleted]
Sweet, I can not ever listen to it even sooner. 
Metallica died after AJFA. 

Is this one 192kbs  encoded as well?

Link anyone?
Can someone pm me a link of Spit out the bone?

Too many people raving about the song for me not to get a bit of a taste of it, before release.
sadly enough, i don't care about metallica enough anymore to even bother pirating it. I'll hold on to my oldman  memories of the past.
[Napster Bad!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIuR5TNyL8Y)
It sounds generic. With exceptions, there isn't anything setting these songs apart from a random generic Metallica old song. 

It sounds like they gave up on creating anything new or different sounding. I wouldn't blame them though, they get a lot of negative review whenever they do anything that isn't pure oldschool trash metal. It's either get flamed or get stuck on time for Metallica, and this time they chose to please the fans and go back to the 90's.
WTF? Quit it and act like a real fan.
It's already on the radio and it's crap
Takes me back to the days when I was 14...  Death Magnetic leaked early too, and I was like "Yeah, take that Lars!"
So who are they gonna sue now that Napster is gone?
metallica is dead

First line of description: "THIS IS NOT AN EP"

Don't piss off the Arctopus!
always upvote colin marston
That was pretty badass. If you ever get the chance to see these guys live I'd highly suggest that you do so.
Great album.
Love that opening riff 
Pentagram kills,  but   black metal?   LMFGDAO. 

Pentagram Chile is a riff making machine, love 'em.
Fuck. Yes.

I'm guessing you have enjoyed your time listening to this album, otherwise you probably wouldn't have posted this song.
I'm trying to think of something more generic sounding than this. 
The production is bizarre; The bass is annoying as fuck all, too. 

Would be interesting to know what label would have picked them up if they hadn't disbanded.
I like this a lot
/r/metalcore is two doors down, son
This is actually pretty damn good, but as it's been said, the rules are rules, this should go to /r/metalcore
I think this is my album of the year so far
It's so nice to have audible bass back in thrash.
"The darkness possessing - you thought that you could, the blood starts to freeze in your veins"

Unrelated but oh so related.
My favorite track from Windir. This was the first time I had ever heard melodies like that in Black metal
Who is this Windir, I've never heard of them and especially this song before?
Black Metal From Greece.

This is my drummers other band. Super stoked for them to get picked up for Maryland Deathfest next year. Johnny and Adam are good dudes and write some disgusting grind.
